My grown kids played the first games, then newer came along with grandkids playing...It's a fun game for the whole family to enjoy..so saddle up and try it out..if you like the Old West. Look out for the rivers and such...........Good Luck"
2,open-ended,0439381673,"It says above platform Mac, but I see in the questions that it does not for Mac Book Pro. What about regular Mac desktop??",,"I used it with a pc. So, I have no idea. I hope it works for you. I really liked this as did the children in my class. We made it all the way to Ft. Vancouver."
3,yes/no,0439381673,Will this work for Mac OS X?,N,No it has to have a Mac that runs on power pc not Intel processors
4,yes/no,0439381673,"I have Windows7, Will this work on my computer?",?,"Hi T.Lee, I have not had any trouble running this on Windows 7. The OS will work fine."
5,yes/no,0439381673,Will this work on Windows XP?,Y,Yes! :P
6,open-ended,0439381673,what about windows 8?,,Works well had to changes few settings when I first downloaded it
7,open-ended,0439381673,I have a Macbook Pro - will it work on that?,,Nope. I found out the hard way. Sorry!

10,yes/no,0615179088,I'm taking a corse in japanese but what to suplement my classes with something that i can play while i sleep as a suplement. Is this a good choice?,N,"No because it's not a listening course. It really is something you must read and take notes on so in this case, for the purpose that you're looking for, this product would not suit. However, I can suggest something for you that you may also buy on Amazon. Even though Human Japanese is an AWESOME learning tool, if you're wanting to play something in your sleep to help you tune in to the way a native speaker talks, buy yourself a book called 'Read Real Japanese.' There is an audio CD that comes with this book wherein the stories are read. You can get a real good sense of speech speed as well as start getting used to picking out words you know. It's a great sleep tool because it's interesting enough without being droning lessons and you'll start to feel yourself compelled to pick apart the speech and translations. So both products are good but Read Real Japanese is the one I'd recommend for the purposes you're aiming for and keep Human Japanese for the thing you tinker with on weekends between classes or get it on your kindle so you can read through it on the go."
11,open-ended,0615179088,Supporting windows 8 ??,,"Yes, Human Japanese runs great on Windows 8, as long as your device can run traditional Desktop applications."
12,open-ended,0615179088,Looking for Japanese Exercise Book: Does anyone have any recommendations?,,"You've probably already figured out a solution to your question, but I figured that I would post here because my answer may help others. (Have you found a workbook that you like? If so, please post back.) You could grab an additional textbook that includes exercises, or just the corresponding workbook. Genki is a very popular textbook series that many people seem to enjoy. You could buy just the Genki workbooks to save money, as well as the answer book if you want the answers. You may need to skip around depending on what grammar point you are learning from The Manga Way/Human Japanese. I'm using Japanese for Everyone and I like it, but it is pretty fast-paced, explanations are relatively brief, so it isn't for everyone. It has about 10-15 exercises per chapter, and the answers are included in the back. It's also cheap, ~$20, though it looks like Amazon doesn't have any in stock at the moment. You can also try practicing what you've learned on Lang8.com and get native speakers to correct your diary entries. White Rabbit Press and The Japan Shop (online stores) also have some workbooks you could try. (I haven't tried any of them, otherwise I'd recommend a couple)."
13,yes/no,0615179088,will it work on windows 8,?,My version (2.0.5) does.
14,yes/no,0615179088,does this work on a mac,?,"No, but you can go into the app store on your mac and buy it, for perhaps less. :)"
15,open-ended,0615179088,"Is this the same software as well, that is called ""Human Japanese Intermediate"" by Human Japanese / Brak Software, or is it harder or better than that one?",,"Hi, I'm sorry but I'm not familiar with that one, but it looks like the continuation of the other one. I'm guessing it would be harder (more advanced) and continue from where the first one ended. Hope this helps."
16,yes/no,0615179088,Is this program compatible with Mac??,?,Platforms Windows 7 / Vista / XP Home Edition
17,yes/no,0615179088,would it give you the words you need if you were to take a week long trip to japan,Y,"Hi Colt, Yes, it will teach you the main phrases, vocabulary and sentence structure for a week long trip. The program is equivalent to the first year Japanese curriculum. Enjoy your trip to Japan. You might also want to try watching free youtube channels that teach the basic Japanese for tourists."
18,yes/no,0615179088,can you speak fluent japanese after this program is done?,Y,"You will learn the basic things, and it helps with memorization. I recommend you buy these other books along with Human Japanese.... ""Kanji Pict-O-Graphix: Over 1,000 Japanese Kanji and Kana Mnemonics"" ""Japanese In 10 Minutes a Day"" ""Outrageous Japanese: Slang, Curses & Epithets"" ""Read Japanese today"" ""Read and Speak Japanese for Beginners A Guide to Reading and Writing Japanese (English and Japanese Edition)"" ""Easy Japanese: A Direct Approach to Immediate Conversation"" and possibly a Japanese dictionary. It takes more than one source to be fluent. All of the books I mentioned can be bought used for 1 cent, along with 4 dollar shipping and handling fees. Any other questions?"
19,yes/no,0982583885,"Do you have to provide proof that you are a student? (Older versions did, though it was made clear in the product discription.)",?,When I registered they did ask me where I went to school and what year I was in and there was a disclaimer saying if they beleive I am not a student they would contact me and require an enrolment verification letter
20,open-ended,0982583885,MathWork says that the Student Version R2013a comes with a mac version is that correct?,,"Yes, you can install MATLAB and Simulink Student Version on a Mac"
21,yes/no,0982583885,is it compatable with lego mindstorms EV3?,?,I do not use MATLAB with this device MATLAB Help lists the following references: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/88078-support-for-lego-mindstorms-ev3 https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Lego+EV3

24,yes/no,0982583885,Will this product work on windows 8.1?,Y,Yes it works on windows 8.1. I own a laptop that runs on windows 8.1 and my MATLAB program runs perfectly. I hope I was able to be of help.
25,yes/no,0982583885,is it compatable with window 7 ultimate (64-bit)?,Y,Yes that is my exact situation and the 32 bit student version does work on my 64 bit windows 7 ultimate machine.
26,open-ended,0982583885,How do I get Matlab if I'm not enrolled in a school? I'm an 84 year old retired engineer,,"You have to buy the full product from math works.com for $500, I think. You need an email address that ends in .edu if you want to use the Student Version."
27,open-ended,0982583885,What happen if I format my windows laptop after I install Matlab on it? Will I lose the license??,,"NO, You will not lose the license."
28,yes/no,0982583885,Does the R2013a benefit and run faster on 64bit OS ?,?,All I got when I ordered Version R2013a was the 32 bit version. If the program isn't written to take advantage of a 64 bit system there should be no speed improvement. I don't have any problems running it on Windows 7 Professional 64 bit though.
29,open-ended,160717930X,Which coarse provide the best results for beginner conversation,,"Jane: I got this for my grandson, who is 6, in a French Immersion school. This worked perfectly for him."
30,yes/no,160717930X,I have an older MAC (OSX 10.4); will this run on my MAC? The specs indicate 'yes' but I'd like to be sure.,?,I am the grandmother So I will forward this question to our daughter who is the homeschoing mom
31,open-ended,160717930X,"Will this program work with Windows 8? The Rosetta Stone website says it will, but is this a different product? It is quite a bit cheaper on Amazon.",,"I don't know, I don't have Windows 8. What is Amazon's return policy for software?"
32,yes/no,1607179245,Does it work with Windows 8?,Y,Yes
33,open-ended,1607179245,"Will the headset work with two children? And, is there a workbook included?",,"The lessons can be done repeatedly, so you can use it for two children. Using the same headset for both of them should not interfere. The workbook is included on a CD with the home school versions and you can print it off or get it printed off at somewhere like FedEx Kinko's for about $10-$15."
34,yes/no,1607179245,Can I install this on my laptop in addition to my desk top?,Y,"It's good for only 2 installs. So yes, you should be able to. I had a computer crash recently right after installing and had to use my 2nd and last install. I called Rosetta and asked about this and they acted like they will make exceptions and to call them when I need to install again."
35,yes/no,1607179245,does it work with Windows 7 ?,Y,Yes. That's what we are running it on.
36,open-ended,1607179245,I see one comment about mac users. what are others experiences? does it work well?,,I do not have a MAC. I use windows & this program is wonderful. It is very user friendly. I would ask Rosetta Stone customer service this question.
37,yes/no,1607179245,Can the CDs be loaded on more than one computer so each child can do lesson at the same time?,?,You can only use the code/load the CDs twice. But you can go through the lesson as many times as you want. So you can just put it on one computer and have each child do it separately.
38,open-ended,1608293017,homeschool edition: What is the difference between Rosetta Stone Spanish 1-5 and the homeschool edition?,,you get workbooks you can print
39,open-ended,1608293017,How many users are possible? I teach in a small school and need a product that can support up to 15 users.,,you may have up to 5 users on 2 separate computers for a total of 10. Hope that helps.
40,yes/no,1608293017,Does this work with windows 7?,Y,It works great with Windows 7 as well as Vista.
41,yes/no,1608293017,Is this product the same as the one that retails for over $399 on other websites?,?,It is. My grandchildren love it and are always ready to do their lessons.
42,open-ended,1608293017,Does the Home School version limit the amount of time you have to use the product? I read it gives you 3moths and that's it? Is it 5 users? Version3?,,"My daughter has been using this for over 2 years. We have never added other users so I don't have the answer to that question. My daughter took spanish for 3 years in school; 8th, 9th and 10th grade. She decided to pick it back up in college and Rosetta Stone helped her to bridge the two year gap. She also learned more than prior years in school. I would definately recommend this software."
43,open-ended,1608293017,Our Microphone isn't recognized on the mac with OS X 10.9.4. Any suggestions?,,Well I am not to sure what you can do but since mac is a apple product maybe using some apple headphones could help with the problem. once again I am not to sure myself but if that helps then awesome. hope that helps
44,open-ended,1608293017,Our Microphone isn't recognized on the mac with OS X 10.9.4. Any suggestions?,,"I don't have a suggestion. When I purchased ours, it was for a PC. However, I did not know that it was for xp and 2000, I believe. Fortunately my parents have a laptop with xp and my daughter is able to use it. I do not remember seeing a choice for operating systems, except for the PC/MAC difference. I noticed on the back of our box it is dated 2009."
45,open-ended,1608293017,What version is this?,,"Hi Leah... I am not sure what you are asking? This product has a description::Rosetta Stone Homeschool teaches your student a new language naturally, the same way they mastered their first language. Innovative solutions get them speaking new words, right from the start. Rosetta Stone Homeschool moves forward only when your student is ready--you set the schedule and your student drives the pace. Parent Administrative Tools allow you to formulate lesson plans, manage your student's progress and track their success. Audio Companion CDs let them reinforce the Rosetta Stone experience anytime, anywhere. My daughter hadn't taken spanish for about 4 years and used this to brush up so she could take spanish in college. She found this very helpful. She continues to use this at higher levels as well. Hope this answers your question."
46,open-ended,1608293017,What is the Audio companion?,,"It is a cd for practice, but my kids have never used it through the first two levels."
47,yes/no,1608293017,Does this work for windows 8,Y,"The short answer is, SOMETIMES. It's a very touchy program with Windows 8. Very frustrating when it doesn't always work properly. I often regret having wasted my money on it."
48,open-ended,1608297128,How is this different from the regular Rosetta Stone French Level 1-5?,,"Homeschool version has several different extras; it provides a disc with pdf files for worksheets, quizzes and tests with answers; 36 or 45 week teaching plan, application also has a homeschool panel that displays all computer lessons and grades earned with overall grad average and time spent on each section, and total time used. Application also allows you to select a starting level if you have prior French knowledge."
49,yes/no,1608297128,Does this set come with the headset microphone?,Y,I have the Rosetta Stone Version 3 French Level 1-5 with Homeschool option and my set up did come with a headset microphone.
50,open-ended,1608297128,Will this be version 2 or 3? I notice the photo says 2; however on other sets (Spanish- Latin America) the photo says 2 while the info says 3. Thanks!,,The installed software says version 3
51,yes/no,1608297128,Will this version work with mac Mavericks?,Y,Yes it worked on my mac
52,yes/no,1608297128,Can the CDs be played in the car while you drive??,Y,"Yes, but there is only one or two CDs. They correlate with the lessons but in a very broad sense."
53,yes/no,1608297128,are there books in addition to cds?,?,The quick answer is no. But the course is so well put together that you don't need books. I was impressed this how intuitive the coursework is presented. You really don't need books and there is a help facility that explains how to use the software. I am thinking of learning another language because I feel like I am there working with someone who knows the language.
54,open-ended,1608297128,I am looking into getting this prduct. I have a MOS apple and it does not have the disk drive. I was wondering if i would have to by the attatchment in order to install this product or how it works. I dont want to spend that much money on something...,,"Yes you would need to buy something to put the CD in, I hope that this is helpful. There are a lot of discs, but I like the program."
55,yes/no,1608297128,Does this allow for multiple users? I want to buy it for the family and have each of us use it independently but on the same computer.,?,"I have three kids, who each have their own account and can navigate independent of each other with the program."
56,open-ended,1608297128,what is the diference bettween the Rosetta Stone Homeschool French Level 1-5 and theRosetta Stone French Level 1-5 Set ?,,The only difference that I've noticed is that the home school version comes with lesson plans.
57,open-ended,1608297128,What is difference between the Homeschool version vs. the standard version?,,"Never had the regular version but the Homeschool version allows you to track progress and score. It provides worksheets, quizes and tests. Also, you receive a few different lesson ideas to plan out your year. I believe alot of the video and audio and such is the same but not for sure."
58,open-ended,1608292983,Hi i hava a mac with maverick sofware OSX 10.9.4 and i want to know if it's compatible with this software. Thanks,,"I bought this for someone else, but I bought a ""learn Spanish"" version 5 years ago and it runs fine on my Mac with Maverick"
59,open-ended,1608292983,What is the difference in the homeschool verson &amp; the other?,,"I am not exactly sure what the ""other"" includes. The homeschool version is organized in a curriculum with regular tests and quizes and also includes PDF files you can print out as written exercises and a ""teacher guide."" I would expect the non-homeschool version probably does not include these."
60,open-ended,1608292983,Is this edition targeted to grade school-aged learners or is this edition suitable for adult learners as well?,,Yes it is well-suited to adult learners
61,yes/no,1608292983,my italian friend wants to learn English. Would he be able to learn off this version if he only speaks Italiano??,Y,Yes
62,open-ended,1608292983,Is it only for 1 computer? Can I install my laptop and Desktop?,,You can
63,yes/no,1608292983,Can I use the software with windows 8?,Y,"Don't know- but I don't see why it wouldn't work with Win 8 or Win 8.1. I think you should send Rosetta Stone that question, however- that's a pretty good question and they should have an answer- I'm thinking there may be problems with the video playback."
64,yes/no,1608292983,Can I use software with windows 7?,Y,"Yes, you can."
65,open-ended,1608299708,what does it mean you have to re add the language every 3 months,,"Thats is the online features like the one-on-one lessons with a teacher, or the different language games you can play to help you learn. The core Rosetta stone program will stay installed on you comp but you will have to subscribe to keep the online features."
66,yes/no,1608299708,Can the discs be used in the disc player in the car?,?,"I haven't tried putting the discs in the car's CD player. Rosetta Stone program is visual as well as auditory, so it would not work while you're driving. There is a Rosetta Stone smartphone app that syncs with your lesson progress and could be used if you're a passenger."
67,open-ended,1608299708,we have this on two computers in different countries and two users can we keep where we are up to on both computers,,yes
68,open-ended,1608299708,I understood from one of the users that the CD roms stop working after a time whereupon you need to pay extra. True?,,I haven't come across that issue as of yet. I immediately installed all 3 disks upon arrival although I'm still currently working in the first disk I can't imagine why the others wouldn't work just as this one is. No prompts or issues during download. My packaging was sealed as if from supplier itself. Hope that helps
69,yes/no,1608299708,does the program have a time limit for usage on it,N,"No, but every 3 months you have to re add the language, which is not a hard process"
70,yes/no,1608299627,You bought level one . Will you buy the next levels?,Y,"Midway through I tried out Pimsleur and I found it a lot more practical than Rosetta Stone. Eventually I switched to group classes. In general I would say RS is great for a quick start and vocabulary, Pimsleur is great for practical phrases but in the end there's nothing like a real teacher."
71,yes/no,1608299627,Will you buy the next level edition,?,My grandson likes the program and finds it easy to ue.
72,yes/no,1608299627,Did you learn Chinese,?,"Not through Rosetta Stone. For 5 months I worked Rosetta Stone every day and it did not produce fluency of any kind. My previous post will tell you why. I purchased a language suite from ""Transparent Language"" a lot cheaper and much more productive and portable on my tablet."
73,yes/no,1608297144,Does this come with the headset?,?,The version of Rosetta Stone that I purchased from Amazon that included both the standard and homeschool versions. The box contained one set of headphones/microphone.
74,yes/no,1608297144,Will this product work with a new Mac as well?,Y,"yes, or at least according to the install manual it comes with it should work."
75,yes/no,1608297144,"Does ""Homeschool"" mean that this is meant for kids?",?,"You can tailor the program to focus more on speaking and understanding for younger learners and you can track their progress with the homeschool function, but otherwise I think the overall content is the same as the adult program. I kind of wish it was more fun and engaging for little kids, but my kids think its kind of boring, but they do it anyway. They are 7 and 4. I have to help the 4 year old because she can't read yet, so its not as awesome as I had hoped, but there's really nothing better."
76,yes/no,1608297144,Does it have the online chat with a person who speaks Italian like the regular version does?,?,I don't believe so
77,yes/no,1608297144,"Does it support more than 1 student, can I also use it to learn along with my daughter?",?,"The program allows up to 5 users at a time, but can only be loaded to one device. If you put it on a device you both have access to, (aka a family computer) you will both be able to use it."
78,yes/no,1608299988,Is a original rossetta stone,Y,"yes, it was bought via Amazon but was authentically Rosetta Stone."
79,open-ended,1608299988,Does the set include the actual DVDs or is it a subscription?,,Unless it says just downloads yes it has dvds. The one I got from amazon had dvds
80,yes/no,1608299988,are the discs able to be used on my ipad,N,No
81,yes/no,1608299988,Does it teach grammer?,?,To an extent. It's mostly focused on the identification and pronunciation of words but you end up learning the different conjugations along the way.
82,open-ended,1608299988,audio companion versus download only version,,Does it make any difference? Have the online support and lessons is excellent so ensure you have that
83,open-ended,1608299988,On how many computers can you download this product?,,My instructions said that I could install Rosetta Stone onto 2 computers.
84,yes/no,1608299988,Is the headset &amp; mic good quality,Y,"I was not provided with a headset, the box I received had earbuds with a mic attached. I couldn't get it to work, then realized that it only worked if I spoke into the earbuds themselves. I contacted Rosetta Stone asking for a replacement because my earbuds seemed to be wired backwards. They kept sending me directions on how to install them, which I did. They didn't seem to understand that it was the earbuds/mic itself that was faulty. I finally went out and just bought my own headset for $30, and it works great."
85,open-ended,1608299988,"Do the various levels equate to high school and college foreign language requirements? If so, which levels for which grades?",,"College language classes move at a much faster pace than High School. Where the actual levels line up with each of them would be hard to assess. I think the product is a good one, potentially better at refreshing the knowledge of someone who used to speak a language rather than learning with no prior experience. That said, I warn you this company has the worst customer service I have even dealt with. I have RS system updates of every level pending since November and I won't implement them because they are very likely to trash the entire package and I just know want to go through that merry-go-round again. This is a fairly expensive bit of software to be treated so unprofessionally as has been my experience with them."
86,yes/no,1608299988,Does this come with the workbooks?,?,"No, No workbooks. All work is done on the computer - audio, speaking, visual, typing."
87,open-ended,1608299988,How much hard disk space does this program take? I have a MacBook Air with limited room.,,600MB free hard drive space (per level)
88,yes/no,1608299775,Will this Rosetta Stone English (American) - Level 1-5 Set include the Iphone app for free?,Y,Yes
89,open-ended,1608299775,Which Rosetta Stone package do I need to purchase to go from Spanish to English,,"1-5 set, you would want to do the whole thing. Good luck"
90,open-ended,1608299775,How many computers can I install Rosetta Stone program?,,"I'm pretty sure you can install it on multiple computers. I only tried it on one. While the program ran just fine, I was disappointed with the method of learning so I no longer used it. It focused only on memorizing words and phrases. It didn't focus at all on grammar. Unfortunately, it was a high price to pay just to be disappointed with the program's teaching method."
91,yes/no,1608299775,will it work if I download it in the US and install in another computer n another country?,Y,Yes! Absolutely! You can install the program in the country you want. ;)
92,open-ended,1608299775,Would this work for Mexican (Latin American?) Spanish speaking people?,,"Yes, I have seen a dramatic improvement in vocabulary, pronunciation, and communications. Mi lengua natal es el espanol, y eh aprendido muy rapidamente el ingles."
93,yes/no,1608299775,"My wife's english is ok, but her grammar is what needs work. Will this help?",N,"No. This is not good for grammar. It was the same case for my wife, so we have to google grammar lessons to understand how a particular sentence is built. This software teaches you what objects are called in english and basic sentence formation. But it does not tell you ""why and how"" this sentence is built this way."
94,open-ended,1608299775,"How many users does it support? I want my kids to learn, each on their own pace. Is that possible?",,"Hi Eran, apoligize I will not be able to answer this question, only my wife used the software."
95,open-ended,1608299775,which version to use for Windows7 ?,,I have version 4 on Windows 7. Not sure if they have made one that requires version 8.
96,open-ended,1608299775,in how long can you learn English from Spanish?,,"The more you study the better you'll get.Like with everything it will take time,but that depends on you.every one is different,just don't give."
97,yes/no,1608299775,will rossetta stone make a native speaker,?,No but the results will speak for themselves. I got it for my wife who is Japanese. She made leaps and bounds from the year that she used it. She actually still uses it. Loves it because of all the confidence it provided her to go out and use her English. I recommend it.
98,yes/no,1617160040,Do you see words written as well as hearing them spoken? I'm a visual learner and audio-only is useless to me-- although a combination would be great.,Y,Yes
99,yes/no,1617160040,does it work with windows 8?,?,"I don't know but I'm getting ready to re-install it after not using it for 6-8 months, on my new laptop with touchscreen and Win8. I can comment when I do it."
100,yes/no,1617160040,can two people take at the same time,N,"I am not sure about the question but Rosetta Stone gives you headphones and you have to speak the language unless you do not want to use the speech part. It keeps up with your progress and you have to finish sentences and answer questions,etc. so I guess the answer would be no."
101,yes/no,1617160040,does it work on windows vista?,?,"I checked the Rosetta Stone box and it says it operates on the following: Windows XP SP3, Vista SP2, Windows 7 and Windows 8. Hope this helps."
102,open-ended,1617160040,How many people can use the software?,,From Rosetta Stone's website FAQ: I purchased the Rosetta Stone Language Learning CD-ROM. How many computers can I install the software on? The software can be installed on up two computers for use for up to five family members
103,yes/no,1617160377,i'm traveling to italy to visit relatives who do not know english. i do not have an easy grasp on learning languages. will this work?,?,"I too am not one to learn languages easily. At the age of 56. I was reluctant to try. However, this program made it fun and as easy as possible for me. I look forward to spending time with this. IT IS worth the money. Best Wishes for your visit to Italy. As a side note, my husband lost his camera while visiting Italy. We had taken a picture of our name and address as the first picture on the memory chip. A wonderful Italian man found it and mailed it to us. The camera came home before my husband! Enjoy your trip!"
104,open-ended,1617160377,Can more than one person use this software? Or is it limited by user specific codes or something. Thank you!,,There are three people using it in our home on the same computer. It remembers where each of us left off and we share the earphones that come with it. I think three or four may be the limit but I am not sure. Enjoy!
105,open-ended,1617160377,RS Does not install on Mac OS X: Anyone out there successfully installed any RS version on a Mac running OS X??,,Way to bad I didn't see this one before I ordered. One would expect a responsible vendor to quit carrying it. Right Amazon!
106,open-ended,1617160377,Can you please tell me if this is compatible with Mac Mountain Lion or Mavericks?,,No
107,yes/no,1617160377,will this download and run off pc windows 8,Y,I am not sure but I believe there would be a Rosetta Stone version for windows. The product is great. I would get in touch with RS directly and ask the question. It worked perfectly for me on a Mac.
108,open-ended,1617160377,My daughter has a macbook... will this work or not??,,"Yes, absolutely. I can't remember when we bought it if you had to select Mac or windows but ours works perfectly. Check before you order."
109,yes/no,1617160377,"Has anyone tried to install it only to get an ""1141 Fatal application error"" and the only solution is to close the program?",?,Not me. I'd call customer service.
110,open-ended,1617160377,what will Level 1 do for me? I can't find anything that tells me if Level 1 is sufficient for learning some Italian just for the fun of it.,,"Hi, Timmy: You should be able to learn from Level 1 Italian to get by. Although I think it would be easier had there been English along with the lessons which are mostly pictures and the oral Italian phrases and sentences with each picture. Not what I expected."
111,yes/no,1617160377,"Is this download only or do I get CDs? What about the online ""interactive"" portion - how valuable is that, being of no use to me as I have dialup Internet.",?,"Roy, I believe it's download only. However, I am away for a few weeks so I can't give you an exact answer. I would check the kit, if I was at home. I really got a lot out of the interactive portion. Most of the Italian's that we encountered, except for the train station in Rome, were friendly and very willing to speak English. You might be very frustrated with the dialup. Also, be sure you have enough RAM to hold this program. I learned that lesson the hard way. It won't download, if there's not enough memory, or whatever is needed. I'm not too proficient with computer stuff. So you may want to consult with a second person. Whatever you decide, have a wonderful time in Italy."
112,open-ended,1617160377,what windows platform is it compatible with?,,I use windows 8 on my laptop. I absolutely LOVE Rosetta Stone. I am learning italian and it is by far the best lesson plan I have EVR had.
113,open-ended,1617160210,How can you easily find a specific lesson to review - even if you 'passed it with 100%'? I am finding this difficult!!,,"When you first start up the program, does your opening screen want to direct you to a specific lesson in a specific unit? Mine does--that's part of setting program preferences. But looking closely at my opening screen, I always see the option to click a link that says ""Explore all activities for Unit x"" When I click that link, I can see all the lessons in the entire unit, and go back to any of them, even the ones in which I performed at 100%. Hope this helps. Let me know if I can help further."
114,open-ended,1617160210,"Does Rosetta Stone start with the Hebrew letters or does it go right into learning the language? If it teaches the letters, how many lessons are spent",,"Rosetta Stone allows the student to learn to speak the language, or to read and speak it, or to read, speak, and write the language. I chose the full package. I already knew the aleph-bet, and how the letters sound. If you don't know the aleph-bet, simply pay attention to the shapes of the letters and listen to the speakers give the phrases, and before long, you will be able to figure out the reading, too. I know this because a friend (years ago) purchased the Rosetta Stone Arabic, and those squiggles are meaningless to me, but after a period I could begin to grasp why a certain squiggle is different than another. It's not like Chinese, where there are hundreds of characters to learn; there are only 22 letters, only a few of which have a different form when found at the end of a word; also one letter takes a different sound based on whether there is a dot over it on one side (shin vs. sin). There are sections where spelling entire sentences is required, and those are the ones that I have the most trouble with. Happily, the program scores my answers, and allows me to retake the lesson till I get a score that is satisfactory to allow me to move on (typically high 80's or the 90's). I cheated and took notes on the correct answers (provided when the section is completed) and took the section again, inputting the correct answers, but wish I had not done that for the first time or two once I found out I would actually learn the words better for having to learn how to spell them. (For example, I spelled it so many times, I'll never forget the Hebrew word for ""toy"" in my life!) Once I learned how valuable the spelling is, I started the program under a different name (several students are allowed, and my wife isn't interested in Hebrew, so they are all me). Once I get to the section with the spelling, I'll take it the honest way, which is to say, by trial and error till I get a good grade."
115,open-ended,1617160210,"I specifically want to learn the Hebrew language for biblical study purposes. Does this program cover, or go into that at all? Thanks!",,"Hello Cornelia, I do not believe it does. The intent of the software appears to be for beginners to be able to converse and write (to some extent)."
116,open-ended,1617160210,"Is the headset/microphone included with the set, or do you need to purchase separately?",,Come With the headset
117,yes/no,1617160210,"Is everyone experiencing this same aggrevation? The part where you repeat, even if you say it right, it marks you wrong!!",N,No
118,yes/no,1617160210,"I saw some packages have audio companion, does this package include audio companion too?",?,"When I saw your question, I went to my original box and opened it. There is a CD that is entitled Audio Companion, but I never listened to what is on it."
119,yes/no,1617160210,Can the download be used on multiple computers,?,I have installed and run this software on multiple computers.

121,yes/no,1617160210,Does the current version allow using Hebrew on your iPhone and iPad? I'm getting conflicting information.,?,"Sorry, I'm not much help. On the CD box is says it is compatible with MP3 devices, but I don't use it that way. Can you call Customer Support at 877-2239763 and ask?"
122,open-ended,1617160210,"What is the Live Online Lesson like? Is there a limit on how many online lessons I can take, or how often?",,"We did not use the online feature, sorry I have no information."
123,yes/no,1617160857,can you down load rosetta stone to 2 different computer at different locations,?,"Hi Just saw your question. That is all you can do. No more than 2 computers. You can down load it on 2 computers and let up to 10 people then use it, but if like us - a family of four; you can not put it on all four computers for 4 people to use. I contacts Rosetta and no way would they be reasonable and let us download it on our individual computers. So only 2 people could use it at a time, I did try it on my daughters computer, but you cannot access the online programs as she is the registered user on that computer- I am told also that using the online program cost more after 3 months- so using it was not that good. Instead, I found Duolingo it is free and apparently more successful than Rosetta Stone is- there is some plateau- ing but no more than RS. Save your money go to http://www.duolingo.com- I think you'll be just as happy and apply the high cost of Rosetta Stone to your next trip"
124,open-ended,1617160857,What is the difference between the Spanish (Latin America) and Spanish (Spain),,"In Spain certain sentence structures are different and they still use ""vosotros"" which is rarely used in South America although some, such as the Argentinians use ""vos"" instead of tu. Also some slang and other sentence structures vary; even Mexican Spanish uses differ. I've been to almost all Central and South American countries that speak Spanish, Brasil does not, ellos hablan portugues. Double ll in argentina sounds like a Shya sound, not ya, Yo llama ingels . Chileans speak very rapidly. Peruvian Spanish is the clearest, nicest. If you plan to spend time in the Americas go with the Latin America, they will understand you in Spain anyway...Or use the universal language, English."

REC, If you have the Version 3 or Version 4 TOTALe program (with CDs), you can install your program on 2 computers, and have up to 5 learners on each computer. If you need any assistance installing on a second computer, feel free to give our Product Support team a call at (866) 834-6115. I hope this helps!"
126,yes/no,1617160857,Hi. Does Learn Spanish: Rosetta Stone Spanish (Latin America) - Level 1-5 Set come with audio companion CDs,Y,"It does but I strongly recommend you look elsewhere. Headset functionality was a constant issue, precluding interaction with a live coach. feedback and echoing and volume problems persisted.Tech support was unable or unwilling to help. The amount of content received is disproportionate to the high price. I found it a frustrating waste of money."
127,yes/no,1617160857,Do I need to buy the whole set to learn?,Y,I would absolutely say yes! I even purchased the Spanish Instant Immersion because I wanted to have it at my work place and be on the go and make sure that I was learning fast.
128,open-ended,1617160857,What version of Windows will this work?,,"I have Windows 8, and it works perfectly. Not sure what other version of Windows it will work with. I'm sure if you call Rosetta Stone, they will have an answer for you."
129,open-ended,1617160857,How many GB is rosetta stone spanish?,,The Rosetta Stone requires 1 GB of Ram or higher and 600 MB free hard-drive space (PER LEVEL)
130,open-ended,1617160857,I'm hard of hearing would be able to understand the conversations on disc,,You could turn the volume way up if needed. I play mine at a low to medium volume so I think you would be just fine. Hope this may help you out. LRE
131,open-ended,1617160857,"if i have mac and my friend has a pc andn we are splitting the disc set, is it compatible with both or are they seperate versions",,compatible with both
132,open-ended,1617160857,How would I use this with a Samsung Chromebook ?,,You would establish an account with your email address as your user id & password & login once your serial #'s are validated. I use it on my cell phone via chrome. The disks are pretty much worthless.
133,yes/no,1617160822,Do you have to have internet access to use this? We have a computer with Windows XP but no internet. There are 4-5 of us wanting to study togethebe,?,"yes, the box version has a CD-ROM which loads onto your computer. I have used the computer version on my PC a few times and there's little difference from the internet version other than appearance. However, you will not be able to chat online with other learners, or play games online with other learners. You can still play games on the computer version. My version SEEMS to suggest that I can load up to five learners on one version, but I haven't tried. Thus a learner would logon and the program would take the learner to where he/she left off. Each learner can proceed at their own pace (I think.) Four or five learners might replace the online chat feature. Good luck!"
134,yes/no,1617160822,is this the correct choice for mexico,Y,"Yes, or the southwest where so many Spanish-speaking people live and work."
135,open-ended,1617160822,What product should my 21yo use to refresh her Spanish? Hasn't taken it in 2 yrs and has to take college level 2 class to meet a requirement. ugh.,,"I have used Rosetta Stone (pricey), duolingo.com & udemy.com. I think udemy is the best but there's no oral component and it starts off very slow for someone who already knows the basics. If you already speak well, then you could probably skip some and do fine. Duolingo is completely free, but I had trouble with the speaking part. If you don't need this, and are just looking for a review, this would probably be your best bet."
136,yes/no,1617160822,Is there a headset included in the box?,Y,yes
137,yes/no,1617160822,can it be used by more than one person?,?,If they have your login information yes
138,open-ended,1617160822,"I bought both the Spanish and French versions, but can't find either one after installing them. What am I doing wrong?",,Since I don't have your computer in front of me I can't say. The people at Rosetta can and will be able to help you. After installing my version I had to do a system recovery. It took out the program when I did it. The Rosetta folks re-installed it for me on line. They should help you too. The program is often a one time install to prevent it being passed around.
139,open-ended,1617160822,"This version is for people whose native language is English, and who want to learn Spanish, correct?",,Absolutely! It is for English speakers who want to learn Spanish
140,yes/no,1617160822,Can this program be used only with an iPad?,Y,Yes it is much cheaper that way
141,open-ended,1617160822,Would this be good for middle and high school students who are beginners to Spanish?,,Yes
142,open-ended,1617160822,Which Spanish version to choose for high school in USA?,,"I would choose something else. This is an immersion approach and will not follow normal Spanish classes which teach grammar. In addition, I did not like the user graphic interface."
143,open-ended,1617160407,Does the program help with becoming fluent to carry a conversation with locals? Beyond simply phrases?,,"Absolutely....but, you must seek to be as immersed in the language and culture as much as possible. Listen to music, news in Italian (RAI), watch movies and turn off the subtitles, go to Italian restaurants. The program is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it. But, like with all language learning, you must be intense and purposeful. Ciao!"
144,yes/no,1617160407,Do I need a special kind of monitor ?,?,Special monitor isn't needed.
145,open-ended,1617160407,"These are dvds? I don't need to go on internet to use them, do I? I only have slow, dial-up speed now and don't want to pay for high- speed service.",,"Please ensure that your system meets the minimum specification for the DVD install and use. If it is too old a system, it might be too slow to run in your PC. Please look at the specification in the ad or contact Rosetta Stone customer service directly. Merry Christmas!"
146,open-ended,1617160407,"Online Access 1. How much is it to extend your online subscription beyond the 3 month 'trial'? Also, wasn't it supposed to be a 15 month trial? I see reviews from earlier mentioning a 15 month free trial that needs to be activated within a 6-month...",,"1. Ours came with 15 months of online access. I'm not sure why you got only 3. 2. You look on their schedule and pick the earliest available time. Sometimes that's in a day or two, and sometimes it's not until a week or two away. I don't know about doing it more often, since we actually never got around to doing this. 3. I loved the online games, but I rarely played them against other people. As far as I know, you can't speak to the other players. I just remember trying to identify things more quickly by typing their names. Mostly I played on my own. The best one for me involved listening to stories and clicking words as you heard them. The words are arranged in a grid, and you try to make a ""bingo."" I listened to some of the stories over and over during the course of the year, and I definitely got better at parsing what they said. Understanding came even later, but I had to begin with just making sense of this flow of unfamiliar sounds. I'm afraid I can't look up the answers for you. We came across a big downside of the program: you only get two installs for $800. So when you have two hard drive crashes (in the month before we left for Italy -- and then we got a new computer, and *it's* new drive crashed within a week!) you're out of luck. It was very frustrating to suddenly lose our program. Several times while we were in Italy, I thought of times I would have liked to look something up or practice something on RS that came up in a conversation in the real world. But, no, the company was too concerned that we would give it away to all our friends, so we couldn't use it anymore after the computer trouble."
147,open-ended,1617160407,How many computers can the software be loaded on?,,I loaded mine on my main PC and another laptop. I believe this is the maximum allowed.
148,yes/no,1617160407,Is this the latest version?,?,"I speak Spanish and Portuguese and tried to learn Italian with Rosetta Stone. It's very slow and very boring. You won't be able to hold a conversation after these lessons. Try Living Language audio programs that you can get on Amazon. I learned Portuguese with living language and Italian too. I just started the Italian programs and I can at the very least, hold a social conversation in Italian. Also try the Power Italian audio books by Mark Frobose, it's great to listen and repeat for faster learning."
149,open-ended,1617160407,Does your version of rosetta stone Italian the PC?Mac Disc version include a digital download for a new macbook with no disc drive?,,"You can either download the files to your Mac or PC or you can use it on line. You get three months on line for free. If you don't pay extra after that, you have to use your local installation. You are allowed to download the files onto two machines."
150,yes/no,1617160407,We want to purchase Level 1-5. Can we listen to it in the car in the CD player. People refer to DVD. The contents lists CD. Which is it?,?,"No. Two reasons. Restrictive software- you need to work through ""the cloud."" And even if you could, the media is twofold - visual and audio. Try the Living Language series - you can put the files on any device you want and it does not depend on visual feedback."
151,yes/no,1617160407,I see that there is a specific headset they advertise on their website and the guy in these videos used it too. Do you HAVE to use theirs somehow ?,Y,It's just a headset with a mic using a usb connection. any similar device will work.
152,open-ended,1617160407,Can I load Rosetta Stone on Mac and PC? Can this be a download or do I need to purchase the disc?,,"I think the safe answer is to call costumer support, they have been very helpful every time I needed assistance and they have different products for different needs. I my opinion this is the best program for learning any language and I had quite a few."
153,yes/no,1617168718,"Will Learn Chinese: Rosetta Stone Chinese (Mandarin) - Level 1-5 Set, not the download, this work on Mac OS 10.6.8",Y,It should work on Mac OS if you have the Mac version. Write to Rosetta for an answer.
154,open-ended,1617168718,"Is there anything apart from the lesson 1-5 set I need to purchase for the course to work? In other words are their fees for on-line access, and is that needed?",,"Chuck, I do not know. My knowledge of Chinese is dialect heavy(Beijing, Sichuan and Cantonese) and I used it for standardizing my speech to the norm for speaking formally with people. The on-line is for continuing your learning and picking up on vocabulary for any special needs that you might have."
155,open-ended,1617168718,Rosetta stone Chinese Level 1-5: Does it work with Windows 8.1?,,"Yes, it works with 8.1. I switched from 8.0 to 8.1 and RS still works. They have recently sent an update and the program is much better now."
156,yes/no,1617168718,Did you learn Chinese?,Y,Yes
157,yes/no,1617168718,My little kid want to use this sw but she can't read English but Korean. Can I select Korean as guide language for Mandarin when I install the sw ?,?,"The two languages are totally unrelated. Korean is more related to Japanese then Chinese. Korean has borrowed some Chinese words but the grammars and word order of the two languages are totally different. Like Japanese, Korean has an extensive system of verb suffixes and post positions unlike anything in Chinese. Occasionally Chinese characters are seen in Korea but they seemed to be more decorative in nature."
158,yes/no,1617168718,can i transfer rosetta stone cd to a tablet?,N,"I think that you might be able to by loading it onto a computer and then from the computer to your tablet. I don't own a tablet so I'm not 100% sure, hope that helps."
159,yes/no,1617168718,is there a guarantee on product if i have any problems with loading on my laptop windows 7,?,I got my money back when it failed to work. But i am not sure if it is their policy or I just got lucky.
160,yes/no,1617168718,is there a guarantee,?,I've read the other comment sent to me. To answer: I have windows 7 and have absolutely no problems. I can even use my own headset but the one they send it actually really nice. They do have trial versions of Rosetta stone and coupons to make it all cheaper. As long as you buy it from a certified and legitimate retailer I don't think you'll have any problems like I did. I still have it and use it about three times a week to keep my Chinese fresh.
161,yes/no,1617168718,can upload this to my samsung tablet?,?,"I have no idea about that sorry. However, I'm sure Rosetta has a 1-800 number you could call to figure that out. Normally I'd say that since its a computer that you could put it on there, but I have no verifiable proof for a samsung tablet."
162,yes/no,1617160075,I have a basic knowledge of the German language but will be heading to Germany and want to become more fluent. Is this what I need?,Y,"It is good for learning the spoken language, but virtually nothing on grammar. I wish there was written text to go along with the lessons. Having said that, it has made me more confident to speak German. I have all 5 levels and have stalled out on Level II, but plan to resume lessons soon."
163,yes/no,1617160075,Does it teach sentence structure?,?,"The method is repetition of words first, including nouns, verbs, articles of nouns and eventually you put them together and make sentences. Some of it is reading and saying something outloud, some is repeating what the ""teacher"" says, some is identifying the object and picking out the correct one from a group of pictures. It is repeated another way next time. Eventually you have learned verbs, articles and sentences. Pretty amazing effective technique. The best I can do to explain it, but to answer your question, yes, eventually you will learn sentence structure. It is expensive but very well done."
164,open-ended,1617160075,Which dialect is taught?,,From my experience in Germany it leans more towards Northern Dialects.
165,yes/no,1617160075,Can you use this on more than one computer?,Y,"Yes, on at least three devices before the number is frozen."
166,yes/no,1617160075,I was raised in Austria and forgot some language skills. Will this help me? A. Thomas,?,"I am sure it would. If I were you I would start at Level 3 or 4 as 1 & 2 are fairly basic. There is not a lot of grammar - what is there you learn by speaking, but that is the way most of us learned grammar anyway."
167,yes/no,1617160075,"Does the CD version come with ""Audio Companion""? The Download version states the Audio Companion is not included.",Y,YES!
168,open-ended,1617160075,Can I use it with Windows XP or do I need a newer operation system?,,I have no idea. I use windows 8.1.
169,yes/no,1617160075,Does the software for german levels 1-5 include a microfone,Y,Yes.
170,yes/no,1617160075,Will this work on an Apple Macbook?,Y,Yes... Works on my Mac
171,yes/no,1617160075,Is this truly version 4 as shown in the picture?,Y,Yes
172,open-ended,1617160482,How important is it to buy additional books just as Hiragana and Katagana?,,"If you want to read and write (and you do), you need comfort with the alphabets. Romanized versions are, in my opinion, a disservice. My wife read many children's books in Hiragana after mastering the basics."
173,yes/no,1617160482,Does the software completely quit working after the 3 month subscription is up?,N,"No, the 3 month subscription is just to the online stuff. You have your software on your computer forever and you do not have to continue the online subscription."
174,yes/no,1617160482,can this run on windows 8?,Y,"Yes, it can run on windows 8. Thats what my computer is. If you really want this, I recommend getting it very much."
175,open-ended,1617160482,How well does it work for elementary school age?,,"I think it could work, but it would depend highly on the mental age of the child; if you're coming from a non-pictograph language, the first problem you will have is that you hear a lot of sounds but no distinct words and following along with the printed text doesn't help because you can't read it. I found I was really struggling with Rosetta Stone until I took a few days to learn both Hiragana and Katakana phonetic writing systems (46 characters each, but the sounds are the same). Once I did that, the whole thing made complete sense because I could match up what I was hearing with what I was seeing. Japanese as a whole is not an overly complex language; it doesn't have a lot of exceptions to the rule, but there are some significant differences with a language such as English. Before you spend this kind of money on something a child may or may not stick with, I would strongly suggest using the web to see how they take to learning Hiragana and Katakana. There are some excellent apps out there for iOS (Dr Moku's Hiragana and Katakana apps, for example)."
176,yes/no,1617160482,"Is the physical box just a CD? I'm on a macbook air that has no CD drive. Seems like it has something else too, but no value if can't install.",?,I bought mine over 2 years ago but it contained cd's
177,open-ended,1617160482,"The rosetta stone website has levels 1-3 for $209. Is this cheaper because it's an older edition? If so, anyone know if there's a major difference?",,"I don't think it matters, it updates to current programs setting (all my language installments have been changing/updating for years). I think it updates the lessons too, because when I check my status I find I have things I didn't due after an update."
178,yes/no,1617160482,does it come with the headphone/ headset?,?,"I purchased mine six years ago, and it did not come with a head set."
179,yes/no,1617160482,Will this work on OS X Yosemite,?,"I think so. I used it lion. There is a better program for only $30 on Amazon. It has a couple dvds and books. I think it is called ""living language Japanese"""

The only thing that expires is the online feature which you can continue for a fee. Within the last 6 months I downloaded the APP for free for my Samsung galaxy S3 and my iPad. Using my original sign-in information, I'm able to use Rosetta Stone on my home PC, on my handheld devices, and remotely on other computers! It's awesome! I find I use the phone app most often when I'm waiting."
183,open-ended,1617160946,How many devices can this be installed on?,,You can only install it on one device to be able to get all the lesson. If you try to install it on another device you will only get some if the lessons. I would recommend the online option that allows you to access it from different devices and you get more features.
184,open-ended,1617160946,how many computers can I install this on?,,If I recall the license allows 2 installations but read it carefully bc if you need to reinstall on an existing computer that would use up the other installation. We load all our languages on one computer for that reason

192,open-ended,1935341049,Is this a subscription for a year or a permanent purchase?,,"I bought the software with support for a year. The support finished but I could still use the software in its current format. However, I like Smart Draw so much I got an upgrade to take advantage of its improvements."
193,open-ended,1935341049,When I try to plot map points from an Excel spreadsheet it skips a couple each time. Anyone know why? I cant find a pattern to any of the points it skips. I thought it might have been because it didn't recognize the address points I was entering but...,,"You should contact SmartDraw tech support. They are pretty responsive.

194,yes/no,1935341049,Is this useful in banquet planning and layout?,?,"Jennifer, I would think it would be handy for banquet planning and layout. They have templates for everything, including rectangles, round tables, chairs, etc. that you can make to the size you need. You can duplicate the walls, wall openings, doorways, etc, so you get good traffic flow. It's not hard to use, and if you run into problems, call the help line and they walk you through. Good Luck, Brooke"
195,yes/no,1935341049,Can you use it for something like drawing a planned house addition to an existing house?,?,"Smartdraw provides you with the capability to create ""clean sheet"" house plans as well as drawings to support additions to existing structures. If you are creating an addition you will need to create an existing conditions plan that captures the current structure components, and will form the basis for the addition plans. Your local building governance codes will likely require that you capture existing conditions prior to the issuance of the building permit for the addition. Depending on the covenants that may be in force in your neighbourhood, a detailed floor plan and elevation will likely be all you need for job permitting on an addition. Smartdraw provides you with easy to use template to address both of these design challenges, and the software is intuitive, and easy to use. I am in the building business and can not tell how much money I would have saved on draftsman fees if I had known about Smartdraw....good luck with the addition....."

I have all the master cook cd's, downloaded all of them to fix there many mistakes and/or creator. I switched over to a new site called COOK'n and they are on version 11. Much better program than master cook who I think let the update's go. They were focused on there games which brings in more monies. COOK'n is far better program, but has it's problem's. They do take your questions, suggestions and work on the fixes. I have emailed master cook many times and never received a response from them. Good luck"

244,open-ended,B00002S9SH,What year was family tree maker version 1.0 released?,,I found first version of family tree maker in early 1980s; was in Germany but had to take trip back to the states for business; stopped by at one of the little shops in pentagon and spotted the FTM disc and decided to give it a try. It was very helpful.

You can sign up to use Ancestry, do you tree and research there in the same format as FTM and ignore the FTM on your computer. Every once in a while I go through the process of downloading all the changes i make on line to the FTM program on my computer. I just got a new computer, and I have not yet loaded FTM on it, but I still go the ancestry.com and do all my work there....I'll get around to downloading all the changes at some point."

255,yes/no,B00002SANH,One of the reviewers mentioned having prostitutes at the end of the game. I am looking to buy this for my grandchildren. Are there prostitutes?,Y,"I've been playing this game for over fifteen years and I have never come across a single prostitute. It could be a typo, you can prospect for gold if you take the 'Sacramento Trail'. Maybe he meant 'prospectors'. I think it's a good idea that you are buying this game for your grandchildren. Just be sure that they have a computer that can run it. I played it on ""Windows 95"" in my youth but it works with my ""Windows XP"" laptop. Any newer Windows OS probably won't run it. You could try stuff like 'Doss Box' but that is a route that you probably don't want to take because of all the complex computer work. You could take the computer to a microsoft store but that could end up costing hundreds of dollars and even then, it's not guaranteed to work. But if you do have the proper computer hardware, ""Oregon Trail 2"" is the best version of the ""Oregon Trail"" series."
256,yes/no,B00002SANH,"Will this version work with a Windows XP, 3.3 GHz, 1.98 GB of Ram?",Y,It should. If you have a 32 bit version of windows Xp should work out of the box. If you have the 64 bit version you will need to manually install it but it will work fine too.
257,open-ended,B00002SANH,How many discs does this software have? Do new discs need to be inserted to go on in the game?,,"There is just one disc, so no need to change anything during the game.

258,open-ended,B00002SANH,This game will not install because I have a 64 bit processor and this game is for a 32 bit processor only. How can I install this game on my computer?,,You can't. This program is for much older computer and won't install on newer models. I had the same issue.
259,yes/no,B00002SANH,will this work on newer computer like 8.1?,?,"No it won't, not out of the box. There is a work around that you can look up online though, after that it runs fine. I've done the modification myself and it works with my windows 8.1 64bit laptop."

265,yes/no,B00004UCUS,Will this software work on windows 7?,Y,"If I'm not mistaken, it will depend upon if you're running 32 bit or 64 bit Windows 7. The Pajama Sam game, along with the other Humongous Entertainment games of its time, runs in 16-bit. Windows operating systems are able to emulate back one generation, so 32-bit can emulate 16-bit, but 64-bit can only emulate as far back as 32-bit. So, if you're running 32-bit Windows 7, you'll be able to run the game just fine off the disc. If you're running 64-bit Windows 7 (or any Windows OS), the game will not natively run off the disc. That said, there are work arounds available. There's a program called ScummVM. If you get the game, you can pull certain files off the CD, and this program allows you to run the game, even on a 64-bit system. For more info on that program, visit http://scummvm.org/ Hope this helps. Enjoy!"

271,open-ended,B00004UF32,Can anyone tell me if this software will works with windows eight-Thank you,,"The game will not work on Windows 7 or Windows 8 directly, but there is a work that doesn't require you to be an IT pro to perform. You can go to www.microsoft.com and download Windows XP mode, and the required Windows Virtual Server for free. After installing both of those, you can run Clue Finder's 4th Grade and many other educational titles for Windows XP without any problems. I will post the links for the downloads as well."
272,yes/no,B00004UF32,will this product work windows 8 operating system?,?,"I can't be certain, but it never worked with later Windows versions. Even when we used the ""wizard"" that is supposed to make it work with later versions. I would not count on it."
273,yes/no,B00004UF32,Will this one work on windows 7?,?,"I don't know for sure, but I doubt it. When new operating systems came along, we had trouble using it - did not get it to work. That was ages ago, so I would guess it won't work now. My then 4th grader is now a sophomore in college."

296,yes/no,B00005A9VI,I use Quicken and TurboTax. Does MoneyDance work with TurboTax?,?,"Turbotax won't import Moneydance data. Moneydance will export QIF and tab delimited but those won't go into Turbotax. I also use Turbotax. I just enter in the data manually. Years ago, I used quicken and did the import thing. I then had to double check and fix up. I think the manual method is actually faster and more reliable at the end of the day. Every year, I tell myself I'm going to try one of the other tax programs but then time runs short and I fall back on Turbotax. Maybe this year."
297,open-ended,B00005A9VI,"Why does it take at least one whole minute to move from line to line, and in general so so slow as to be unusable?",,I don't have that problem. Mine is quick. Ask on the help line.

However, you get a registration number, which would allow you to re-download, if needed. Also, I have found Infinite Kind support to be extremely helpful and responsive. I sent several emails early on, and each was responded to. Good luck. It's not Quicken, but I really love it."
301,yes/no,B00005A9VI,can I import msm money onto moneydance,Y,"Not directly. The way I got my data into Moneydance was to import it into Quicken and then export it as a QIF file. If Microsoft Money supports QIF output you could export directly. Although I really like Moneydance, I'd gladly go back to Microsoft Money if I had the opportunity. Money was an absolutely perfect fit for my needs while Moneydance is just very well designed for my needs."
302,yes/no,B00005A9VI,Will it work for property management?,?,"That depends on what you are trying to get the software to do. If you are asking whether it can handle basic asset reporting and accounting, the answer is yes. If you are trying to get it to print invoices or do credit checks or any other specialized property management functions; sorry, the answer is no."
303,yes/no,B00005A9VI,does money allow using envelopes for monthly income and expense,?,Not exactly in the sense you mean. It has a fairly extensive budgeting function but I've never used it so I can't vouch for it. All I can say from experience is that the program has worked very well for my needs except for a couple of minor nagging issues that I really should contact the vendor about as there is probably a solution already out there.

318,open-ended,B00005AFI0,Can this be installed on a CLEAN HARD DRIVE or does it require an existing operating system!,,"I'm not sure, but I believe it needs and operating system to function correctly. Google the system requirements and that should tell you. hope this helps."

320,yes/no,B00005AFI0,will this Office XP work on my laptop windows Vista,N,I do not know. This is a pretty old product. I would suggest to find a more recent version.
321,open-ended,B00005AFI0,Is it possible to reinstall this on another computer if the original computer gets damaged or is sold? Or is the license tied to one computer?,,As long as you have the original disk that has not been overwritten you should be able to install it on other computers. I did.

382,open-ended,B00005MOTG,HOW MANY PRODUCT KEYS ARE INCLUDED? CAN SOME ONE TELL ME IF IT IS?,,"Yes, there is one (1) product key included."
383,yes/no,B00005MOTG,"I want to get a windows XP partition for my macbook pro (with disc drive), do I need to buy a starting operating system before this upgrade?",Y,Yes. You will need an OS to start with first so that could upgrade.
384,yes/no,B00005MOTG,can i install this on a desktop. even tho it has no operating system installed,?,"No. An ""upgrade"" version requires a previous version to be existing (or at least have the installation disk(s) for the previous version). That said, XP is no longer supported and is vunerable to security attacks. MS is providing no further updates (as of April 2014). But if ou must have XP, then look for the ""Full"" version."
385,open-ended,B00005MOTG,I have a genuine MS Windows XP Home and would like to upgrade it to Windows XP Professional. Is it OK or it's any for 95 or ME?,,I did upgraded from 95 or ME to XP home.
386,yes/no,B00005MOTG,Can I use this to upgrade XP Home Edition to XP Pro?,Y,yes
387,open-ended,B00005MOTG,Using this Upgrade XP How does it ask for a previous install? Do you have to install Win 98 first or just have a Win 98 disk handy?,,"In my experience, you need only have an OEM Microsoft install disc to validate using the upgrade. It will ask you to insert it during install, and after checking the OEM, it will resume XP installation."
388,open-ended,B00005MOTG,on my windows 8 what program will i need to play window 2000 xp games,,It depends on the game. Hit Google for help.
389,yes/no,B00005MOTG,will this program work on a windows 8 hp ladtop,?,"In short, No. It won't allow you to install it over a newer operating system, and since this is an upgrade disk, you can't do a clean install or even a dual boot install with this disk (unless you have a full version disk for an older operating system)."
390,yes/no,B00005MOTG,"As of today April 14, 2014, Microsoft has already stopped its support for WinXP, can I still activate the software if I buy this version?",Y,"Yes. A Microsoft spokesperson stated that ""Windows XP can still be installed and activated after end of support on April 8[, 2014]""."
391,yes/no,B00005MOTG,"As of April 14, 2014, Microsoft has stopped its support for WinXP, can I still activate the software if I buy this version?",Y,"As far as I know, yes. Support refers mainly to things like Windows Security Essentials, various updates, and framework stuff. As I understand it (switched before the change), Windows XP still technically works, but because all the windows support software is gone, there's alot of backdoors and cracks in security. It might work, but right now is a pretty scary time to buy."
392,yes/no,B00005MOTE,Can I install this on a Dell Latitude D630 with Linux and Ubuntu?,?,"First to clarify the question. Ubuntu is a sort of Linux. Here is some details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions To add windows to it, here is the knowhow: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot"

395,yes/no,B00005MOTE,does this come with drivers,Y,this one is very missleading it is nothing more than an upgrade from windows 98 t xp if you allready have an xp this will not work if you have a computer with win 98 then you be fine but all by it self ya got nothin sadly im gladi didnt spend great deal of money on it
396,open-ended,B00005MOTE,"I have a Toshiba satellite lap top with windows 8, it is 64 bit. will this work? and does it have product key?",,it does come with a product key and I believe up to 3 or 4 people can use it.

Can i instal without additional disks,Y,I don't know if it will work my thought is call staples or best buy and ask them what I know is you should have xp orginal before you upgrade hope this helps
399,open-ended,B00005MOTE,I have three computers that have XP do I need to buy three dics,,"XP will only support one computer now in 2014,and it used to support three computers until I think it became expensive to police those computer with regards to hackers and probably three times the amount of updates. You need a home network or homegroup, you still can't run online at anytime. The support is ending in XP(they always seem to reissue or keep up somehow) and all future Windows is yes buy three disks or a volume license."
400,yes/no,B00005MOTE,Does it come with a product key,Y,Yes
401,open-ended,B000063EMX,I lost everything in a fire. Someone got me version 5 limited edition. Do you know if I can jump (upgrade) from that to 7? (I'm on a used XP),,"Yes, you can. Simply put, yes. I used to have an XP. It does work on it. 7 is old, It will even work on windows 2000. Which I also, had where it worked. So yes, go right ahead and upgrade to 7."
402,open-ended,B000063EMX,What do you mean by [ Old Version ] ?,,"Hi! It means there is a more recent edition available, but this one is still fully functional. This one is the 7.0 upgrade which was first available in 2002. The platforms it called for when originally produced were Windows NT / 98 / 2000 / Me / XP / 95. I believe it's the last one they made before it became the CD versions. I don't know a lot more about it than that unfortunately. The copy I am offering is brand new - still shrinkwrapped. I hope this answers your questions."
403,open-ended,B000063EMX,I have Photoshop 5.5 and 6 upgrade on my PC will this upgrade work with Win 8.1. It is worth upgrading?,,It probably will NOT work with your 64 bit system..Do yourself a BIG favor and subscribe to Adobe Photoshop CC for Photographers for like $10/moneh..You cant beat it..It's the BEST bargain available..Find it to download on adobe.com. Eddie
404,yes/no,B000063EMX,Do you have to have some sort of photoshop on your PC in order to use this?,Y,"Yes, it searches your system plus it asks for serial number of earlier version."
405,yes/no,B000063EMX,Is it compatible with Windows 8?,?,"No - Windows 8 takes you out of contents, ( you loose direction in trying to perform a simple task ) - that was so easy - when working with Windows 7."

Is there one that will?,Y,"I also used CreateaCard for many years and haven't found a way to use it with ""7."" I am now using Printmaster Platinum 18. It's really close to CreateaCard except the graphics aren't quite as good, (just my opinion). The best part of Printmaster is that you don't have to learn a new program. Good Luck!"
407,yes/no,B000066EU1,Is there an American Greetings Creatacard program that will run on Windows 8,?,I have Windows 8 and it runs for me. I am not able to get card designs from the web on Windows 8. I should try it on my laptop which is a Vista program.

I have looked far and wide to purchase it and have had no luck finding even one. To answer your question ""Will it work on a Mac?"" I believe it will if your Mac has Window's, and if that Window's is Window's 7, or older. I'm not real famillar with Mac, but I do know this version will work, as I said, on Window's 7 or older. I'd love to know where you found this product if you are able to respond to me. Good Luck, It is truly a great program, you can create extraordinary work with ease. Adrienne Gould"

434,yes/no,B00006ANW9,Will photoshop elements 2.0 be able to download and operate as I am now using Ubuntu since XP died.,?,"XP died? Funny. It's still alive on one of my machines. It's no longer being supported, but that is not the same as being dead. Photoshop Elements 2.0 had not been supported by Adobe for over a year now, but it is not dead either. In fact, I am using it on my Windows 7 machine. It looks for but doesn't find the mother machine for updates, but it also is still working. I have not tried to install it on a Unix machine (I also have one with Ubuntu interface), but now that you mention it, I probably ought to try it and see what happens."

I had it installed on my older computer that was 64bit Win 7 But to be honest it has been so long I do not remember if I had to do anything to make it work. Win 7 is very forgiving unlike that monster Vista. Worst case it wont work but if it doesn't download the FREE Gimp program which will do anything you could want with photos.
439,yes/no,B00006ANW9,Is this compatible with Windows vista,?,I don't know. Contact Adobe

443,yes/no,B00006ELM9,Does it run on Windows 8 ?,Y,"Yes... Currently running it right now on Windows 8. I believe we are running it in XP compatibility mode.

The emulator just gives me back my start menu and multiple windows on screen, but it's still Windows 8."

445,open-ended,B00006ELM9,Windows 7: Has anyone tried Liberty's Kids with Windows 7?,,I just bought and installed this program.

I was able to run the program no problem after doing this. I found the answer to the problem here: http://www.fixya.com/support/t10514728-pc_game_liberty_kids_played_windows.

If your Mac originally came with a version of 10.3 or higher, you will not be able to install 10.2. If the Mac originally shipped with 10.2 or lower, then yes, you can erase the OS and install 10.2.

I use it in Win7 without any problems in normal use, but it notifies you during installation of certain limitations with some database features (crosstabs, I think). I have encountered some problems with cutting and pasting text from certain webpages, which I then turn to Open Office instead. Overall, however, word processing and spreadsheet work is all I need and 95% of the time it is ideal."

479,open-ended,B00007E6Y5,Will all included products install on Windows 7? Which version of Lotus Org is in the Suite?,,"As far as I can tell, all components will install on Windows 7, but since I only use Word Pro, 123 and Approach, I can not tell you which other components work properly in Windows 7. I know there will be some limitations in Approach, which already had some issues in XP. For my purposes, however, Approach is fine. Word Pro and 123 work great and don't seem to have any limitations. Unless someone else knows better, I wouldn't use the Fastsite or Smart Center components, they're already so dated."

602,open-ended,B0001WN1A8,Catalan spell check issues: Does anyone know how I can get this function to work properly?,,"Hey, I realize this is kind of a late response, but I think the issue you're having is that Office doesn't actually come with the spell/grammar checking support for a lot of the languages it ""supports."" With the version of office 2003 I use, only english gets grammar, and only english, spanish, french, and i imagine a couple others get spell checking. Otherwise, it's really just there for the sake of being there. I think you can buy an add-on to check it for you, but I don't know how well it works. Also, at least for email or web posts, mozilla has a free catalan dictionary that will check spelling inside their firfox browser or thunderbird email client (all are free). Good luck w/ the catal :) - Gordon"

625,open-ended,B00020SEYM,Do powerpoints and text show up clearly? Would you recommend this for classroom use?,,"Personally I rarely use it for text because the resolution is low. For instance when it shows my desktop, I can barely read the file names. For a Powerpoint presentation this may not be an issue as long as the font size is large enough.

632,open-ended,B00022PTI4,"is this the Full Retail, or is this OEM?",,"Hello yes this is a full version, keep in mind that XP end of service is April 2014. This means that Microsoft will not be making any updates for it, or giving customer support for XP. You will still be able to use it as a base system, to use a upgrade version of windows 7 and 8. Hope this was helpful to you."
633,open-ended,B00022PTI4,is this a 32 or 64 bit,,"This is 32 bit, if it were the 64 bit version that would be indicated (possibly as ""X64"")"
634,open-ended,B00022PTI4,Will I be able to downgrade a new windows 8 computer to this version of windows XP? What wil be necessary? What new machines can I use to do this?,,"Albert, don't downgrade windows 8 on your windows xp version. Window xp will be stopped in circulation soon.

635,open-ended,B00022PTI4,Installing on a Mac: Is that what this is?,,"Yeah, like anybody would want to mess around with Vista. LOL Have fun with your XP (and yeah, like you said, it does come on one disk)."
636,open-ended,B00022PTI4,Quick question... ...why in hell is this still so expensive?,,If you are building a sytem from scratch get the OEM version it is cheaper.
637,open-ended,B00022PTI4,"windows xp pro - used: How is it possible to buy a ""used"" copy of xp and have it work if it can only be installed on one computer?",,"I bought a new PC recently - my old motherboard finally gave up and died. I installed my copy of XP on it and it activated with no problemo. I do not think that it really prevents you from installing on other PCs but I do not know if the limit to installs is based on timeframe e.g. twice a year, or your computer hardware ids. XP can't be too restrictive otherwise ppl would not be able to upgrade hardware and their customer base would be more 'annoyed' than usual. Check out this link - NellyE says the limit is once every 4 months http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090910100643AAVFf6q"
638,open-ended,B00022PTI4,Is the 32 or 64 bits?,,32 bit.. I haven't used the 64 bit version.
639,open-ended,B00022PTRU,"Is this usable to install in a brand new hard drive? or does it require a previous Windows 98 ,for example,be on the hard drive already? thank you",,"This is the full version, so you don't need a previous version already on the hard drive."
640,yes/no,B00022PTRU,I currently have a laptop with Windows 8. I hate it! Can I install Windows XP with SP2 over this system?,Y,"Don't try having both OSs at once. My suggestion is to decant all your apps and files to an external ""save drive, and install XP. If it looks like the Windows 8 is still there, you didn't do it right and you (or somebody who know how to ""kill"" Windows 8) will have to do it again. That said, yes. XP with SP2 is a going proposition. Microsoft is many patches ""ahead"" of plain-vanilla SP2, so caution..."
641,open-ended,B00022PTRU,Installing Windows XP: or should i have a professional do it?,,Thanks for your help. I think I will stick with XP. I have found Vist media center a nightmare.
642,yes/no,B00022PTRU,"did your copy of XP come with all necessary drivers and internet ready, ie., fully operational",Y,Yes
643,open-ended,B00022PTRU,is this 1 32 or 64 bit,,"Look on your computer to determine if ""it"" is 32 or 64. Research of Windows XP states requirements for installation, and it recommends PC with 300 MHz processor 233 MHz minimum. 128 MB of RAM or higher recommended (64 MB min. support, etc.........requirements vary based on your particular pc and what is installed. I replaced my XP software because of what I was using it for. It is not for internet or browsing, but used in my sewing room for my embroidery machine software. It is older and wasn't compatible with the newer Windows products. To upgrade my particular sewing software was going to cost upwards of $1,000.00 + so I chose to try and find XP. This was the suggestion of a Computer Tech, and was happy to be able to find the package. Microsoft upgrades but they don't think about people that have other uses for their computers other than internet, surfing, etc Hope this helps, but if you aren't knowledgeable about this stuff like me, seek help from the professionals that is what I did."
644,open-ended,B00022PTRU,I bought a new computer with windows 8 already installed and I hate it. Had xp on last computer and no problems til computer died. So guess my ? is can I uninstall 8 and install xp home w/ sp2 full version successfully?,,Sure! I don't see why not
645,open-ended,B00022PTRU,cd-rom bootable? Does anyone know if I could boot and install XP from solely the CD?,,"You can install directly from the CD. To install an upgrade Window must detect a existing installation. You new hard drive, I'm guessing, doesn't have an existing installation. So an upgrade won't work."
646,open-ended,B00022PTRU,"OEM or FULL RETAIL? Is this the version that can be moved to other computers, or is it OEM?",,"OEM stands for ""original equipment manufacturer."" This kind WILL NOT WORK with Parallels for Mac. I made this mistake: bought parallels, didn't do my homework, bought an OEM version of XP on ebay, and now I'm out the $80 I paid for it. I'm back on here right now trying to make sure I get a FULL - NON OEM version I can actually use for parallels mac. On the other hand, if you're just running a PC and you just need an Operating System (OS) my understanding is that an OEM version of Windows will work just fine. I'm certain an OEM version will be perfect for those building their own systems."
647,yes/no,B00022PTRU,Will this install over my XP original version with no SPaks? I have Mac/Parallels.,Y,Yes it will!
648,yes/no,B0002423YK,"Does this include SP1, as well as SP2 upgrade?",?,"No. You can get the upgrades from Micro$oft when you register your product, but the Home version is limited. Read the info carefully before you buy it, because Amazon doesn't accept returns (at least it wouldn't accept mine). As with everything, know what you are ordering."
649,open-ended,B0002423YK,Is this OEM or the full version of XP,,"It did not include other Microsoft products that I had to buy separately, and it was not returnable, despite of Amazon's assurances. Be very, very careful if you choose this item."
650,yes/no,B0002423YK,"Mac with Intel: Unfortunelty it must be installed in order to run a few windows applications that I would like (Outlook), I really dont need all the features that XP or vista offer, i just want to run Outlook and a few other programs...Will this work?",Y,"you should use xp. xp is the best option because it is tried-and-true. also, this is the best option, because parallels (the other option) cost zillions, and don't work as well. just remember to get good antivirus software (even free ones are ok), because now you are using windows :P"
651,yes/no,B0002423YK,Is this the new update that i heard on the news tonight about that everyone has to have to keep Windows XP working?,?,"This is the program components to restore XP to your computer after a crash or to update it if you do not have service pack 2. Microsoft is not going to any version of XP so no upgrade is going to help. It will keep working, but no updates will be available for XP."
652,yes/no,B000266786,Will this cd play in the car cd player?,?,"Hi, No, you need to play it on a pc or laptop or tablet with a Windows or Macintosh operating system. Thanks for asking."
653,open-ended,B000266786,I have windows 7 will this game work with that?,,yes it will but not mac computers and I cant use the one I bought .
654,yes/no,B000266786,Does these work on Ipad,N,"No, this does not work on iPad. It is a CD-ROM. You may be able to find similar/comparable apps on the App Store. Some Phonics/reading apps we like are Montessori Crosswords, Super Why and Meme tales. They are all under $5 and align with preschool/ kindergarten common core language arts standards."
655,yes/no,B000266786,will this run ok on windows 8?,Y,I couldnt get it to run on my windows 7...kept freezing and locking up the computer. Don't know if I had a defective disc or what but I ended up sending mine back.
656,yes/no,B000266786,Will it run on OSX 10.6 without classic?,?,I can't get Reader Rabbit to run on my windows computers XP or later. I don't know what OSX is. I am disappointed because my children loved reader rabbit and my grandson did too.
657,yes/no,B000266786,"Will this work with a mac, specifically OS X version 10?",?,No. It doesn't even work on newer Windows 7 or 8. Don't buy this crap.

661,open-ended,B000266786,Does it run on Windows 7 or 8?,,"No... it's a great product, but it doesn't run on Windows 7 or 8. You'll need an older Windows XP to run it. I wish the publisher would revamp it for the newer OS."
662,yes/no,B00029BPMG,Does it work with windows 8,Y,"I haven't used it much, but it downloaded, opened, etc. w/ Windows 8."

This is a very good program and I use it all the time. I have nothing negative."
673,yes/no,B0002BQMA4,Is this the latest version of this talking dictionary?,?,"I'm not sure. Some versions of these talking dictionaries are not compatiable with the latest computer programs. I love mine that I use with my Windows 7. (I've had it for years, even used it with XP.) I tried to use it with Windows 8 and it was incompatiable. This one (which I bought) may or may not be compatiable with your program. I think you could possibly research this version to find out what programs allow it to operate properly."
674,open-ended,B0002BQMA4,What do I need that will work in windows 7,,I was unsuccessful in my attempts to run the program. My research indicated that further efforts would be equally as futile. Additionally I have not been able to locate a talking dictionary anywhere that will work on windows 7.
675,yes/no,B0002BQMA4,does this product do anagram searches?,N,"No, it does not do Anagram searches, but it does everything else, there are times that I need the pronunciation of a word, you can choose any word in the dictionary response, and it will give you the definition. Hope that this helps you."

I emailed them and asked for support but never received a reply. So, I bought EZ Home & Office Address Book Plus, installed it and have no problems. EZ Home & Office emailed me, thanking me for buying it and told me that they offer lifetime support. I have taken them up on it once the first week and found them extremely helpful. Sorry I can't help you, but would suggest you get rid of My Mail List and get one that works."
679,open-ended,B0002BQQTQ,How do I change the label from Nebs to Avery? I am trying to do return address labels but Nebs comes up and I am using Avery labels,,"I cannot answer your question because I uninstalled My Mail List & Address Book after being unable to get support from Avanquest for any issue.

680,yes/no,B0002BQQTQ,Can I use this program with Windows 7?,Y,"Even tho My Mail List was designed for Windows 98 and Windows xp, it works great on Windows 7. I was very happy about this because I had used it on our old xp for years."

I tried loading it several times with the same result. have no clue what is happening. I was going to send it back but that would cost almost as much as it's worth so I just chalked ut up as a learning experience. sorry I couldn't be of more help, John"
683,yes/no,B0002BQQTQ,will my address book work with windows 8,Y,There is NO support for My MailList. I doubt it will work will with anything new. I went to another program (StatTrak Address Manager) and the export/import of information was good.

For best results, you may be able to find iMac G4 discs on eBay--but, again, these should work fine. And, finally, as an extra tip, if you can, see if you can try Leopard instead. It's more modern and better supported by older apps. And, since you're a 4,2 and not a 6,1 model, you may need to either install 10.5 through FireWire or over clock your G4 speed.

769,yes/no,B0002W2UMW,Can I create vector files with this?,?,"Hello Jolene, I copied this from the Paint Shop Pro 9 ""Help"" section: About Raster and Vector Graphics Computer graphics are of two types: raster (also called bitmap) or vector. With Paint Shop Pro, you create both raster and vector images. You can also create an image with both raster and vector layers. It's important to understand the differences between the two data types. Raster Images Raster images are composed of individual elements, called pixels, arranged in a grid. Each pixel has a specific location and color. If you magnify raster data, you can see the individual pixels as squares of colors. An object in a raster image is defined by its pixels. For example, the front door in an image of a house is made up of a mosaic of pixels at certain locations in the image. In bitmap images you edit pixels rather than objects or shapes. Raster images can display subtle changes in tones and colors, so they are most often used for images like photographs and digital artwork. Raster images contain a fixed number of pixels, so when you magnify the image you are magnifying the display size of the pixels. As a result, raster images can display jagged rather than smooth edges if magnified on screen or printed at a large magnification. Vector Graphics Vector graphics or images use geometric characteristics-lines, curves, and their locations-to define objects. For example, a door in a graphic of a house is made up of a rectangle with a certain width and height at a specific location and filled with a certain color. In vector images you edit objects or shapes rather than pixels. Vector graphics do not lose clarity or detail when scaled to any size or printed at any resolution. They work well for technical illustrations or corporate logos. Choosing Raster or Vector In Paint Shop Pro, you create and edit raster and vector data on separate layers. With some tools you create raster data (like brush strokes with the Paint tool) and with other tools (like the Text and Preset Shapes tools) you can choose whether you want to create raster or vector data. In general, use vector objects when you'll need to edit the object as an element separate from other parts of the image. For example, if you add a star to an image, you may want to change its size, color or location. This is easier if the star is a vector object. You can create raster data on separate layers so you can easily edit or move them. To apply tools or commands to vector objects that work only on raster data (such as the painting tools or the effects commands), you can create a raster selection of a vector object. Then, paste the selection to a new raster layer.

776,yes/no,B0002Z9TGO,I will be getting a new computer in the near future. Will this work with my old worksheets?,Y,"The real question is whether the new lotus will work with Windows 7 or 8. I couldn't make it work on 7 unless I went to Virtual XP. Some others have had a better experience. I finally gave up and moved to Excel--but the new excel is NO LONGER compatible with Lotus. So my advice, if you have lots of Lotus spreadsheets wouldbe, if you can to use the older Lotus version you now have. I made the switch because I am disenchanted with Lotus' unwillingness to make themselves compatible, and to me, prefer leave the field to Microsoft."
777,yes/no,B0002Z9TGO,will it work with windows 8?,?,According to the IBM website (Look up Lotus SmartSuite 9.8.2 Support Questions) - yes. We are installing it on a 2008 R2 64 bit server and it appears to be working correctly.

786,open-ended,B0006HHI3E,yourself fitness: can you use this on your dvd player?,,"No, there's no standard video DVD for it. It's too customized and complex of a program to run in a DVD player. It exists for PC, Play Station 2, xbox (the old one, but I think the new one might play it), and for the Wii under a different name. These are the only formats I'm aware of, and I've done quite a bit of research. I personally own the PC and Wii versions."

790,yes/no,B0006I74UK,Will this work with Windows 8?,Y,Yes mine does! Great program and company!
791,yes/no,B0006I74UK,Will 4.0 work on windows 7?,Y,System requirements for this product are windows 95/98/Me/2000/xp. I have installed it into my computer that has windows xp. The web site for this product is www.hobbyware.com

You can customize all of the details of your patterns!! All the way from the type of stitches stitches (can choose to not do any 1/2 or 1/4 stitches, and also can select if you want backstitching), you choose the size, tell it which size fabric you are using, and can also customize to the amount of colors you want to work with... I work on large projects always and this program is perfect for me making my own patterns!!"
793,open-ended,B0006I74UK,"Curious... you just scan in an image, and the program can figure out the color threads needed as well? The just print out the pattern to follow?",,Yes and you can also choose how many colors you want to use to give it more detail. Up to over 100
794,yes/no,B0006I74UK,Was wondering if when you use this program does it recommend the DMC you should use based on the picture?,?,It recommends the DMC and how many of each one.
795,open-ended,B0006I74UK,"What is the difference between this and the ""Professional"" version? Is it worth paying almost triple the cost for the Pro version of this same software?",,"The pro version has the machine option; and a library of some patterns (Donna Vermillion Giampa; Kooler Design Studio). If you are a regular stitcher (rather than a teacher or a designer), the regular program will do everything you want! mb"
796,yes/no,B0006I74UK,Can you use this program to make a PDF file? I am thinking of using it to create designs to sell.,Y,"Yes, you can: select the virtual printer on your computer when your design is ready, and print to pdf in stead of paper."
797,yes/no,B0006I74UK,Is this an effective software for creating patterns using a variety of fonts?,N,"The software can handle any font that you need. There is not just one font. If you are looking to make your patterns and have a font in mind, this is still the best cross-stitch software."
798,yes/no,B0006I74UK,will it create the pattern in word format as well as chart?,?,"I just searched the index and found this: ""The Page Layout can be exported as a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. This allows the layout to be further edited using other programs such as MS Word..."" Hope this helps!"
799,open-ended,B0006I74UK,I am new to this- I have a poem along with a couple of pictures- does this software program allow me to insert this and out comes a colored coded piec,,"Yes. What you do is select ""text"" (icon is T). Then you select the font you like; the numbers signify the number of sts in the height of the capital letters (lower case are shorter, of course). Some of the fonts come with options in the height (such as 8 and 13). Now click in the upper L (or wherever you want) of the empty grid and start typing your poem. As to the picture, I think you mean can you scan and import. Yes. Be aware that the piece will come out in several hundred colors (with their appropriate symbols). This will be way too many. Manually condense the colors to simplify and shorten stitching time. I like no more than 25 colors; YMMV. If you keep all the colors, you'll have to use blended needles for some of the colors. (I hate doing this! Ugh. My mom is ok with blended needles...) mb"

If I buy a copy of Filemaker 10 for my desktop PC can I also load the software on my laptop and onto my wife's laptop or do we need to buy separate copies for each of our three computers?,,In my experience with FM9 it was limited to 2 computers. I am not sure about FM10.

802,open-ended,B00079W5TI,Could I install FMP 10 on a removable data stick so my DB results can be exchanged among computers? How about from Mac OSX to Windows 7?,,No but you can put your database on the flash drive to use on different machines.

807,open-ended,B0007IQG94,What version is being sold?,,Not sure. I bought ace reader pro several years ago. And then I upgraded to ace-reader elite last year. Ace reader elite works best.

808,open-ended,B0007IQG94,I'm a college student-- I want to start reading two books per week. Is this product for for young adults or only young people?,,"I am a college student also, and you can set the level of books that you want to read. As far as reading two books per week, I have found that while this is a great program to increase your reading speed, sometimes you don't want to read that fast. Think of it like driving. Sometimes, you want to enjoy the scenery while others you just want to get to your destination as quickly as possible. For me, I use the speed reading taught int his program for reading blogs, newspapers, and academic papers."
809,open-ended,B0007IQG94,How does this compare to 7 Speed Reading software from eReflect? Has anyone tried both?,,"AceReader is a far superior product than 7 Speed Reading. It has 830 themed and grade-leveled Reading Comprehension Tests, a wide variety of warm-up and text-based Drills to help you learn proper eye movements, and many different Games to both challenge your skills and entertain you at the same time. It also has a guided Course Mode, as well as a fully customizable Reading Mode, where you can change everything from the font size and color to the speed at which the text is presented. You can import your own text into the program for practicing on things you'd need to read anyway, and it comes with 625 e-books, on all different topics, that you can practice. 7 Speed Reading offers only limited tests and does not allow you to customize.

812,open-ended,B0007IQG94,"I am primarily interested in learning to speed read-- Is this the program for me, and what kind of results do users usually see",,"This is absolutely the program for you. It contains 830 reading comprehension tests, themed and grade-leveled, so you'll always know where you stand, as well as numerous drills and fun yet educational games. You can work through an automated Course Mode, or you can choose to customize all aspects of your reading experience through the Reading Mode, including importing your own text into the program to use for practice. And with 625 added e-books, you'll never run out of things on which to practice. Most users see double to triple their baseline reading rate with 15-20 minutes of daily practice, but it does vary from person to person.

813,yes/no,B0007IQG94,Is this software appropriate for a 6 year old child?,?,"Yes, you could use this software for a 6-year old. It has the option of choosing the level of what is being read and gives you the ability to load things your self. That being said, I would not use this for a 6-year old. The program requires consistency and dedication that most (pretty much all) 6-year old children lack. Just you asking the question demonstrates that your child might be exceptional. I would still not do this."

861,open-ended,B00099YLPM,"what is the very basic, yet up-to date- package? Name and approx cost??",,"The Relaxing Rhythms program with the Iom finger sensors included is what you need. You can choose any software as part of a system which has the finger sensors (Iom) as they are what is needed to read your heart rate and skin conductance; these are the measures which are the 'biofeedback' parts which will let you learn how to focus and relax through the games and exercises. The Relaxing Rhythms has better instructions and guided exercises than this Passage program; therefore, it is easier to understand and use for most people. The cost for a Relaxing Rhythms with Iom finger sensors is $299 as the set price from the manufacturer. You can find various options here on Amazon. Make sure to check the feedback, return and guarantee policies such that you align yourself with the most helpful and respected merchant as you might require assistance in the installation process."

I really like the program. Is it worth buying the disk, I don't know. I wish there were updates for this program, but there are not.

I would buy this again if I were in your situation."
874,yes/no,B0009G037A,Can you add date stamps with this software?,?,I haven't added or used date stamps myself so I'm certainly not an expert.

For Deluxe DVD installation, a DVD-ROM or Blu-ray drive is required. (If you do not have a DVD drive in your computer, you should order a download instead of the DVD.)"
879,yes/no,B0009G2K12,I do not see any mention of concordances in your descriptions. Are there any concordances?,Y,"Yes. In the books and dictionaries section of the software there are ""Strong's Greek Dictionary"" and ""Strong's Hebrew Dictionary"".

Instead of searching, you simply click the word you want to view and it pops up with the Strong's concordance greek or hebrew entry for that given KJV word or phrase."

Be very aware that what you very likely will get is a disc that has been registered before to the original owner and the included license key will be denied. Spend a few dollars more and go for Works 9. This is updated and does not require a license key. This was a hard lesson to learn, but is actually fraud in my estimation."

904,open-ended,B000A76ZT8,"The description says 2006, but the picture says 2005. Which is it?",,every thing on my box and the manual says 2006. Maybe it depends where and when you bought it. I'm currently using office and student.

970,yes/no,B000B642OI,is it compatible with windows 7?,Y,I played and reviewed the game on Windows 7. The only Crazy Machines game that didn't work initially was Crazy Machines 2. I have reviews of these games on my website if you're interested (follow the link in my profile) as well as fixes for CM2.
971,yes/no,B000B642OI,Is it suitable for a 5 yr old?,Y,"It might be a little tricky for a 5 year old. I'm guessing this would be better for a child around 7-8 years old. That being said this is a pretty old game and we experienced problems with it on a newer (2004 iMac). Not sure if the same would apply for a windows PC but when we purchased it it was a ""universal"" powerpc binary and the windows version was for windows 95."

The official solution has the domino falling onto right hand stump of the 'basket' and making a bridge with the hooks. The ball switches on the lamp. Also, make sure the solar panel is close enought to the light source, I think this is impotant, but not sure."

Since this isn't the same company that developed and produced The Incredible Machine (in 2001 Sierra Entertainment took over), I wanted to know if this was a successor or just a bad...",,My question exactly. I also really enjoyed The Incredible Machine games and would like to know if this is (1) a worthy successor (2) a blatant rip-off (3) a new twist on an oldie but goodie.

I just did the first one in less than 3 minutes and now I know what I am doing you can get it down to a couple minutes per recipe. Beats the tweedle out of losing the recipes, or keeping an old machine around just for KG. I am going to write up a ""how-to"" doc for my wife to use so she can help (we have over 500 recipes in Key Gourmet). If you would like a copy just post a reply to this."
981,open-ended,B000B7TBNE,Can you print your own cookbook with this program once you compile your favorite recipes? Can this product do this?,,"Hello, I haven't used MasterCook 9.0, but have used and use much earlier versions of MC--4.0 and 5.0--for precisely your pupose. My sister and I started out using and choosing from thier formats, but our book got so large, we are now using it in combination with Publisher so we can add additional features separate from the recipes. I'm not able to comment on the other product you mention. We started our project a little over 10 years ago. MC was the best one we found at the time. For health reasons and others, it has taken us a good while to complete our project, but we've found MC 4.0 and 5.0, even as old as they are, still great resources. Easy to use, quite a few recipe layout options, 5.0 has more complete nutrition information, places to write notes/family anecdotes at the start or finish of your recipe, flexibility with the ingredient list, in case you are using something not included there or are using another recipe as an ingredient. I imagine 9.0 is even better, more updated, though like I say, I can't speak to it directly. Hopefully someone else can help you with that. Good luck with your project. CV"

I love all the features and have logged 419 of our families recipes including pictures with hopes of a cookbook someday. However, that said, it has not been Mac friendly, the updates have included the PC only. So, that leaves the Mac users still using the old version 4.0.6. Meaning, that as new cooking ingredients come to market, you have to add them in yourself. It has huge print problems. I found a workaround, saving the recipes as a PDF and then printing. Another big draw back is having to use it in 'Classic. But, I am exictied today I got an email bulletin about Mariner Software's Mac Gourmet Deluxe.

While all the recipes transferred, my menu's did not. Attaching a recipe to a menu in the older versions was far easier than the current, a major disappointment, but it's still the best software for capturing your own recipes and organizing meals."

1030,yes/no,B000BS2V44,"Is this just for cities. We are going Rome, Florence and Tuscany-- need to be able to get around countryside",?,No it is fantastic for the countryside. We used it to drive from Rome to Corona in Tuscany and then all over Tuscany and Umbria. Just mark your hotel as home and go! We were able to drive to hilltops we saw in the distance with no worries and when done said go home. We used it to drive to Florence but parked outside the city and took the tram via into town to avoid issues with the ZTL and potential fines. Later I flew to Lecce and used it on another rental car there. I did not need the plug in charged for the wall. It charged fine in the car. Hope this helps.
1031,open-ended,B000BS2V44,"How old are the maps on the card, what year is it from?",,Just checked the map date - It's 2013. I used it last summer (2013) and went thru some really small towns (place called Gubio) and it always got me where I was suppose to go without a hitch. I was quite impressed.

1035,yes/no,B000BS2V44,Is this useful for walking directions?,?,"Providing you have a battery-powered GPS. I used my Garmin on a walk from Flaminio to Vatican City. However, I have to say that Google Maps/Navigator on my phone worked a LOT better in Italy overall, especially for walking. Three days into my trip, and after a 60k wild goose chase to a nonexistent grocery store (which Google found 2k away) I put the Garmin back in the suitcase and used Google exclusively."

1037,yes/no,B000BS2V44,Does this chip work with a nuvi 52LM?,?,Not sure. It comes with a SD and micro SD card. It worked with our 2300. I don't see anything on the product details that says it is for only for certain models. I believe you just need a SD slot.
1038,open-ended,B000BS2V44,What is the last date on this chip? I've purchased one that was two years old.,,The date on the box is 2011. The CD is version 1.0. Does Xritephoto make a later version?

But it worked terribly on our trip to Spain in July. Do not recommend, emphatically. Cost us about $500 in fuel and $$$$ in anxiety. I saw cab drivers using Tomtom there, not Garmin."
1042,yes/no,B000BS2V30,Will it work with nuvi 1370T?,?,I don't know the answer to that. I suggest you call NUVI
1043,yes/no,B000BS2V30,Will this microSD card fit into my Garmin Nivi 50LM slot?,?,It is a normal SD mini card
1044,yes/no,B000BS2V30,Does this work with the nuvi 765?,Y,The best place to find out what is compatible with the model you have is to investigate it on the Garmin website first or call the 800 number and then look for the item on Amazon as it is usually a better price.
1045,open-ended,B000BS2V30,what are the directions like for granada?,,"We didn't use it in Granada. However, I feel sure that it would be good. It was quite useful for the other cities."
1046,yes/no,B000BS2V30,is it compatible for germin nuvi 255,?,Not sure. I have micro SD card for Ireland/UK and Australia and they work.
1047,yes/no,B000BS2V30,Will this work in the Nuvi 300/350? It has a slot for an SD card.,Y,"I used it with my Nuvi 255w. The product is a micro-SD card, but you can buy an adapter to plug a micro-SD card into an SD slot. That's what we used and it works fine. In fact when I glanced at the product page on Amazon just now, it showed such an adapter as an item ""frequently bought with this one"". Just a caution: we used this during a driving trip in Portugal last year, and while I was glad we had it, it was painfully dated in places. Portugal has been aggressively building lots of beautiful new highways, and Garmin apparently doesn't know about all of them yet. If I were doing our trip over, I would still use this, but I would also get a quality current paper map (e.g,. Michelin) and plan my routes ahead, rather than entirely relying on the Garmin to pick the best path to a destination."
1048,open-ended,B000BS2V30,what year was this map produced?,,Sorry I can not answer to that question. I returned because it was defective.
1049,open-ended,B000BS2V6M,Are all European cities included? Does anybody know how well Austria is covered?,,"Yes, I just returned from Switzerland and Austria. Coverage of Austria is complete. Just beware of road construction. The unmarked detours of summer road and street construction cause the GPS to send you in circles!"

If you are using first in US, you need to reboot to get it to work in the UK. Reboot by shutting it off. Then while touching screen in lower right corner, turn on unit. Wait until you get reset screen. Answer and it will reboot in new locations. Here is a youtube video...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3hmRS91oOY"

1136,yes/no,B000BX5JQG,Will this work on OS X 10.6.3?,Y,Yes it will. Your computer has to be Mac OS X v10.4.11 or later
1137,yes/no,B000BX5JQG,is it compatable with snow leopard 10.6.8?,Y,"Yes, it is compatable."
1138,yes/no,B000BX5IKI,can you creat dvd slide shows with this program with music?,N,No. This is a photo editor only. Use iPhoto instead.
1139,yes/no,B000BX5IKI,will this work on a computer that is updated to yosemite?,Y,Yes
1140,yes/no,B000BX5IKI,Is this compatible with OS X 10.6?,Y,Yes needs OS X 10.4 or later
1141,yes/no,B000BX5IKI,does this work on mavericks?,Y,"Yes, I have OSX 10.9.4"
1142,open-ended,B000BX5IKI,Hi. Is this a full version or just an upgraded one. Thanks,,I do not know. I have an old version but have never used it.
1143,open-ended,B000BX5IKI,Mac photo editing program: But which photoshop?,,Hi i don't know how serious you are about photo editing but I have done it for years and find Photoshop Elements 6 to be excellent. I have used it for about a year now. It came out later that the one for windows so when windows came out with PE7 for windows I called adobe and asked them if it had more features in the windows version and he said that PE7 for windows was the same as PE 6 for mac because the mac version came out later it had all the new features first. It has many of the features of the much more expensive full version of photoshop. There are online tutorials to help you learn it and there is tech support. I bought it originally for under $100 and upgrades are cheaper. If you do a search you might find it cheaper. The new version of Iphoto is also very good. It comes free with the new macs or it is part of Ilife 09. I have looked into Adobe lightroom and Aperture 2 and have not been persuaded that they are necessary for me. PE6 for mac has raw support for many cameras . Hope that helps. Ron
1144,yes/no,B000BX5IKI,Will Aperture 2.1.1 work with OS X 10.7.5?,Y,"Yes, 2.1.1 will work 10.7.x"
1145,yes/no,B000BYPFT6,Can you use this with Windows 7?,Y,Yes
1146,yes/no,B000BYPFT6,does this work on microsoft 2007,?,According to this it does. http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/software/3247060/mavis-beacon-teaches-typing-25th-anniversary-edition-review/
1147,yes/no,B000BYPFT6,Does this work on windows 8,?,"Not sure about Windows 8, but I have windows 7 and it works for me."
1148,yes/no,B000BYPFT6,Does it come with a book?,?,"So far as I know,nothing comes with a book anymore which is why I am a frequent book buyer at Amazon. You can get new and used books there. I've had good luck with the used and usually buy more than one book on a program."
1149,open-ended,B000BYPFT6,is this cd good for Pc or desk top,,Sure.. The minimum system requirements are Windows 2000 XP. I had a mini computer that I wanted my grandkids to use so this programs worked fine. You need to have a CD drive.
1150,yes/no,B000BYPFT6,Will this program dictate what you need to type?,N,"No, please don't buy this thing. It is a waste of $$. Try some free on-line programs which are much better than this. A big NO on this product."
1151,open-ended,B000CABE4O,a question about whats included in the Manga Studio package: does anyone know if there is a printed instruction book that comes with the package?,,No there isn't but Manga Studio comes with a PDF format manual. Basically an electronic e-book on how to use Manga Studio. I think there is a book called Manga Studio for Dummies if you need a hard copy instruction manual.
1152,open-ended,B000CABE4O,"Does this need any additional software or hardware to use properly?

1159,yes/no,B000CMQ3OS,"Can these fonts be used for resale items such as on Teachers Pay Teachers, etc.?",?,Don't know. Teachers Pay Teachers should have a clue on this.
1160,yes/no,B000E2Z5JU,"Does the software come with a nutrition calculator for recipes (i.e, number of calories, fat, fiber, sugar, etc.)",N,"No, it does not. I asked the author about this and understand that the freeform way ingredients can be entered does not lend itself to systematic analysis. What I have done instead is use one of the web nutrition calculators. The web calculators do restrict you to entering ingredients within the calculator's structure through drop downs and pick lists, but they seem to give a good ""nutrition label"" analysis. I have been using FitWatch.com for this purpose. Given the tradeoff, I'd rather have the freeform text entry in the cooking software than an occasional nutrition analysis."
1161,yes/no,B000E2Z5JU,Can you list a recipe in more than one category?,Y,"Yes. I just did it. You go to the recipe list. Right click on the recipe and a drop-down menu will appear. You can then click on ""copy recipe to another chapter"". I have a chapter labeled Biscotti. I copied one of the recipes to the chapter labeled Cookies. It now appears in both chapters. It is so easy. If you want, on the drop-down menu is also the option to ""move"" a recipe to another chapter. You will love this software. It is so user-friendly. Hope this helps."
1162,open-ended,B000E2Z5JU,what version of software is this and does it work with windows 8,,"I have version 7.53 which was released on October 18, 2013. I also have Windows 8 and they both work perfectly together. The developer, Anthony, is great to work with. Almost immediately, he will respond to any of your questions. His customer service is wonderful. Also, the software is so easy to use. I have been using it for years and love it!"
1163,yes/no,B000E2Z5JU,does this software need keycode I purchase for my wife .,?,"Home Cookin does use a registration code, but the retail version on Amazon will self-register during installation. If you have difficulties, please contact me directly from the Mountain Software web site. Thanks for your support!"
1164,yes/no,B000E2Z5JU,Product features say you can view recipes on some mobile devices. Does this include Android smartphone?,?,Recipes you send to the cloud viewer may be viewed on any device with internet access and a web browser. Most smartphones will work fine.
1165,open-ended,B000E2Z5JU,Will this program operate fully on an IPad? How does it load onto an iPad or lap top?,,"It does not work on an IPad, it is not Apple compatible. It can be loaded to and will run off a flash drive on your pc laptop or desktop if you want to transfer between machines."
1166,yes/no,B000E2Z5JU,Can I scan recipes into the software,?,"There is no OCR, but if your scanner has OCR, you can import the text as a recipe."
1167,yes/no,B000E2Z5JU,can you import recipes from another program?,Y,"Yes, you can import from most other programs and the web."
1168,yes/no,B000E2Z5JU,Can you scan and import a pdf file of your own recipes?,?,"Sorry, I don't know. I have contacted the author from time to time with questions and he responds quickly. I would suggest emailing him directly."
1169,yes/no,B000E2Z5JU,"Is there a way to print recipes so that the Ingredients are on top and direction on the bottom, as opposed to side by side?",?,"Home Cookin always prints recipes with the ingredients and directions side-by-side. This makes the best use of the limited space on index cards, and allows more recipes to be printed on a full page printout."
1170,open-ended,B000EGHMKG,"Is the BDAG (Bauer Danker Arndt Gingrich) Greek Lexicon included in the $359, or does it cost extra to add it on (a la Logos)? thanks.",,"The BDAG (which I have) is an add-on module that costs extra. They have a deal where you can add on the BDAG and the HALOT O.T. lexicon in a bundle and save a substantial amount of money, as it costs way more more to buy them individually. Here is the link to the info on their website (http://store.bibleworks.com/modules.html). I hope this helps!"
1171,open-ended,B000EGHMKG,How does this compare to the $350 version of WordSearch?,,"Joseph, I have not used WordSearch. However, looking at their web site, WordSearch appears to be more like Logos software, which I also use. Logos does some of the things that BibleWorks does, but also contains a *lot* of reference (and otherwise) books in electronic form. Preliminarily, WordSearch looks a lot like Logos. Michael"
1172,yes/no,B000EGHMKG,Are any of the greek bibles in BW9 interlinears?,Y,"Yes. You can actually click a button on the tool bar and display your morphologically tagged Greek text in the interlinear format. So you can essentially use, as it seems from me playing around with it for a few minutes just now, any Greek text that has a morphologically tagged companion text. I would have to mess with it some more to answer more questions on it, but it does have interlinear format options, and they are even labeled as such. Again, there aren't any specific interlinear Bibles per say (such as the Jay P. Green Interlinear Bible), but there is a feature to use your desired text and display it in that type of format. I pray this helps answer your question."
1173,yes/no,B000EGHMKG,"Has anyone used BOTH Bibleworks 9 AND Logos? I am interested in a comparison. It seems Logos offers more, but at a much higher price.",?,"I use both regularly. For fast verse lookup and for translation from the original languages, I find Bibleworks far better. For reference works Logos contains more information and resources. For ease of use, both are okay, but to use all of the features I find Logos a little unwieldy. It probably depends on the application you have in mind and your own training as to which is ""better"". I have personal devotions and do the fundamental work for passage research with Bibleworks, then I use Logos for commentary and reference consultation. If you want quick verse finding, Bibleworks. If you are adept at Biblical languages, Bibleworks. If you want a lot of detail from reference works and commentaries and don't mind a little more effort to find it, Logos."
1174,yes/no,B000EGHMKG,Do they have a version for iMac?,?,"Thanks for your inquiry. BibleWorks does run natively on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 and above; previous versions can be run in virtual machines emulating Windows. We just announced the availability of BibleWorks 10 and are in the process of updating the Amazon web site description. Please visit the BibleWorks web site for full details. Thanks! Rick Gross, Gen Mgr, BibleWorks LLC"
1175,open-ended,B000EGHMKG,How many of my computers am I able to load it on and what the licence allow?,,"I don't know the answer to your question. I have it loaded only on one computer, but I am assuming I would be able to installl it on multiple computers. I found the following info to ask your question. service@bibleworks.com Voice Mail: +1 (757) 627-7100 Internet and E-Mail support requests will be answered before Voice Mail support requests. I hope you find this helpful. Trude Reiser"
1176,yes/no,B000EGHMKG,DOES THIS WORK WITH WINDOWS 8?,?,"I have Windows 7, but on their website they have BibleWorks 9 running on Windows 8, on both tablets and personal computers. Here is the link : (http://www.bibleworks.com/content/sys-req.html). Notice the first bullet point under system requirements says ""Windows XP/Vista/7/8."" I know it will not run on Windows RT, but it will certainly run on Windows 8. Now, I am specifically talking about BibleWorks 9, the newest version. I would email their support team if you plan on buying an older version of BibleWorks. I hope this helps! BibleWorks is a life changing product as far as Bible study is concerned, you will not regret the purchase!"

Came here today to ask my own (different) question and only saw this today. 1. The Spyder2 Express calibrator and software creates a color profile that loads into your OS when you bootup your computer. This color profile adjusts the color settings displayed. It's important when using Spyder2 to find and remove from your OS other color profiles that may have gotten loaded, such as Adobe RGB, or a profile with imaging software, or one that came with your monitor. To see if you have a profile loaded, in WinXP, go to Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Display&gt;Settings&gt;Advanced&gt;Color Management. 2. The Spyder2 Express is designed to be used with a computer monitor, not a TV. There are other color calibrators designed to be used with TVs (and maybe with both TVs and monitors--I don't know, I have no experience calibrating TVs). The S2E would work on a TV when it was being used as a computer display, but not when the TV was showing other material such as cable TV or a DVD, because the color profile generated by calibration is stored on the computer, not in the TV."

1235,open-ended,B000FK88JK,minimum requirements? Does anyone know the minimum requirements for Leopard yet?,,"The requirements are not quite correct. Here's what Apple recommends for the current developer seeds of Leopard: an Intel processor or a PowerPC G4 or G5 processor a DVD drive built-in FireWire at least 256 MB of RAM for a PowerPC based Mac, and 512 MB for an Intel-based Mac [I'd recommend 1 GB either way.] a built-in display or a display connected to an Apple-supplied video card supported by your computer [The Installer may not support your video card.] at least 6 GB of disk space available, or 8 GB if you install the developer tools"
1236,open-ended,B000FK88JK,"Will this pre-order actually arrive on 10/26? Those of you who have had prior experience with pre-ordering os x from amazon, what are your experiences?",,I bit the bullet and went ahead and ordered this and according to amazons estimated ship date it will arrive between Nov 11-16th :(
1237,open-ended,B000FK88JK,I just bought a mac: Will they offer a free upgrade for those who recently purchased a machine?,,"Apple has in the past offered a free upgrade for a new OS if the new system was purchased up to 3 months prior. Counting the months...July, August, September...nope, I would say you are probably out of luck for a free upgrade."
1238,open-ended,B000FK88JK,Panther to Leopard? Will I be able to go directly from Panther (10.3.9) to Leopard without a foray through the rest of the Mac Os cats?,,"Yes, you could buy Leopard, install it on a machine running Jaguar, Panther or Tiger, not have to buy any other version of MacOSX and smile. The normal caveat is that your machine must meet the requirements to install Leopard."
1239,open-ended,B000FK88JK,Apple Sez: Leopard to your Door by the 26th... Amazon sez: ? Will Amazon ship for arrival on the same day?,,"Cancel the Amazon order. It specifically states that it will SHIP on October 26. Plus, I have pre-ordered video games from Amazon before and they shipped, not delivered, on the release date. Boo that. It defeats the purpose of pre ordering."
1240,open-ended,B000FK88JK,"new leopard disk - 10.5 (or) 10.5.1 ? When i order a leopard disk today, are they going to give 10.5 version or the updated 10.5.1 version?",,I would guess that you would receive the 10.5 version. This is what Apple has done in the past.
1241,open-ended,B000FK88JK,Powerbook G4 to tiger: Can I jump to Leopard without any problems?,,"I am in the same boat. I know the PC processor in my PowerBook G4 won't support Snow Leopard, so I am hoping to upgrade to Leopard so I can use some peripherals that require at least OS X 10.5. I checked the requirements to run Leopard on Apple's website and it seems doable with what I have. I am only hesitant because of the price tag. Has anyone installed Leopard on a PowerBook G4?"
1242,open-ended,B000FK88JK,What is the difference between Mac OS X version 10.5.6 leopard(old version) and iMac restore cd with Mac OS X v10.5 leopard,,"I don't have a iMac. I think that the OS X v 10.5 leopard should be the same software for all macs. I have a Power Mac G4 and I really like the OS X version 10.5. Apple upgraded me to a OS X version 10.6. I do have problems with the 10.6 as I don't have the Intel card, so I bypass that part but like the rest. The instructions say that it's for Power Mac, iMacs, and Power Macs G5. I hope that this answers your question."
1243,open-ended,B000FK88JK,can I jump over 10.4? can I jump over OS 10.4 and install 10.5?,,"You can definitely jump over 10.4, as long as your machine is capable of running Leopard. I have done this on multiple computers at work, so yes, I can confirm that a 10.3 to 10.5 upgrade does work (just be sure to archive/install, not upgrade!)"
1244,open-ended,B000FK88JK,Will Leopard work on a Compaq N610c - Intel 2 GHz; 512 MB RAM? Can anyone confirm if it will work?,,"Mark Fetherston, nobody's going to put you behind bars if you put mac os x on non mac hardware. Take it easy there! Ramiah Kandasamy, although both Mac and Windows use intel chips, there is additional hardware in mac computers to make this work. This hardware is not found in non-mac machines, so if you want to do this you can, but you have to hack things as stated previously. Do realize that by doing that, you'll void any support from apple. If you're comfortable working around a computer, you probably don't need their support anyway. If you're not that familiar with computers, either install windows (or linux, which is more difficult to use) on your machine or sell it and buy a mac. Now again, there are things you have to realize when running a mac. The world of software caters to windows first, everything else a distant second. You'll sometimes find yourself scrounging around for drivers for peripherals that come standard with windows. Sometimes, you'll have to work a little to find an equivalent piece of software. If you're into games, realize that a ton of great games simply are not made for the mac."

My thinking was that Quicken might not convert files from one of the older generation Money programs. After trying Quicken I was very dissatisfied with it and stayed with the Money 2007. Conversion of older version information was no problem. I use this software on two computers, one with XP and the other with Vista. Works fine on both and I email myself the backup file from one to the other each time I update on one or the other computer. Good thing, because I have noticed that on occasion Money 2007 reverts back to the new user state and I don't know why.

The box says it is only compatible with Intel-based Macs. Parallels has a snapshot feature. If you get infected with a virus, you can always revert back to the last snapshot before the infection. Hint: take a snapshot after setting up Windows without a network connection, and after configuring it the way you like it. Then go onto the internet. A full install of the Parallels toolset opens up access to the Mac disc drives. Although a Windows virus would not infect the Mac environment via Parallels, it is possible that using an infected Windows Word to edit a Word doc on the Mac would definitely lead to a Macro virus infection of .doc files on the Mac. Sharing such a file with your correspondents would send them the virus, and they would then be infected.

The biggest problem I had with Parallels is they have horrid support. Honestly, the support is what really did me in. When I posted to the Parallels I never got a straight answer from a Parallel employee. I ended up sending a private message to one I found and he was helpful but it was a little late. Additionally, e-mail support was terrible and could never get a straight answer about how to return the product. I went with VMWare and have been happy. I was able to successfully use VMWare converter that converted my old Thinkpad laptop to a VMWare image and dump it on the Mac. It work with it every day.

It is inferior to Q for Windows but, with the exception of a few annoying bugs and omissions (e.g. inability to handle stock spin-offs), it works for me. Like you, I am shocked at what I am reading about Q2010, which is not an upgrade of Q2007 but a completely new, bare bones product (little more than an iPhone App) that doesn't support investment accounts and thus is utterly useless to me. Come April, Intuit will no longer support Q2007 so it appears that Quicken is dead on the Mac platform. I am considering switching to iBank. It is not without its problems but it is regularly updated and is sold by a small, mac-friendly company that (unlike Intuit) cares about its customers."

1328,open-ended,B000H2049I,95 yr. old friend recording life history--any suggestions in using this software? Does anyone have suggestions for how to proceed?,,"Great idea! I did an interview with my late grandfather for a high school history project nearly 20 years ago and though it seemed a daunting assignment at the time, I'm very glad I did so. The cassette tape is the only recording any of us have of him, and I've found it enjoyable to listen to every few years. His story was WWII-centric, as he was a recon pilot and I was aiming for a more historically based interview. I think I had prepared about 10 questions beforehand which gave us a general direction. Of course if he wanted to go a bit off topic, who was I to say no? My advise is to bring over a couple sandwiches, a list of questions both broad and specific and just record whatever happens. Since you have the benefit of much higher technology than I did, you have the freedom to edit out dead air or (dare I say) mindless ramblings. :) Since you say she's sharp that probably won't be a problem though. Many people are a bit wary or self conscious of discussing their life with a tape recorder- start with more lighter fare before attempting to delve into more personal matters. You may want to ask them beforehand if any topics might be verbotten to them. She's not a part of the MySpace generation, understand that many things may be her business and her business alone. You most likely understand her personality and shouldn't have a problem knowing when to press for more information and when to leave a subject that might be uncomfortable for her. I'm sure there are a number of books out there on interviewing skills, but you're talking with a friend not a head of state- have a genuine talk and just see what happens. Sorry if I rambled.."

(Attempting to run Dragon with less RAM will result in a sluggish system, as we discovered in our tests on several computers.) We tested the $149 Dragon NaturallySpeaking Preferred 9. Home users who don't need support for mobile devices can opt for the $99 Standard. Offices that want to run Dragon on a network should choose Professional.

For those who already have this version, there is a patch available to upgrqade to Vista. You need to fill out an online form with name/address/phone/e-mail to get a PIN to access the upgrade area.

Supposedly it should ask you on the first screen whether you want to install the 64bit or 32bit version after it checks to see if you have a 64bit processor. Otherwise it just gives the option for 32bit installation.

Very well put. I use linux, and just bought Vista basic a few hours ago, I had tried xp (x64 pro) even, used it some. but yes, what is wrong with using multiple systems and why insult the other systems? It's childish. This isn't religion or weather or not we have high morals, or a drug, it's an operating system.

1384,open-ended,B000HCTYTE,"32/64 Bit Question, probably been asked to death but who knows. Hey everybody, I heard somewhere that Windows Vista Ultimate comes with both the 32 bit AND 64 bit versions of the OS?",,"Here's an interesting article I found on the tech-recipes Web site: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1426/vista_64_bit_or_32_bit_version_x64_vs_x86 What the author said makes total sense to me. I am posting the article below: Deciding which Vista version to install can be a difficult decision and can really limit what you can do with your system. Here are practical hints which should help a user decide which version to install. I decided to write this guide after installing 64-bit and 32-bit vista systems on several test boxes. With the gaining popularity of 64-bit chipsets/processors, many users now have the ability to run either 64-bit versions (x64) or 32-bit versions (x86) of software and operating systems. However, if you only have a 32-bit processor, your choice is easy... You can only install the x64 version of Vista if you have a 64-bit processor. For those with 64-bit processors, it seems obvious that installing the x64 version of vista would be ideal. The x64 version has increased security based around the 64-bit structure and programs compiled for 64-bit processors will likely run faster. What's the problem with installing Vista x64 on a 64-bit system? 1. Most hardware does not currently have 64-bit drivers. Out of all the boxes that I have installed x64 Vista on, I could always get it to boot up. However, the lack of 64-bit drivers for many hardware devices typically left me without any chance of burning DVDs or listening to audio. Networking devices and card readers were frequently not supported as well. Vista x64 is pretty but it's not very fun without network access or audio. 2. In Vista x64, any driver that is not properly signed will not be able to enter the kernel and will fail to load. Think how many times you have ignored that warning that a certain hardware driver is not properly signed. With vista x64, if your driver has not be blessed by Microsoft, it will not work. Forget about it. I have tired to get around this by booting with the F8 option Disable Driver Signature. It doesn't make a difference. 3. Vista x64 currently does not backward support most x86 (32-bit) drivers. For the most part 64-bit systems run 32-bit applications very well. However, vista x64 doesn't run x86 drivers... at least at this stage. 4. Vista x64 does not support 16-bit software. You may think that you never, ever run 16-bit software. However, XP actually handles this legacy fairly well. 5. Very little x64 software currently exists. x64 software runs better on a x64 system with an x64 OS. Currently, however, there is very little x64 software out there. If you have that magical combination, you do get a nice performance boost. Currently, however, this combination is way to far ahead of the curve. Conclusion: Most users with 64-bit hardware should install the 32-bit (x86) version of Vista. Vista x64 is the turning point for operating systems as they transition to 64-bit. Currently, however, the majority of users will be very disappointed by installing Vista x64. The lack of 64-bit drivers for most current hardware will be very disappointing and frustrating to most users. Why push for 64-bit now anyway? The performance gains promised by 64-bit will not be seen for years until 64-bit compiled versions of software is the norm."
1385,open-ended,B000HCTYTE,How many users per cd-key? I'm wondering how many pcs can be installed with one cd-key?,,"It is one install per CD-KEY. period. the closest thing microsoft has to a ""family"" license is that if you buy the ultimate edition, you can buy (from january to June) two additional licenses for premium edition for $50 each. per this article from Daily Tech. http://www.dailytech.com/Microsoft+Reveals+Downloadable+Vista+Office/article5762.htm The third part of Microsoft's announcement today reveals a limited-time offer for customers who buy retail copies of Windows Vista Ultimate. From January 30 through June 30, the Windows Vista Family Discount will allow North American customers to license two additional copies of Windows Vista Home Premium for use on other PCs in the home at the reduced price of $49.99 each. Before completing the order online, customers will need to enter one valid full or upgrade Windows Vista Ultimate key from their retail boxed product. After eligibility is verified online, the customer can purchase licenses to install Windows Vista Home Premium on one or two additional Windows-based computers."
1386,open-ended,B000HCTYTO,"Will upgrade allow a clean install? Will the upgrade version allow me to perform a clean install, or do I have to keep my old files and other garbage?",,"The upgrade versions will let you perform a clean install, only it will ask you to insert the genuine CD of an older OS during installation to verify you are actually upgrading. Microsoft certainly isn't going to take your word that you already have a copy! Save your money and buy the upgrade versions."
1387,open-ended,B000HCTYTO,How reliable is USPS shipping of Amazon products? Have anyone had bad USPS shipping experience for Amazon products?,,"Your purchase has been divided into 2 orders.

Amazon decided to send it KINDLE their own product USPS.. ITs been sitting in Hayword, CA the past 5 days. The reason i bundled was to avoid USPS.. AMAZON I ask YOU.......WHO gave you the right to UNBUNDLE my order and use a shipping service i never wanted to use? WAY PISSeD off"
1388,open-ended,B000HCTYTO,"Is there a 64bit version for all Vista options? Is there a 64bit version for all Vista options like Basic, Business, Home, Home Advanced, Ultimate, etc.?",,"Dear Dr. Nick, Thanks a lot for this fine question! All versions, 32 Bit and 64 Bit Editions, are delivered on a single DVD. However, the Microsoft Windows Vista Starter Edition is delivered only in 32 Bit version I think if my memory is good! Well, I have 16 Go of memory in my computer so I should have a good memory... When you buy a licence for an Edition (the Business one for instance), you can install the 32 Bit or the 64 Bit Edition as well (only one install at a time). I saw today the Vista RTM for Entreprise and it rocks!!! Best Regards. Vincent Courtois, France."
1389,open-ended,B000HCTYTO,Can it be put on more than one computer? I want to know if I can install the OS on more than one computer using just the one Liscence without having problems or having to buy another?,,"No; this is a single license for a single PC. And at the cost of buying the software, unless you've got a really new PC, it's probably better just to order a new one that ships with Vista if you're shooting for the Ultimate edition. Case in point, you can order a dual-core desktop from Dell for around $580 with a free upgrade to Vista Business. Or you can buy vista ultimate for $400. The computer is the more expensive route (obviously), but Microsoft has decided it's more fun to screw over the computer enthusiast who builds his own computers than it is to provide fair pricing. There's no way Dell is paying anywhere near the recommended retail cost of Vista. Anyway, I've rambled. You'll need a separate copy of Vista for each computer."
1390,open-ended,B000HCTYTO,want an alternative?,,"I had my doubts at first. But, considering the frustration of dealing with Vista, I decided to put my DSL connection to work and downloaded the Dapper Drake Ubuntu .ISO distro. Oh, wow! I remember back in the days when there were such things as self-booting OS diskettes (I remember the ol' daze of DOS). Booting from the resulting burned CD is just so cool in which you can play around with the desktop and THEN decide if you want to commit. The Ubuntu LiveCD detected EVERYTHING I have hooked up in my USB chains without a hitch. And it just looks pretty and functions great! I may be a Linux newbie but I definitely like what I see so far. This is how it should be! And, if there's a command line that needs mastered, I can handle that for I am a DOS veteran. For ease of use this is defnitely something to check out. Heck, it even appears to run better than XP-Pro, much less Vista. More details as I continue to experiment. And, for those who want a taste of the wonders of OSS check out OpenOffice.org. I am never going back to MS-Office."
1391,open-ended,B000HCTYTO,Is a clean install better than an upgrade install? Is that correct?,,"Yes, typically when installing a new operating system a clean install is recommended. Just backup all your important files/docs before because a clean install will of course clean your hard drive of all files!"
1392,open-ended,B000HCTYTO,Why the UK Rip off? Is this a follow up for the Boston Tea Party?,,"Its a reply to the EU anti-trust decision. The EU decision penalized MS for a massive cost, which it will try to recoup. I think Vista standalone converted to about $600, USD, from the European costs. Standalone is $400 in the US."
1393,yes/no,B000HCTYTO,"Upgrading from Windows Vista to Ultimate... If I get Windows Vista Business, but I want to upgrade to Windows Vista Ultimate...is there a cheaper method than buying this one?",?,"You can use the new ""Anytime Upgrade"" feature, suggested price to upgrade from Business to Ultimate is $139 according to information release by MS on Jan 17."
1394,yes/no,B000HCTYTO,"Upgrade version allowing clean installs in different language? I want to upgrade from Windows Home Edition which happens to be in English, and I want to buy Business Edition Upgrade BUT in Spanish, still that, will I be able to perform clean install...",?,"Dear Guillermo S., At installation time, there is an opportunity to select the installation language. I think you cannot upgrade an existing English system to a Spanish system. You must perform a clean install. If you are buying an upgrade Edition, it does not change anything as you can perform a clean install using an upgrade Edition too. However, at installation time, it will prompt you to insert the previous OS CD-ROM to check that you had a previous Microsoft Windows. Best regards. Vincent Courtois, France."
1395,open-ended,B000HCTYTO,64 Bit on DVD? Does the 64 bit version come one the DVD?,,"There is actually only one disk for all versions of Vista being shipped. You have the option to install the 32 or 64 bit version, other than that the version you can install, basic, premium, ultimate, is determined by your cd key."
1396,open-ended,B000HCTYSA,is this 32 bit or 64 bit software?,,"I was unable to use the software that I ordered because it had not for sale on the CD and it would not work on my computer. Be very careful when buying because the merchant will allow you to return the merchandise, but the merchant, evidently does not return your money."
1397,open-ended,B000HCTYSA,"Just to be sure, this is the FULL VERSION, not the OEM version?",,"I received two versions and each had printed on it ""NOT FOR SALE."" I returned the merchandise which cost me $45.00, but the merchant never refunded my money. I would not purchase from the merchant again and I have to contact Amazon again to find out what Amazon will do to get the refund."
1398,yes/no,B000HCTYSA,Will this support my computer with 128 megs RAM and Pentium III 700mhz?,?,"I have never have such masochistic ideas, to even think to try such an install. It might run, but the way Microsoft recoded the graphics routines (which are a core part of Windows) make me believe it will run out of memory just after booting. It will rely heavily on ""virtual memory"" (which is hard disk based) and make it even slower... Seems like an old computer, that will be difficult/expensive to upgrade (RAM, Hard Disk). Dependong on your needs, you are better off using Windows XP (which wont be that fast either, but is less resource hungry tan Vista) or using something like Ubuntu..."

1458,open-ended,B000HCZ9BG,What is the difference between the Upgrade and Full versions? What is the difference between the Upgrade and Full versions?,,"Upgrade edition is to upgrade your current version of Windows to Windows Vista, full version is for a complete install. Full version would be for if your version of Windows is older than the upgradeable versions (in which case your hardware is likely incompatible anyway) or if you're buying a computer that doesn't have an OS (or building one yourself) or if you want to start fresh with Windows Vista after formatting your hard disk. Remember: should you buy the upgrade version and decide to restore your computer to factory at some point, you will need to upgrade your windows version again (if you still want to use Vista)"
1459,open-ended,B000HCZ9BG,Does this include both 64 and 32 bit versions? Does anyone know about this?,,"From what I`ve read, both versions come in the same DVD. Many programs won`t work in the 64 bit version though, as they are not designed for it. See PC Magazine January for more details Regards Roberto"
1460,open-ended,B000HCZ9BG,multiple computers: can you install vista onto multiple computers like microsoft office or is it just one computer per disk?,,"Tennyson said, ""Well, that's it for me. If Bill Gates thinks he can make more billions by charging for a license for each PC then that's the end of the road for me."" Every single version of Windows since 1.0 has been licensed this way. Windows Vista is no different. If you've been using that same (set of) Windows install disk(s) to install on multiple machines WITHOUT purchasing additional licenses, then congratulations, you're a criminal! How's it feel? Instead of letting your software run your computer, why not let your computer run your software for a change? There are free (as in freedom; liberty) operating systems available today, one of which is GNU+Linux (that's the GNU operating system plus the kernel called ""Linux""). There are GNU+Linux ""Live CDs"" that let you try the operating system before you install it on your machine, just to make sure you're going to be able to use the OS. One such Live CD is available at http://www.gnewsense.org/. If you don't have CD burning capability, let me know and I'll ship you a Live CD at no cost to you. Free software is software that comes with the freedoms to use it, modify it, learn from it, and redistribute it any way you want, as long as you don't deny anybody else these same freedoms. If you decide you like GNU+Linux, you can install it on a thousand computers, all from the same CD(s), without ever being forced to buy extra licenses or pay anybody any money of any kind. Don't worry, it's legal, and actually encouraged! The developers of free software want people to be liberated from the tyranny that proprietary software subjects its users (and other developers) to as much as possible, even if it means these developers don't get paid for their work. Free software really is a social, humanitarian movement. If you have any questions whatsoever, please feel free to contact me via e-mail or Jabber at: cparker -at- binaryfreedom -dot- info"
1461,open-ended,B000HCZ9BG,Can i install vista upgrade on a formated drive?

Boot your computer from the vista upgrade DVD 2. When running installation, vista will ask for your product Key, leave the space empty. Vista will ask you if you are sure to continue without entering the product key, click yes 3. When Vista Asks if it should activate the product when online, uncheck the box. 4. A List of different Vista Versions will show on your screen, select the same version you're using, for example, if your installing Vista Home Premium Upgrade, select Vista Home Premium. 5. After the installation completes, Boot your computer and log on into vista, insert the DVD, and run the installation process again, only this time, do enter your product Key, and allow windows to activate itself when online, vista will take care of the rest, when the installation concludes, you'll have your vista system running with your valid license and performing like a clean installation."
1462,open-ended,B000HCZ9BG,I'm buying a new computer...i have a question: Should I purchase my new Dell XPS computer with Vista or XP?,,"Go with XP by all means. Even with all its warts XP does run most of the time. Vista is the worst pile of crap microsoft has foisted on the public since Windows Millenium. Incompatibility with existing programs is by far the least of the problems you will face. Vista manages to hang and require a manual power down reboot about 5 - 9 times a day. MS Office 2007 manages to hang it about 75% of the tie, with Word and Outlook being about equal at being the cause. The rest of the time Windows Explorer stops responding forever. This happens on all 3 of the machines I have that are running Vista. Two of the machines are new and were shipped with Vista, the third was upgraded from XP Professonal. Vista is visually stunning and has some nice features, but when you spend as much as 5 hours a day waiting on hangs and manual reboots it loses its attractiveness very quickly. The Microsoft rep. from Redmond who presented a training session for IT pros and consultants in conjunction with the launch stated that he was sure that Service Pack 1 would be released by April or May and that it should address the stability problems. Well, its now almost October and the stability problems just keep on rolling along with no imminent release of a service pack on the horizon."

1466,open-ended,B000HCZ9BG,Can't use with dial-up? What do others advise?,,"if your PC is 3 years old, I seriously doubt you will be able to install vista premium...maybe basic but why would you do that? be better off sticking with XP and keeping your $100. I would run the vista upgrade advisor, and if you're not a tech-savvy person, take it to someplace like the geek squad at best buy and ask them what it would take to get your pc vista capable if it's possible. bottom line - check things out before you drop $ on anything."

1496,yes/no,B000HCXKJY,Can MS Office Pro 2007 be used on Windows 8.1?,Y,"According to Microsoft, yes, it is compatible."
1497,open-ended,B000HCXKJY,I have 2003 and want to make sure I can just update to this 2007 before I buy?,,Yes. All 2003 files will work in 2007 version. I went from MS Office Pro 2003 to MS Office Pro 2007 with no problems at all.
1498,yes/no,B000HCXKJY,can I install this if I currently do not have MS office on my computer?,N,"NO, this is an upgrade from a previous version ONLY"
1499,open-ended,B000HCXKJY,Will it install and run in Windows 7 64 bit? And does it need a previously installed version of Office to upgrade to?,,"I don't know, but I suspect it will. Check to MS website. I did not buy this here. Well, I did, used, but the license had already been used up so I returned it."
1500,yes/no,B000HCXKJY,Does MS office professional 2007 upgrade have Publisher on it,Y,yes
1501,open-ended,B000HCXKJY,How many PC's can you use this on? Does it have the 2-3 ability with 1 user?,,"I don't know, but it is probably a one user product."
1502,yes/no,B000HCXKJY,does this come with cds will it work with office 2000 premium.does it come with outlook,Y,"As far as I remember, it came with a DVD and upgraded Office 2000. It came with Outlook.."

(there was no prompt to add it)",,"Wow, all you had to do is google office 2007 pro disc 2? And the info pops up. I had forgotten, but here is one of the posts... Business Contact Manager for Outlook 2007. It is not part of Office 2007 installation. It needs to be installed separately after the main Office suite is installed and validated."
1504,yes/no,B000HCXKJY,Will this import Outlook Express 6 (all) in an XP environment?,Y,Yes
1505,open-ended,B000HCZ9AW,I love Ubuntu! Why?,,I haven't found too many games (much less programs) in the store that run on Linux. I do my work at work. Not sure why Linux would be at all useful to me. I already know my PC hardware is not compatible with the Unbuntu drivers supplied on the CD. Why fight easy and useful?
1506,open-ended,B000HCZ9AW,sound problems: IS anyone else having problems with making their audio drivers work.,,"If you have an older Creative Sound Blaster card, it will not work with Vista. Creative, according to their website, has no plans to produce a driver for Vista. When I was using the Release Canidates, I had to enable my onboard audio to get sound. My suggestion: enable onboard audio in your bios if possibe, or upgrade your sound card."
1507,open-ended,B000HCZ9AW,Has anyone installed Vista Home Premium on their Mac? I've seen articles about Ultimate being installed on MacBook Pros but what about this verison?,,"It is my understand you can install this version on a mac with an intel chipset however, from what I understand you need to get an extra program to help with the install. Dont recall the name off hand"
1508,open-ended,B000HCZ9AW,Installing Vista Premium Full on 2 Computers: Can this be done or do I have to purchase an additional license?,,I believe that since your second computer is a laptop that you can install it. It cannot go on two desktops however. I think I remember reading something about one license working for a desktop and laptop at the same time.
1509,open-ended,B000HCZ9AW,replaced the hard drive in my hp laptopwhat do i need get windows vista back on it,,"It would seem to me that you would have to do a re-install of your windows vista, at least that is what I would do IF IT IS COMPLETELY GONE!"
1510,open-ended,B000HCZ9AW,"downgrading from Vista to XP: Anyone out there know if you have to buy the full version of XP software in order to downgrade from Vista, or if you can just buy the ""upgrade""?",,"Some computer companies ship XP restore disks with Vista computers. Dell offers the ability to buy some computers with XP installed. If you get a computer with Vista, I think you legally have the right to replace it with XP, and you can always download XP from some software pirate site. If you get a laptop that already has Vista, chances are you're not going to have too many problems, unless you have something that's not Vista compatible. You could also disable all the stupid ""security"" pop-ups. You should also consider buying a Mac laptop. Most people really like them, and with it you can duel-boot with XP, Vista, Linux, whatever (but you would have to buy the XP DVD)."
1511,open-ended,B000HCZ9AW,Will Windows Vista get rid of the need for Nero or Roxio? Does Windows Vista come with full CD/DVD burning capabilities?,,"of course it should. It's just like xp feature called the drag and drop. Right click on whatever file you wanna burn, go to send to and then select DVD-Rw drive and it will tell you it's ready to burn."
1512,open-ended,B000HDKVCM,What is Service Desk Edition?,,"To quote eHow: ""The key difference between the Service Desk Edition and Standard Edition of Microsoft Office is packaging. The Service Desk Edition is sold in a plastic case similar to a DVD case, while the Standard Edition is sold in a cardboard box. The smaller case allows retailers to hang these editions from a peg at their service desks in order to advertise upgrades of Microsoft Office.""

1513,yes/no,B000HDKVCM,I want an alternative to office 365. Will this 2007 work with Windows 8.1?,Y,Yes. It works with 8.1 too. I just upgraded (from win 8) to win 8.1 and the MS 2007 still works just fine.
1514,yes/no,B000HDKVCM,Does this version come with a disc?,?,"This product came with a disc and a plastic key card. It was necessary to go to a website to activate. I decided I did not want to ""store"" in the ""cloud"" when making a choice. I just wanted it on my computer - hope I did that correctly! The CD was for Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2007 with online activation - an enclosed note indicated that it was for 3. Also included was a key card (labeled 1PC) for Office Home &Student 2013."
1515,open-ended,B000HDKVCM,Is this software a full version install or only upgrade install?,,I found the packaging for the product received: Included was a CD for Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2007 with online activation - an enclosed note indicated that it was for 3. Also included was a key card (labeled 1PC) for Office Home & Student 2013. I downloaded the 2013 to one computer and 1 of the 2007 to another. No problems thus far.
1516,open-ended,B000HDKVCM,Can it print address labels and does it have an address book,,Yes
1517,open-ended,B000HDKVCM,does it come with a license or activation key?,,"Mine came with a activation key. It doesn't come with a box, however, just in a CD sleeve."
1518,yes/no,B000HDKVCM,All of my Word &amp; Excel files were created on in Office 2003 (Vista O/S 32-bit). Can I open/save those files on a new laptop with Windows 8.1?,Y,"I'd say 'yes'. I currently have a Dell PC with Windows 2007 and Office 2007, and when it came time to use files created by Word 2000, there was no problem--it was fairly automatic. At most, you might need to right-click on the file, click on Properties and then Compatibility, but it's been my experience that MS is smarter than most of us, and that it just takes care of that. Boogey on!"
1519,yes/no,B000HDKVCM,"If one of my computers dies, can I reload this software on a new computer as long as I am only running it on 3 pc's?",?,Depends on your license.
1520,open-ended,B000HDKVCM,What is the difference between the Student and Home versions?,,I dont know I never received this product

1523,yes/no,B000HKIM7Q,Can you read the comics with out printing them?,Y,Yes
1524,open-ended,B000HKIM7Q,"when you print them, what is the printing format? Is it page by page or 2 per one?",,"It prints then 1 PDF page or 2 comic pages at a time. Just a heads up though, it will print with the watermark over everything making it hard to read. I performed a comic for a forensic competition and needed to provide source material, so I screen shot each page then put that into a word document and saved it as a PDF. This circumnavigated the watermark, but was a little tedious getting the adjusting the size and cropping the screen shots."
1525,open-ended,B000HKIM7Q,"How do i use this? I want to get this, but do I need winzip or anything?",,You just put it in your DVD drive and enjoy. You need Adobe Reader not Flash
1526,open-ended,B000HKIM7Q,Amazing Fantasy #15: Does anyone know if the origin story is on there?,,Yes it is...
1527,open-ended,B000HKIM7Q,"Is this information correct? The one I got, and it even looks opened or at least treated very badly, has comics only through JUNE 2006, and a total of 560 complete comic books including (same stuff) So is this a shipping mistake, a bait-and-switch, or...",,"If you go on the manufacturer's website, they changed the material. You now get only 560 comics instead of 575. I guess if they waited for Marvel Civil War to be over, the we will have to wait until next March or April to finally get it."
1528,open-ended,B000HKIM7Q,"Is there a release date for this? I can't even fins a website or contact details for GIT Corp in order to ask them directly, so does anyone out thereknow?",,"Mark, I had trouble finding information on this as well. The GIT website is www.gitcorp.com and you can find this collection under the coming soon section. Unfortunatly it only says Holiday Season 2006 as the release date."
1529,open-ended,B000HKIM7Q,"Are these the legit books, or the horrid digitized versions like on Marvel.com's archives? I am dying to know if these are legit scans of the books, or that horrid digitized look from Marvels online archives?",,"James, Just for your info, all images are from the original comic books, none of the complete collection including The Avengers are from the remastered digital like stuff you see in the masterworks. I know for sure because my company produced these fine products."
1530,open-ended,B000HKIM7Q,Portable Device Use? Can I download these to an iPad or iPod?,,"if they're pdf's you can use cloudreader, comicbooklover or any number of ipad apps."
1531,open-ended,B000HKIM7Q,International copy write law? Why won't Amazon post this item to the minor country of New Zealand but will post the CDROM set?,,"This is the US site, stuff posted on THIS Amazon applies to US items."
1532,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,"I am running windows 8.1 and was wondering if anyone knew how to access the search engine in this OS. I can open individual issues, but don't know ho",,"I don't know about Windows 8.1 or know why it would be different than anything else. On my old XP machine, I just follow the single-sheet instructions that came with the DVD. Launch the Start.pdf file at the DVD's root directory and Acrobat (mine is Adobe Reader XI) shows you covers of the issues gathered in decades or years. Do an Edit/Advanced Search and be sure you're searching the file MAD1.pdx file and tell it what you're looking for. I tried ""put*on"" and after spinning the disc a few times it brought up the parody of the movie Patton in the Jan 1971 issue. Surprisingly, the index seems to include words that are in the (hand-drawn) cartoons which means some poor guy had to manually type all those in. When I tried just the Find, I didn't get anything useful. I can't imagine what would be different if you were using Win8.1. Do your search from within the Adobe program, not some Windows search (which may not break through compressions, crypto, or encodings - I don't know). [P.S. All of your question didn't come through, ended with ""but didn't know ho""]"
1533,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,Absolutely Mad DVD bonus material? Am I looking in the wrong place?,,"While this product is a lot of fun, there is one glaring error; they forgot to scan those in. If you look enough on the internet you can find pictures of them."
1534,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,Will this product work with Windows 7? Will this product work with Windows 7?,,"It works fine on Windows 7; inserting the disc just opens a PDF file that allows you to browse the various other PDF files (organized by decade of publication). Most computers already have Adobe Reader installed for reading PDF files. If you do not, you can always get the latest version for free at http://get.adobe.com/reader/."
1535,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,Does anyone know if this will run under Windows 8?,,Yes runs fine on Windows 8' they are just pdf files.
1536,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,I have a laptop using Win 8 And just recently inherited a Galaxy Tab2 10.1 any info on how I can load this onto my tab for reading on the go?,,"Being sensitive to the people around me, I find it best to covertly read my MAD Magazine cloaked in a US News & World Report, People, O Magazine, Car & Driver, or Playboy. MAD may be considered NSFW. However, if you want to read it stashed within a tablet, the DVD is basically a stack of .pdf files. So, you'd need a DVD reader to connect to something (maybe your laptop) and then just manually drag all the .pdf files somehow over to your tablet. If your tablet won't open .pdf files then you're going to be dead meat, unless some Cloud-based service (Adobe) will convert them for you. However, I'm not sure how well satirical American humor will go over in a Korean (or Chinese or Japanese) tablet. Different cultures you know."
1537,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,iPad Compatible? Do issues reside as individual files that can be transferred over to the iPad?,,"I don't have the product, but judging solely on the other reviews, I would say yes. There are reviews where the reviewer transferred individual issues to PDAs etc, so as long as you can transfer individual PDFs to the iPad, you should be set."
1538,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,"I have the 2006 single DVD and the last issue is #460, December of 2005. The new version seems to be two DVD. Does the new version cover the issues beyond 2005 and issue #460? How many years are covered after 2005? Thanks.",,I just bought this about 1 month ago and it was a single DVD with the last issue in 2005 like yours.
1539,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,Will this item ever be in stock??? Can someone from Amazon help me (a MAD geek) with this?,,I am in the same boat. I ordered this about a month ago and I just got an e-mail showing that the delivery is pushed back another 1-2 weeks. I'm wondering if Amazon really does have them at all.
1540,open-ended,B000HKMQ64,Does the DVD include Don's Joe Fonebone cartoon? What is the quality?,,"Hello Christopher! I haven't forgotten you. I've been in the hospital and I haven't felt quite up to the task yet. I will go through the '60s material as soon as I can, but I am certain that the cartoon is there. They have simply taken everything including special issues and put them conveniently on a disk. It is well done and even easy to add to an pad. After I read my iPad issues I will delete them and add other issues from my main computer. I am an. Astronomer and plan to buy Astronomy magazine on a disk as well. Every issue all the way from 1973 is on there. These all inclusive disks are a good way to keep multiple issues for life without having to have massive amounts of storage space for hundreds of magazines. And your issues won't rip and tear and you won't spill coffee on them ( or I hope not for your iPads sake, ha, ha!). The MAD disk loads easily and to me is a treasure. It is about $59 bucks where as Astronomy will cost about $150 bucks,but you get so much. I am glad I bought it because I will be reading material that I missed for the next several years! Sorry about the delay, but I have been really sick lately. Let me know if you decide to purchase before my search and if you do, what your experience is. Russ"

I tried running my old 3.0 version on it and it crashed my whole system. After I got my computer up and running again, I called Adobe 3 times asking about the 5.0. I was worried that my it would crash my system again before I could download the patch, and the cost of the new program would be a waste. They kept saying it would be ok. Well, I held my breath and tried it a few days ago. And it is up and running fine. Isn't the new Vista such a pain in the butt??"
1542,open-ended,B000HLV59W,Photoshop 5: Must one delete PS 2 and/or Photoshop 3 before installing Photoshop 5?,,No. Absolutely not. The apps can co-exist peacefully and even run at the same time. (BTW: I assume you are talking about PSE 2 and/or three not PS - unless you are still running PS versions from the early nineties)
1543,open-ended,B000HLV59W,Photoshop 5 or 6 What's the difference? What does PS6 have that 5 doesn't have?,,"quick answer, nothing. lol. As far as I can tell the only real difference between 5 vs 6 & 7 is the color. I used the trial verstion of 7.0 and I'm sticking with my 5.0 until they make a version with something new."

1546,open-ended,B000HLV59W,Elements or Paint Shop??? Does anyone have an opinion on which program is better?,,"I have Elements 5 and Paintshop Pro 8 (and 7). All are very good, but the emphasis is different. I use Elements for processing my DSLR photos using the included Adobe Camera Raw. It is reasonably easy to use and the quality of the results is excellent. I use the PTlens plugin to correct for lens defects and Elements works well with this. I very occasionally like to use a feature that Adobe has left out in order to avoid competing with full Photoshop. Examples include Curves adjustment layers and fully automated batch editing. In this case I switch to Paintshop Pro, which invariably does have the missing feature. If you don't know why you would need these features, you probably don't! I don't use the built in Organiser, because I started using Picassa (free from Google) for this purpose and I see no reason to change. For design work, such as web design, I would personally choose to use Paintshop Pro, because its feature set is more complete, (Paintshop Pro 8 is roughly equivalent to Photoshop version 6), and because those advanced features are more easily accessible. Other people that I know would choose to use full Photoshop instead, and I can understand their point of view. Photoshop Elements needs quite a powerfull (i.e. new) computer, if it is not to seem slow. I understand that this is also true for the latest Paint Shop Pro. Finally, you can download both of these products for a free month's trial, so why not try then out and make your mind up after that?"
1547,open-ended,B000HLV59W,Layers and Brushes: Can Elements do all these things?,,"In Elements, you will still be able to use all the features you mentions. What elements is lacking is stuff you or I would probably never use, like support from RAW formated photos and vector graphix, or a feature called image warp. CS2 is more for the proffesional user so most likely theres not much of anything you will miss by switching to elements."
1548,open-ended,B000HLV59W,Is this the product I need?? Do I really need to upgrade to Elements?,,"No, I would think not. Try instead the excellent freeware Picasa from google."

1563,open-ended,B000HRZ8QC,95 yr. old friend recording life history--any suggestions in using this software? Does anyone have suggestions for how to proceed?,,"Great idea! I did an interview with my late grandfather for a high school history project nearly 20 years ago and though it seemed a daunting assignment at the time, I'm very glad I did so. The cassette tape is the only recording any of us have of him, and I've found it enjoyable to listen to every few years. His story was WWII-centric, as he was a recon pilot and I was aiming for a more historically based interview. I think I had prepared about 10 questions beforehand which gave us a general direction. Of course if he wanted to go a bit off topic, who was I to say no? My advise is to bring over a couple sandwiches, a list of questions both broad and specific and just record whatever happens. Since you have the benefit of much higher technology than I did, you have the freedom to edit out dead air or (dare I say) mindless ramblings. :) Since you say she's sharp that probably won't be a problem though. Many people are a bit wary or self conscious of discussing their life with a tape recorder- start with more lighter fare before attempting to delve into more personal matters. You may want to ask them beforehand if any topics might be verbotten to them. She's not a part of the MySpace generation, understand that many things may be her business and her business alone. You most likely understand her personality and shouldn't have a problem knowing when to press for more information and when to leave a subject that might be uncomfortable for her. I'm sure there are a number of books out there on interviewing skills, but you're talking with a friend not a head of state- have a genuine talk and just see what happens. Sorry if I rambled.."

(Attempting to run Dragon with less RAM will result in a sluggish system, as we discovered in our tests on several computers.) We tested the $149 Dragon NaturallySpeaking Preferred 9. Home users who don't need support for mobile devices can opt for the $99 Standard. Offices that want to run Dragon on a network should choose Professional. Legal and Medical editions are also available."
1565,open-ended,B000HRZ8QC,Digital voice recorder - which do I buy Standard or Preferred? Will the standard version of Dragon 9 do the same?,,The Standard Version will not transcribe from a voice recorder only the preferred edition.

1628,yes/no,B000J16PGS,Can you resize recipes?,?,"Yes, Marilyn, you can resize recipes... it's called ""scaling recipes"" under the ""help"" section of MC 8. It can be done in several places, but most common is when you're in the ""edit recipe"" mode. Here's the instructions as given by MC 8: Recipe Scaling scales individual ingredients to change the total quantity produced by the recipe. MasterCook lets you input your own number of servings and your computer will adjust the ingredient amounts appropriately. This will often come in handy, but note that for a variety of reasons related to food chemistry, some recipes simply will not turn out the way the recipe author intended when you scale them. Souffls and other delicate foods are nearly impossible to scale. Some culinary experts warn against scaling complex recipes by more than a factor of two and against scaling recipes for baked goods at all. But for those recipes that can be scaled: To scale a recipe: 1. There are many areas and situations where the Scale feature is activated. The screen where you'll probably use the Scale feature most often is the Recipe Edit screen. 2. Click the Scale Recipe icon on the toolbar. 3. A box appears prompting you to enter a new number of servings. 4. Type in a new serving size and click OK. The ingredient amounts are adjusted to accommodate the new number of servings. In addition, the measurement units are also changed where appropriate. The cooking time and pan size are not adjusted. Hot Tip: Scaling affects only items in the Amount column. Be sure to check values such as pan sizes and cooking times which will need to be adjusted manually. 2004 ValuSoft, a division of THQ Inc. All Rights Reserved."

Learn about the new features of DiskWarrior 4 and how to upgrade by clicking here. ""Please note that to install DiskWarrior 4 onto your hard disk, your Mac must start up in OS X 10.3.9 through 10.9. Please read the system requirements for DiskWarrior 4. ""DiskWarrior 4 version 4.4 is now available on DiskWarrior DVD revision 1109. This DVD is a universal startup DVD that can start up both PowerPC and Intel Macs. All Mac models meeting the system requirements for DiskWarrior can be started from the DVD. The current DiskWarrior DVD cannot start up the new MacBook Pros introduced June 11, 2012. An updated disc that will also start up these recent Mac models will be released as soon as Apple, Inc. releases new startup files to Alsoft, Inc. and other developers. Some older iMacs with wireless keyboards have timing issues when starting up from any DVD.

Since July I've been using Wave accounting, which is a free cloud invoicing system. It's so much better & so many report options."

1665,open-ended,B000KQWETO,Does this print a paper label that I then attach to a CD? Or does this print directly onto the face of a blank white CD?,,"It prints a paper label that you attach, but a word of caution is that in some CD players, the paper label leads to poor playing, i.e., skipping, etc."
1666,yes/no,B000KQWETO,Can it print to LightScribe disks?,Y,"yes, I have done it many times"
1667,yes/no,B000KQWETO,Is this program compatible with windows 8.1 and windows vista?,Y,Yes . I am using it on Windows 8.1.

1669,yes/no,B000KQWETO,can I use this software for lightscribe labeling,?,"You must first have lightscribe installed on the computer, then you can use this label maker to design your label and print it on the disc by selecting the icon on the label maker tool bar to write it on the disc - on my tool bar it is the fourth icon from the left."
1670,yes/no,B000KQWETO,is this software for lightscribe?,Y,Yes very nicely. I've used it on about 200 CD projects and it's only messed up twice. To be fair is don't know if it was Acoustica or Light scribe tat messed up. Product worth the price.

1673,open-ended,B000KSQ466,"I would like to know if the newer (newest) version still has the calendar with it. lost old disc, so could not transfer to new computer.",,The version I bought a few years ago does include the calendar. Our old disc would not install on a new computer and my wife loves the calendar portion of the program. There is apparently no difference in the latest version. Jack

1676,open-ended,B000KY156E,Hey. How is the metod if I buy the EZ Drumer. download? or FIsical delivery? Than u,,"You can buy it either way. I have done both. The Toontrack process at their web site is very secure, so there are a number of steps. You have to do this if you buy the physical product or the download."
1677,yes/no,B000KY156E,"I use Sibelius and ProTools to create tracks and Cake Walk to play them on the gig. I am looking for a way to make my midi drum patterns sound ""non midi"". Is EZDrummer a good choice??",?,"EZ Drummer is one of the most real sounding Midi kits I've heard. The sounds themselves are actual drum recordings and triggered by Midi files. They also have some tweaking ability that can be edited..... like velocity and it has a humanize feature that adds randomness. If you really want to get down to extensive editing the (Superior Drummer albeit more expensive) offers more but I've found for my projects EZ Drummer fits in rather well. And if you want to, you can also create your own Midi files to trigger the kits."
1678,open-ended,B000KY156E,HOw to use EZdrunmmer with Zoom R24,,"I do not own this product but what I can tell is that e z drummer will need to be installed in a vst folder on a pc or laptop within a recording software such as cubase,protools,etc.the e z drummer set up is just that,ez !! just follow the directions that come with the disc and you should be fine.after insallation,you need to open the recording software and load ez drummer.this may vary from software to software but what you are looking for is the vst instruments panel.once you find it,click on ""open grooves"" and a selection of drum grooves will be displayed.you will see a bar on the interface that is like a play button.after you select a groove.press play and it should play.ez drummer grooves can be dragged and dropped into the recording lane of your software creating a recorded path that can be edited or added to once you get the basics of it,it really is quite fun.I don't know if the zoom r 24 comes with cubase or not but that is going to be the first step in using ez drummer.Good luck and remember to be creative!!!"
1679,open-ended,B000KY156E,Works EZdrummer on mavericks and yosemite?,,No
1680,yes/no,B000KY156E,Will this work with Reaper software?,?,"I do not use Reaper but a quick scan of some forums and many do use EZ Drummer in Reaper. Any host application that utilizes Audio Unit, VST, AAX or RTAS should work fine including Reaper."
1681,yes/no,B000KY156E,Can this be used with Power Tracks and Real Band?,?,It SHOULD work with any DAW host that supports VSTI's. Toontrack has a demo on their website to download and try. That'll give you some idea if it'll work for you or not.
1682,yes/no,B000L3APBK,Is this compatible with garmin nuvi 1490?,Y,"Yes, the UK-Ireland micro SD card worked amazingly well with the Garmin Nuvi 1490. I used this SD card on a trip to Ireland in July 2013. We drove from Dublin to Cashel then Adare (our base for 6 days) where we day tripped to Bunratty Castle, Dingle, Doolin (to go to Inish Orhe [the smallest of the Aran Islands], Cliffs of Morhe, then to Ennis for dinner), Kilerny National Park, back to Dublin, Howth & Dalky. All in all just over 900 miles over a 10 day period. If you are going to Ireland my three caveats are 1. use the 1490 on roads you know before you go as it can sometimes be querky on how things are named if you are not imputting an exact address (never failed with an exact address or GPS coordinates); 2. driving is on the left with right hand steering - learn my friend Tom's mantra, 'hug left, cross right' (it will make more sense once you're actually driving); and 3. rent the smallest car possible that will be comfortable for your journeys (the roads are extremely narrow, often single lane [outside of cities], and often very winding."
1683,yes/no,B000L3APBK,Is this memory card compatible with Garmin's nuvi 205w?,Y,"I don't have the nunvi 205w mine is the 1370 but I really think that if it fits in my nuvi it really should fit in yours. This is great if your going to Ireland. I know my way around most of England and didn't need to use it that much. When I did use it, at times it wasn't very clear. But never the less it beats asking two guys in a pub and getting different directions!"
1684,yes/no,B000L3APBK,Is it compatible with a garmin 265wt. Is this the latest maps out,?,"That is not the Garmin I have, but I would think a micro-slot is a micro-slot and they would be compatible across the board. As far as Great Britain goes, the roads don't change much unless there is perhaps a brand new housing development you are trying to get to. We found it very helpful. The only problem was one B& B in Wales which didn't have a good address. The tiny village was listed under the name of the larger town next to it (probably where the post office is). That took some calling around to find but we were still helped immensely by the GPS maps. Once there, we could record the place using the locator feature. Hope this helps."
1685,open-ended,B000L3APBK,Current revision. Does anyone know the revision of this card?,,I have the same question. Garmin's version is 2013.10. Some reviews here were complaining about the maps being out of date. Could this be the reason this one is so cheap?
1686,yes/no,B000L3APBK,Will it work with nuvi 255w??,Y,Yes it will work with your nuvi 255w. I bought one last summer for my nuvi 295w and it worked flawlessly. Both the 255w and the 295w have Micro-SD slots. The City Navigator UK/Ireland comes as a Micro-SD card inserted in an SD adapter so don't panic when you see an SD card that is too big for your Micro-SD slot--just pull out the Micro-SD chip from the adapter.
1687,open-ended,B000L3APBK,Looking for GPS for Ireland What is the best for country and city driving.,,"We traveled in Ireland from Dublin to Cork to Killarney to Ennis/Shannon in September 2012. Purchased the SD card for my older Garmin which I took with us rather than renting with the rental car(too many fees, not covered by insurance and so on). It was one of the BEST travel decisions we ever made!! Someone suggested inputting coordinates into the Garmin so I looked them up on line in advance. The first day we need to find our hotel(street name only) it took us right to the spot and announced ""arriving at ..."" We truly would have missed it otherwise and just traveled on. The streets are often long, sometimes the names have changed, or winding with a lost of round abouts. The highlighted routes let you know that you are driving in the right direction and tell you which exit on the roundabout to take. When we took a ferry, the car was shown driving across the water! The only time there was a ""hiccup "" with it was when we were trying to get to the Burren. It wanted to take us on many very small back roads. Several locals told us ALL GPS's have this issues so ignore it and follow the directions they gave us. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this little investment more highly!!! When you are there and use it you will immediately understand why we rated this so highly. It is truly invaluable!! Don;t leave home with out it! You will marvel at its ability to keep you on track and you will have much more time to enjoy your time there instead of getting lost and/or wondering if you are going the right direction."
1688,yes/no,B000L3APBK,will it work in my garmin nuvi 760,Y,Worked great in my nuvi 40. Can't speak for the 760. It made a huge difference when traveling in Ireland. Set up the GPS coordinates for our hotels (most had no street number or address) and places we wanted to see. Drove right to them. Check with the 760 manual about using external maps.
1689,open-ended,B000L3APBK,"The description states ""Microsd card, city navigator nt, UK"" - is it really a MicroSD card?",,"Yes, it is ridiculously tiny - but if you have a regular SD slot you might be able to get an adaptor in Walmart, etc."
1690,yes/no,B000L3APBK,Will this card work with older model Garmin's from the States?,Y,I think you should check the manufactures website. www.garmin.com but I used my U.S. bought Garmin that was about four years old. I think as long as you have an SD or Micro SD slot it will work. Don't leave home without it.
1691,yes/no,B000L3APBK,is this compatible with Nuvi 50,?,probably as long as the nuvi 50 accepts an sd card. I suggest you call Garmin customer service directly to confirm. they are usually responsive and helpful.
1692,yes/no,B000M4L972,does this work with windows 7 also?,?,It did with mine. I really like it and it's easier to operate.
1693,open-ended,B000M4L972,How many PC can one install this on?,,"I bought Office 2007 Home & Student - Spanish, serial / key version without CD, so I downloaded from Microsoft English version & installed in three differents computers, same IP."
1694,open-ended,B000M4L972,"Does this product work with windows 8, 64 bit? And is this the disc version for three home computers?",,Yes. My computer is a Windows 8 and it worked. You get to install in 3 computers.
1695,open-ended,B000ME8JB6,Do you know how to guide me to run in compatibility mode? The error message I get is this is incompatible and I need to ask for 64 bit version.,,I have no idea. I am glad I still have an old PC that is working.
1696,yes/no,B000ME8JB6,is this software compatable with Windows XP?,?,Definitely. Run in compatibility mode.
1697,yes/no,B000ME8JB6,Is the CD compatible with a computer that uses Windows 7?,Y,"Currently running it with Windows 7. After installing, click properties and run in compatibility mode."
1698,yes/no,B000MKMVRI,Will it work with windows7?,Y,"Yes. If you go to the EQ website it says System requirements for EQ6 *Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7 *Internet access for activation (4 activations included) *CD-ROM drive *Internet Explorer 5 or higher *700 MB of hard drive space *Monitor with screen resolution of 1024 x 768 or greater *Sound card recommended for demo videos I love it and it goes with several other softwares like Dear Jane and Sylvia's Bridal quilt etc."
1699,open-ended,B000MKMVRI,"Is what is advertised here an update or a complete new program? If I don't have any previous EQ, can I use this?",,I am pretty sure it is a full EQ 6 software program. Yes you can use this without any previous EQ's. It is a great program and very good user instructions. Enjoy!
1700,yes/no,B000MKMVRI,can you create paper piecing patterns from pictures with this?,Y,Yes. You need straight on pic of the design and draft the parts over top of a scanned in picture and then print in paper piecing mode.
1701,yes/no,B000MKMVRI,"Could you, create strips (egs 2.5"" strips 40"" long sewn in rows stacked 6 strips tall then cut out on point squares and rotate them around?",?,"You are asking a question related to construction, this is a design program and if you have a design in mind you can most likely create it in this program, The program gives you the ability to print out actual size templates and also provides cutting directions based on the color placement as well as the individual shapes. Your question relates to planning how to cut. Hope this helps."
1702,open-ended,B000MKMVRI,IA it available for Macs?,,"Yes I think it does, although there is a newer version 7 now available. For further information check website electricquilt.com"
1703,open-ended,B000MKMVRI,how is it to design and layout quilt patterns?,,"Very easy to use. Fun to try the different loaded designs and layouts, then try your own. I would definitely recommend."
1704,open-ended,B000MKMVRI,Windows 8 compatable?,,"Minimum system requirements for EQ6 to EQ7 Upgrade *Upgrade version of Electric Quilt 7 will install only if you are a licensed user of Electric Quilt 6 (EQ6) go to the site and call the number too 419-352-1134 a real person will talk to you.

1705,open-ended,B000MN8R5A,"If I buy the DVD City Navigator Europe, can I then load the maps from my comuter into the Garmin device or do I also need to buy the micro-SD version?",,"The specific answer is no, you need one or the other but not both. The advantage of buying the pre-loaded micro-SD version is you are all done. Its just plug and play (or so I read). The disadvantage is the pre-loaded mem card version can not be upgraded which is why I bought the DVD. The DVD version can be updated and they even have a life time update/upgrade you can buy which is what I will likely do if I decide to update the euro maps but I am happy with the results so far. That said, it seems just about everyone, including me, has trouble doing the install from the DVD so it is likely that you too will need to call support but they are nice enough and got me through it. It will take you a few hours. You do need to check the FAQ on the Garmin site carefully to assure that your model can have these maps added to it and to confirm that your unit can accept an 8GB card as you will need one that big to get the maps installed. Good luck..."
1706,yes/no,B000MN8R5A,is this the current map for europe nt,?,"The map works great! It includes river crossings, train stations, and solid ""carbonized"" tunnels where your car headlights DON'T WORK!"
1707,open-ended,B000MN8R5A,The dvd I am looking for is Garmin 0101088700 MapSource City Navigator Europe NT v.9.0 When I searched this on Amazon 3 products came up all different prices. Are these the same product? What do they offer differently?,,"Not sure, but when I ordered this mapset in 2009 I purchased the maps already loaded on a micro SD card. No DVD. Possibly explains the price differences; DVD, DVD + microSD, microSD versions????"
1708,open-ended,B000MN8R5A,What year is the version I will be receiving on DVD?,,"I'm not sure I understand the question, but let me answer it this way. You will want to make sure that you get the latest version of this software that Garmin has published, and it will not be easy to tell in advance if that is what the vendor will sell you. If you want to make sure, order it directly from Garmin, or contact the vendor directly before ordering to make sure that they intend to send you the correct version. Since I have been caught before, also make sure that the seller is an authorized vendor of Garmin products. Some companies, e.g., Sony, will not honor a warranty or give you a free upgrade if you did not purchase the product originally from one of their authorized retailers. I am not sure if Garmin has a similar policy, but it might be worth checking before you buy. If I didn't answer your question, try again."
1709,open-ended,B000MN8R5A,What does NT signify. 15 minutes searching for an answer. Why so hard?,,"I believe it is ""New (Compression) Technology""-meaning they can get more data on a smaller memory area"
1710,open-ended,B000MN8R5A,What version is this product?,,"To the best of my knowledge, it will allow an update to the latest version when you install it. Always been that way for me. You could call Garmin and ask. 1 (800) 800-1020"
1711,open-ended,B000MN8R5A,map downloads of NUVI 200 of Europe: Can you find downloadable maps of Europe for a Garmin 200,,I would like to know this too. I am going to Germany and would like to purchase a map for my Garmin nuvi 200.
1712,open-ended,B000MN8R5A,"Latest Version of DVD is Stuck ""Communicating with Server"". What can I do to break through this issue?",,"Hello, I was experiencing the same issue. I registered my maps on my garmin account and downloaded the maps from the site. It worked flawlessly. Hope this works for you, best"
1713,yes/no,B000MNA3BG,would this work with the Garmin Nuvi 40 LM,?,"I think any gps with a micro slot. I have same gps. Worked great in ger, aust, bel , fr and uk last summer. My friend is using now, but will sell to you for $25 now as I am paying for Ivy League schools for a few years and will not be going anyplace but the office. Thx"
1714,yes/no,B000MNA3BG,would this work with Garmin nuvi 2597 LMT ?,?,"Don't really know. Check with Garmin, they should be able to tell you."
1715,yes/no,B000MNA3BG,What version of the europe maps does this include. Is it the latest 2014 maps?,?,"I think I purchased mine last year [2013] and only used it in the Republic of Ireland. Good for street numbers in the biggest cities. But, for the places we traveled, it would get you only the correct street. Most places in the countryside don't have numbered addresses. Used mine in my old Nuvi 260 and it worked fine for our purpose. Hope this helps."
1716,yes/no,B000MNA3BG,Does it include Spain,Y,"Yes, it includes all countries in Europe + Turkey, definitely including Spain, as I can verify from personal experience.

1717,yes/no,B000MNA3BG,Does it work for Pedestrians,Y,"Yes; there is a ""mode"" selection where you can choose walking or driving. The ""walking mode"" will take you on a more direct path, but sometimes misses shortcuts. It's a great idea for Europe or travel when you don't want to pay for streaming data."
1718,yes/no,B000MNA3BG,Does this cover Spain?,N,"No, we went to Italy and only purchased City Maps for walking. We did not rent a car."

1723,yes/no,B000MPM1T6,is there a version of this program that will work on windows 8?,N,"Not that I know of. However, I did find that my old one for Windows 2000 works on Windows 7."
1724,yes/no,B000MPM1T6,will itwork on vista,N,"No, this will not work with Vista. This is an older CDROM version for Windows 98 to XP. Try a new version."
1725,open-ended,B000MPM1T6,what does version 4.0 of 3D home Architect Deluxe have that version 3.0 does not have ?,,"3.0 is the best, it took me a long expensive while to find a new disk, 4.0 isn't bad, both by same authors. After that nothing communicates with past versions, and commands are horrible. Problem is, need to find compatibility mode to run, Bouderbund needs to get the ORIGINAL guys back together to write a new version of 3.!!!"
1726,yes/no,B000MPM1T6,does this program work on Windows 7 ?,Y,Yes it does I actually have it on my windows 8

1729,open-ended,B000MPM1T6,"I have newer versions, but like this. I cannot get the images to print on my new computer?",,I recently had the same problem. I know it will not work on windows 8 operating system. Mine does work on windows XP

What's funny is the front of the box (underneath the flap), which lists significant issues in Captain America's history, lists no less than three occasions on which Cap has ""died"". The only thing that's too bad about this set is that it doesn't include the Golden Age Captain America issues, which is where the character first started out. But those weren't done by Marvel (which didn't exist as Marvel in the 40's and 50's) so I guess they couldn't include them."
1734,open-ended,B000MVP5I4,How would I view this on an iPad? Thank you.,,"Eric, the files are in PDF format so you can easily read them with the iBooks app. Copy files from the DVD to hard drive and then import them into iTunes. They show up under Books.

1737,yes/no,B000MVP6RO,Does this include the Spirits of Vengeance books of the 90s?,?,"From the original Marvel Spotlight's of the 1970s to 2006. So, yes."
1738,open-ended,B000MVP6RO,How would I view this collection on an iPad? Thank you.,,"I don't know specifics of the iPad capabilities, but the data is in .pdf format, so any device that can read Adobe .pdf files should be able to view the documents in the same ways other .pdf files can be viewed. If the iPad can't do that, it may not be possible, or there may be an app available that would allow .pdf viewing. After viewing another users answer I can concur that some devices ot versions of pdf readers do leave a transparent but annoying Marvel logo visible. I haven't run into it in a while, and if it is a bother I would check to see if an updated version of an Adobe pdf reader is available."
1739,open-ended,B000NA1V96,what does it mean no operating system?,,"Possibly there is a kind of error or misunderstanding in connecting ""no operating system"" with Corel Painter X software, and not necessarily on your part. The term ""no operating system"" is sometimes used with a PC offered for sale, where the seller is just selling the hardware but does not include the operating system, such as Windows, Linux or iOS (Apple products). Corel Painter X is available for different operating systems (Windows and MacIntosh come to mind), but the actual software is different for each version. Some software detects what your operating system is, and installs the appropriate code, or informs you that you do not have a compatible operating system on your computer. So, my best guess, since this is not common terminology (I checked Google pretty closely) for describing software or its use, it is not properly applied here and was intended for something else, probably for hardware. The seller may have copied some text from elsewhere, not realizing the mismatch in terms and usage. Hope this helps."
1740,open-ended,B000NA1V96,what is academic version?,,"The Academic version is a fully working Copy of Painter meant for Academic usage, vs commercial. The only differences between the two was that you couldn't get Tech support from Corel (not free), there was no upgrade path, the startup would have Educational Edition on it, and the EULA (End User License Agreement) asked you do not sell artwork with this version"
1741,yes/no,B000NA1V96,Is this also a MACintosh version?,Y,"It should be, I believe both versions were on one DVD. If you get the box like the shown product you should be fine. I had the Academic Copy but got a retail version later, and it has Both OS and a Manual."
1742,yes/no,B000NDICCM,Will this be sold with the serial numbers released so it can be installed on two machines?,Y,"Yes, these programs can be installed on 2 or more computers. And if the serial number has been released."
1743,yes/no,B000NDICCM,Does this work on a laptop with Windows 8?,?,We are still using it on Windows XP as that is what our image setter works best with. I did try CS2 with Windows 8 and it did not work there but did not try CS3 on Windows 8. I would suggest going to Google and asking that question and see the different responses. Some good and some not so goo. Hope this helps you a little.

1747,open-ended,B000NDICCM,How many machines can it be installed on?,,"Pretty sure this is one of the standard ones that allow two machines to run it, but the purpose for that is so that the user can legally use a copy in a second office or laptop."
1748,open-ended,B000NDIB7S,Upgrading from CS2 on Windows to CS3 on Mac: Does anyone know if Adobe supports upgrading from CS2 on Windows platform to CS3 on Mac?,,"I don't know how it is with CS3, but if you contact Adobe Support, they will do a one-time same-version (CS2) platform swap for you, switching you from Windows to Mac. You can then purchase the Mac CS3 upgrade once you have been switched over to the Mac platform."

I did have to uninstall Nix from CS2 before installing it in CS3 though.
1753,open-ended,B000NDIB7S,Regular version to Extended upgrade path? Does Adobe have an upgrade from the regular Photoshop CS3 version to the Extended version?,,"They currently do not, and I doubt they ever will.

1754,open-ended,B000NDIB7S,Which version of PS do you get with the upgrade?,,The Photoshop CS3 upgrade for Windows is currently $195.99. The Photoshop CS3 Extended upgrade for Windows is currently $341.99. You choose which version you wish to upgrade to.

I just had the existing license transferred through AutoDesk for $50.00 and have not had to pay any renewal. Please note though that this will not run on Windows 7 or 8. It has to run on XP which is kind of a pain. I have had good luck with it though.

1793,yes/no,B000OL5IFC,Can you run these through a printer?,N,"Based on the texture of these cards I would strongly caution against doing this. Plus, because these are meant to be worked on in various mediums, such as water colors and pencils, the ink from your printer will likely feather out into the fibers of the notecards and not give you crisp lines, which is likely what you're looking for. Hope this helps."
1794,yes/no,B000OL5IFC,Is the card paper weight 80#?,?,I don't know the weight but it is heavy. I really like them
1795,open-ended,B000OL5IFC,which blank greeting cards are suitable to paint with acrylics?,,I too am an artist and its my opinion these blank greeting cards by strathmore are a quality that would accommodate acrylics. I seem to remember my first order was textured which may or may not work depending on your concept.
1796,open-ended,B000OL5IFC,What are the measurements? Thanks,,5x7
1797,open-ended,B000OL5IFC,what color is the deckle edge,,it's the same color as the paper - cream
1798,yes/no,B000OL5IFC,Would this paper be sturdy enough for mounting photos?,Y,"The paper is sturdy, but porous. I wouldn't use anything but mini glue dots for adhesive. Anything even a little moist would most likely cause the paper to wrinkle as it dried."
1799,yes/no,B000OL5IFC,Is the deckle ivory (same color) ?,Y,"Yes, indeed! These are very lovely cards with matching envelopes. Just be careful when you are ordering, as there may be other color combinations. In the past, I've gotten the ivory cards/envelopes but with gold edging."

1803,open-ended,B000OMJ1E0,"I had to get a new computer, how do I get my dmm reactivated my Serial # wasYQ4FI-PX8RP",,I am pretty sure you are out of luck. The company seems to have gone under and at least my version of the software needs the internet to get fully authorized to run.

1820,yes/no,B000PDNHNO,Does it have a cut tool like final cut?,?,"I don't think you're going to get the fine-tuning of Final Cut. I like Ulead VideoStudio for its ease of use, but it doesn't at all compare to Final Cut. (No, you can't leave gaps in the timeline, and I don't think you can use the arrow key to go frame by frame either.)"
1821,open-ended,B000PDNHNO,Can I incorporate photos and video clips into the same slideshow? Will this program allow both media into the same show?,,"certainly. if you have a digital camera, just plug the usb into it and insert the photos from the camera or from a filed you have saved them"
1822,open-ended,B000PDNHNO,Did ULEAD get rid of the CRASHES somewhere along the way? Has ULEAD really fixed these crashing problems in recent releases?,,"I'm using Ulead 11 and it doesn't seem to be much better. At the moment I can create beautiful videos within VideoStudio and I can watch them inside VideoStudio. As soon as I hit ""Create Disk"" it just crashes. In other cases it shows a dialogbox ""Unspecified Error"" and then terminates. (For developer: I suspect the ""Unspecified Error"" is a disguised exception and if it is it would indicate to me a low-quality software engineering approach) Instead of wasting their software engineers time on custom menus, custom buttons, and other custom controls, it would have been a good idea to just make the three basics work reliably: 1. Get the clips from the video camera 2. Select the ones you want to keep 3. Burn a standard DVD that works on a standard DVD player It's almost as if I had a car with luxurious leather seating yet it's missing the engine... Anyone at Ulead (now part of Corel) trying to fix this? What's their QA department looking like? So if you are looking for a working product you may want to wait until version 12 or even later. And then get a trial copy first. I'd recommend to not pay any money until they prove the newer version is better."

1827,yes/no,B000PS6QY6,does it edit vhs,N,"It does not edit vhs tapes, but will edit video from vhs tapes that have been transferred to a computer. To do so on your own computer would either require a computer, or a hardware accesary that lets you connect the VHS to the computer."
1828,open-ended,B000PS6QY6,AVCHD: can this program combine separate .m2ts files into one larger .m2ts file without re-compression?,,"Yes it can. I combined several MiniDVD's (5- 3in) in one DVD (DL). My problem is that I'm using Panasonic HDC-DX1 which creates the MiniDVD's using Blue-Ray format. To keep the High Def mode you are limited in the amount of video you can store in Blue-Ray format since you are not burning a Blue-Ray disk. Using a std DVD (DL) for the most storage I can get about 64-72 minutes (depending on bit rate) of video and keep the High Def quality. Studio 11 will combine the video if you paste each MiniDVD into the timeline separately and then make a new disk. There are lots of options to chose from and you can get more on a disk with lesser quality. One thing to remember the other comments are correct in that creation in Studio takes a long time, so don't give up while you're doing it. I'm using a 3.2 GHZ Pentium 4 with 2 GB of RAM. It took about 20 Hrs (of Rendering) to make a 70 minute Blue-Ray compatible DVD. I've also used Nero 8 and that also takes a long time too. Good Luck"

Microsoft Works is a BASIC do everything package and it is not very useful in anything you asked. It is very limited in the things it does do. It has a lot of templates for people that want something to do basic things for them. The word processor is very basic and helps if you are not a good speller for instance. I found that for things that you call house hold chores that there was nothing that I could uses it for because you had to use something and a format that was chosen by someone that you could not change in any way. I found the data base part of the software to be very useful for my needs and use it very often. I think that you will find that is the case with any ""do everything"" software. I think in the long run it is best to buy the specific software for each thing you want to do rather than a do all do nothing right package. Harold"

1840,yes/no,B000QO76HU,"Can YNAB create year-end tax reports, similar to Quicken? I don't import directly to Turbo Tax, but instead use Quickens summary reports.",?,Sort of. I make sure to set up categories for business income and deductible expenses and make sure to categorize those expenses when I enter them throughout the year. At the end of the year I just print out a category report and I have my numbers.
1841,yes/no,B000QO76HU,"Can you print reports, etc?",Y,"Yes, reports can be printed. The graphs and the transactions."
1842,yes/no,B000QO76HU,I use computer checks with Microsoft Money. Does YNAB have the capabilities to print checks?,N,"No and that's not a feature I see them offering anytime soon. YNAB is first and foremost a budgeting methodology and the software helps its users to budget accordingly. While it has several nice features, they are all focused on the core of the software's purpose: the budget."

1846,yes/no,B000QO76HU,Does this disk come with the License Key number?,?,I actually downloaded from their website and the whole process is online. There was no disk.

1856,open-ended,B000RAASFK,Do I need Topo maps: Do I need to buy the maps or are the ones that came with it good enough?,,"For 2 years I have been using a 60CSx for geocaching using just the base maps that came with the unit. My biggest complaint is that there are too few details on the original base maps. Only major roads are shown and there is no indication of topography. Using the original base maps I usually must map out the way to a cache online before I head out. This has been working for me so far, but I have finally decided to upgrade to topo maps to make navigation to a cache easier as well as having road information when traveling. Overall, they're not necessary, but they sure are nice to have!"
1857,open-ended,B000RAASFK,I am wondering if this shows bottom contours of inland lakes and rivers?,,"Frm what I can see, it does,but only in a generic way. I caution against buying this upgrade tho. I had nothing but problems with my Garmin after I upgraded to this 2008 update. I ended up buying a newer model, and Wada uite frankly, I am not too happy with that either. I have been relying on AAA maps for the past year. Good luck."
1858,open-ended,B000RAASFK,mountain biking? anyone know of a good gps product for mountain biking....finding direction/elevation and saving trails?,,"I'm a Mac user and mountain biker. I use a Garmin GPSMAP 60scx handheld with Garmin's MapSource Topo US maps. I carry the GPS with me in my pack and turn on the tracking when I'm in unknown territory or exploring new trails. This enables me to see and decide if I should turn left/right or turn around when I meet up with some road or other trail. Since it's showing a 1:100,000 topo, I can see contour lines. Later I can review the tracks I made and find my total ascent/decent and review a profile of elevation change by distance. I can save the track on the GPS and upload it to my Mac to share with other GPS equipped riders. Using the TOPO US on my Mac, I can also find trails that might be suitable for later explorations. Plot a route over the trail and then transfer the route to my GPS so that I can find and follow the trail while in the field. Sometimes however, the trail shown on the map no longer really exists since the digitized topo map is based on older topos and nature tends to grow over trails that have not been maintained or were purposely closed. The GPS has really enhanced my ability to explore and discover new riding terrain. If it did as much for my strength and endurance as it has for my field orientation and ability to know where to go, I'd really be krankin up and down everything! Hope this helps. Paul"
1859,open-ended,B000RLQNR6,chroma green screen: how does this product's chroma feature work (if at all)?,,I found the chroma keying feature to be excellent.

1862,open-ended,B000SKZHM8,"Are there any ""real"" improvements in this year's version? Does that hold true again this year?",,"I've been a money user since the early days and I think these yearly updates have rarely added anything new (except maybe early 2000). I would say that you're wasting money especially if you're not using the automatic statement/balance downloads from your bank. I've never used the feature, but I do have a couple of mutual funds/stocks stored in Money and it does a good job of updated them automatically. The only thing is that these features have to be renewed through software upgrades/purchases about every two years or else you have to input the data manually. I'm currently using Money 2006 and recently tried Money Plus. I really didn't see anything significant except maybe the program startup time. It continued to display the same erroneous data as my current version. Ex. How many time do I have to tell a piece of software that I pay my entire credit card balance every month? Then when I go in the bills summary, it reflects an amount that isn't consistent with the actual account balance. Is that worth paying $45+ for a new piece of software? I really don't think so. What I will never understand is why can't MS publish something a little more detailed information(like Intel when they release new BIOS versions) to let us know what they did. I think it's because they didn't fix very much in the past 12 months since the last release. What they are doing is charging you money for new versions that may have corrected some (not all) bugs. That's garbage--they should release patches like Quicken does when there is something important. Just my 2cents."

After not being able to reach Microsoft (it was Sunday) I did some web research and found the cause and the cure. This worked perfectly for me. Here's the scoop: The Problem: When entering the activation key for Money Plus, there are a number of boxes which allow you to put in the code. If you find that you can only enter four digits instead of five in the activation code fields, this is because you are using large fonts on your Windows system. To workaround this, perform one of the following options: * Change the font size to the normal (default) size. This can be done through the Windows control panel or by right clicking the desktop and selecting the appropriate option (Personalize in Vista). You should refer to Windows Help for more information here. * Alternatively, copy the full activation key and paste into the Activation dialog box. Include the dashes If your key is a 'physical' one, for example coming in a CD box, then the second option can be achieved by typing into another program, such as WordPad or NotePad, and then copy/pasting."

I'm in the same boat, I want to upgrade over 2007 and wanted a hard copy but it looks like the rebate might not be available via amazon."

Lousy interface, not possible to work with different currencies etc."

FTM 2008 Basic is 1 month; FTM 2008 Deluxe is 3 months; FTM 2008 Platinum is 6 months. Now, if this full access to EVERYTHING (don't know if it is but since it says premium access, I would think so) I pay $300 a year for full access to both US and International records. If the premium access is limited to just the US, it's still $180 a year. Therefore, FTM 2008 Platinum, with the current rebate offered, is a great deal for 6 months free access that is worth anywhere between $90 to $150 in REAL dollars! And believe me, with access to those billions of records at Ancestry's web site, you are guaranteed to find many of your ancestors! I would jump at this deal if I could, but I already have a yearly subscription and I'm using FTM 2008."

1876,yes/no,B000SSNLIM,can this be used to switch a xp laptop to vista?,N,No.. You need a Mircosoft Upgrade Windows from XP to Vista. Not just Mircosoft Windows Vista itself. It is pretty simple to upgrade from XP and just follow the screen directions.

There is a more cost-effective license however - the Home License Upgrade. This license allows you to install and run FolderClone on an unlimited number of computers in your home for an additional small amount. After you purchase a single user license, you might be offered this upgrade automatically as part of the documentation you receive with your purchase.

So you probably were sucessful as I was in two cases first getting the updates installed and two getting ripped off by Garmin see my rating and discussion. Good Luck.
1898,open-ended,B000TZFL3M,A newer version has been released ... Why is Amazon still selling this old version?,,"I emailed Garmin about the 2009 map updates, and getting them free as well since you purchased one now with the obsolete maps on it. This is what they had to say. Thank you for contacting Garmin International. Our newest version of mapping software was released in May of 2007. The title of this update is City Navigator NT 2008. Map updates are released every 12 - 15 months. You can probably expect our next map update to be released sometime in the Summer of 2008. To check for this update please log onto our website www.garmin.com and click on ""MAPS"" at the top of the page. The next screen will show ""MAP UPDATES"", please click on it. This will allow you to type in your 'serial number' in the search field. Type in your serial number and click on 'Find'. This will display your mapping update if there is one to order. If nothing displays this will indicate that your Garmin is already fully up to date. If a map update displays you will also notice there is a link that should allow you to register your product to receive this at no cost. If this is an option your first mapping update will be at no charge. ** Keep in mind for the future, map updates are at a cost. ** Map update can be ordered online from our website www.garmin.com, over the phone at 1.800.800.1020, or in local retail store like Best Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart etc. The cost for this update is generally around $75.00 to order. This will be a DVD formatted software disk that will be able to load to your computer. You will need a USB cable to connect your Garmin to the computer for the update to complete. This process is said to take around 45 minutes. This update will give your Garmin device updates on streets, highways, construction, restaurants etc. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns regarding this update"
1899,open-ended,B000TZFL3M,"Update erases your saved sites: Can't these be loaded onto the PC that's needed for the update and then reloaded, or at LEAST warn customers to write a list of sites to re-enter before erasing it all?",,"That sounds strange. I have updated many Garmin GPS's and it never loses the favorites, etc."
1900,yes/no,B000U0I11A,Will this work on Windows 7 Home Premium,?,I use it with Vista - I think it would be fine with windows 7 too.
1901,open-ended,B000U0I11A,Is Quicken 2008 Deluxe compatible with Vista Home edition? Question: Is Quicken 2008 supported by Vista home edition?,,"Yes, according to the Quicken website."
1902,yes/no,B000U0I11A,I'm using a quicken version from 2001. Will this allow me to import data from that version?,N,Do not know
1903,yes/no,B000U0I11A,Will I be able to print personal check?,Y,"Yes, if you have the kind of checks that fit your printer."
1904,open-ended,B000U0I11A,What is compatable with windows 8?,,Yes
1905,yes/no,B000U0I11A,Is Quicken 2008 Deluxe compatible with Windows 7?,Y,Yes it is
1906,open-ended,B000U0I11A,"Is it compatable with windows 8? Also, is there a downloadable version?",,No it's not
1907,yes/no,B000U0I11A,I just got my copy and it was only the disk. Do I need a license for this?,?,No it was the original CD and installed just fine. No number like MS Office or something like that needed when installing.
1908,open-ended,B000U818N0,"Are you getting scammed out of the rebate too? I see with the rainfly up, the screens are exposed, do they zip up for privacy?",,"I, too, got the ""non-compliance"" postcard for the $65 rebate for this product. They claim that ""Your submissions does not include the Original red and white Kaspersky 'K' label"". I followed the rebate instructions to the letter, and included exactly what they required. I double checked everything before sealing the envelope and specifically remember including the red and white K that I cut out from the box. Learning that several other people are having the exact SAME issue with this rebate seems very suspicious, and I want to see this situation corrected."
1909,open-ended,B000U818N0,"How long is the license good for? This item says that it's a 3-user package, but no where in the description it says anything regarding the period of the license, should we buy the license separately..???",,"When you buy the retail box, it includes 1-yr license. Thats 1-yr for each computer that you install it onto. Instead of paying the renewal fee, it would likely be cheaper to buy it again next year when new rebates come out (they almost always come out) which make it free after-rebate (like it is now)."
1910,open-ended,B000U818N0,What is Considered an Original Sales Receipt if I bought it on Amazon? What the heck do I use for a sales receipt since I purchased thius on Amazon?,,"Spoke with amazon customer service; they said to go to orders; click on specific order number then click on print invoice; what appears is what's titled ""Final Details for Order #002-8441476-xxxxxxx"" and contains item, payment, and payment method. They say this is their sales receipt."
1911,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,Serial number for VMware Fusion: Does anyone know where to look for the serial number on the CD?,,"My serial number was on a sticker on the back of the cd sleeve. If yours isn't there, maybe they stuck it somewhere else or maybe it's missing."
1912,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,What version of Fusion is Amazon currently shipping? Is there an updated version that goes with Leopard?,,"It doesn't really matter what version they ship. Just download the latest version, install it, and register with the key that comes in the box."
1913,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,"Parallels vs VMware Fusion to run Adobe CS3: Does anyone have experience of running pc based CS3 software (especially Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Flash and also Corel Painter) with Parallels or VMware Fusion?",,"Eileen: Call up Adobe and let them know that you switched from Windows to a Mac and wish to switch your Adobe software to the Mac version. When I made the switch, I called them up and they sent me out the Mac versions of my Photoshop CS2 and Photoshop Essentials at no charge (I may have had to pay shipping). It was a one-time offer... in other words, I could not switch back (for free) if I later decided I wanted to switch back to the Windows version again. This was about a 1 1/2 years ago, and I'm not sure if they still offer this option. I wish that Adobe would release a single box containing both the Windows and Mac versions of their software, like they did with Lightroom."
1914,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,PC Games: Does VMWare supports PC games like battlefield?,,I would not recommend it. I tried Call of Duty on Vista Ultimate on a VMware Fusion partition and it would not run at all - even with an iMac 2.8 GHz and 4 GB of ram. I also tried some less video card intensive games - Age of Empires and Command and Conquer and they pretty much bombed out as well. I suspect it is the VMware video drivers as you can only use their Direct X in emulation. If you do Bootcamp and load up XP or Vista the games will probably run faster than on your PC - that was my ultimate solution. As I understand it Parallels has the same problems. Hope this helps.
1915,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,"Parallels or VMWare Fusion? So, what would you go with?",,"The only reason I chose Fusion was that it had much better support than Parallels. If you have trouble, Fusion gets back to you. Parallels does not. Although, Parallels may have changed its tune since then, so you may want to do a little more research."
1916,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,i can't install it on my mac,,What year is your Mac? This version can only be use on pre-2008 Macs.
1917,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,VMware Fusion Multilanguage? Is the VMware Fusion a Multilanguage Version?,,"VMware Fusion 2.0 (out now, a free upgrade from 1.0) is multilanguage. 2.0 includes a Spanish language version. (1.0 included French, German, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese, and 2.0 added Spanish and Italian.)"
1918,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,Unity doesn't work: Could that be why I can't run unity?,,"Yes, the current 1.1 upgrade is free for 1.0 users. Hope it remains free though :) But I can imagine they want you to pay after they ported all the nifty features from VMware Workstation."
1919,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,$30 competitive rebate here? Is it possible to get the $30 competitive rebate if I buy this from Amazon?,,"If you click on the 'Rebate' link in the product info, you will see a link to the rebate form PDF from Smith Micro. The one form gives you both options - either the $20 standard rebate or the $30 competitive rebate."
1920,open-ended,B000UK3GVA,Can you create a Boot Camp partition AFTER making a Fusion VM? and then re-install it using Boot Camp?,,"You actually have to wipe the windows partition, then re install windows. Im not sure how, but I was on apples website and there was a forum about how to delet boot camp partitions. and then restore them to the mac side so you can do it again."
1921,yes/no,B000UKBIEC,Can PhotoShop 6 be loaded onto Windows 8.1?,?,Not on my Toshiba laptop. have tried but it crashed every time Len Matthews
1922,open-ended,B000UKBIEC,Vista and Photoshop Elements 6: Is anyone using it that does not have problems?,,"It depends on which processor chip you have in your machine... if you have a 32-bit chip then Elements 6 has a 32-bit Vista version available now. However, if you are one of those with a new 64-bit system then Elements 6 does not have a Vista compatable version yet."
1923,open-ended,B000UKBIEC,Rebate? Did anyone who bought this get the rebate form in the box?,,"You can get the form at http://clientimages.cpginc.com/logo/forms/adobe/PhotoShopElements6.pdf. The form actually requires proof of ownership of some competing product, but one of the listed products is Google Picasa, which is free. Not a real high bar they're setting."
1924,open-ended,B000UKBIEC,Photoshop Elements 6 VS Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo X2: Anyone know what the differences are?,,"To Pat and J.Crosby, In my opinion, do youself a favour and don't go anywhere near Photoshop Elements 6 (PSE6). I paid for an upgrade from an earlier version and have wasted my money. The program crashes continually to such an extent it is unusable. From my googling on the internet this is the experience of numerous other people. There are no solutions I can find on the Adobe site and although these complaints seem to have been posted since PSE6 was first brought out there are no upgrades or patches to fix what are a myriad of problems. A number of people have complained that the program worked initially and then started continually crashing and that has been my experience. I won't be buying more Adobe products until they show a bit of customer care and isuue fixes for this mess. I have downloaded and installed a trial version of Pro Photo X2 and so far it seems stable. PSE6 may have more bells and whistles but that is not much use if they are unusable due to continual program crashes."
1925,open-ended,B000UKBIEC,repairing droopy lid in an image: Can anyone please offer advise on how I can do this using this program?,,"I would try the ""Liquify"" filter. Look under ""filter"" then ""distort"". A great Elements forum can be found here: http://www.elementsvillage.com/forums/index.php"
1926,open-ended,B000UKBIEC,I have Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 and am thinking of upgrading. Which version do you suggest? Should I anticipate any problems?,,"That depends on a lot of other parameters. What Windows version are you using, what are your needs, and others. I happen to use XP and design graphics mainly for website use, so I went back to 6 after trying both 8 and 10. It does everything I need very well."
1927,open-ended,B000UKBIEC,Black and White with one colored object? Will this program allow you to take a black and white photo and then make one object colored?,,"Yes, previous versions did. I believe you use layers and layer masks to create the effect. One layer is colored, with a black and white copy layer on top. Then just erase the parts of the black and white layer that are over the bouquet."
1928,open-ended,B000UKBIEC,"Problems with Photoshop 6? What gives, have I just been lucky?",,"Well, I upgraded to PSE 6.0 from PSE 5.0 a few months ago, really without thinking about it. I just wanted the latest software. Unfortunately, I have had quite a few problems relating to the uploading of RAW files, i.e., the program doesn't seem to be able to handle them. After I've uploaded them from the built-in card reader in my PC (running Windows XP), the thumbnails in the Organizer appear as ""broken links"" and usually the program crashes shortly thereafter. I've seen complaints about this on various forums but Adobe seems apparently unable or unwilling to do anything about it at this point. It does seem to be limited to this one feature (i.e., uploading .CR2 files) but that is a drag because that is the format I usually shoot in. Otherwise, it's a terrific program. It certainly has lots of great features. But I'm spending too much time trying to keep it running. I should have stuck with PSE 5.0 until Adobe came out with some fixes for this."
1929,yes/no,B000UKBIEC,"Confused by system requirements: Here's the question for owners of Photoshop Elements 5 or 6, does it really require you to have a low resolution monitor?",Y,"Your monitor needs to run at exactly 96 dpi -- if you run it at a higher dpi, a bug in PSE 6 prevents the menus from displaying properly! See this Adobe knowledgebase article: http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb402728&sliceId=1 This leaves two unsatisfactory choices: a) Reduce your dpi to 96 and live with the hard-to-read small menu fonts. b) Reduce the screen resolution to less than 1680x1050 and live with the fuzziness and reduced sharpness of text and photos. Adobe screwed this up, given how many people have high-resolution displays, especially the new laptops."
1930,open-ended,B000UKBIEC,Installing Photoshop on a second machine: Is there a way to copy the program onto my laptop?,,"You can * burn it to a disc * copy it to a jump/usb drive * if your computers are networked you can access it from your laptop * failing the above, you can download it to your laptop"

1934,yes/no,B000V0CT9Y,will this software play blu-ray movies?,Y,"According to Dell, Yes. Dell Cyberlink PowerDVD versions 8.x & 9.x will play BluRay source: http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?docid=475725&DoNotRedirect=y A word of warning.

You can argue that anti-virus should be included for free, but thats never going to happen. You can also only have one anti-virus running at a time.

Leave them. I rebooted after uninstalling the Norton. Then I installed Windows Live OneCare and then rebooted. It is fast and does everything simply. I would imagine that you should uninstall SpyBot the same way. One program at a time. Windows Live OneCare is BETTER than SpyBot. I'm really happy - let me know how it goes! martyhogan@sbcglobal.net"

Be aware, though, that Microsoft has announced that will discontinue retail sales of Windows Live OneCare subscription service, effective June 30th, 2009. They are working on a move to provide a free anti-virus software application, code-named ""Morro"" which is designed to offer comprehensive protection from various forms of malicious software, including viruses, spyware, rootkits and trojans, by focusing on a smaller footprint that uses fewer computing resources. Until the day that the software with the code-name of ""Morro"" becomes available for testing, I'll stick with Windows Live OneCare, not just because of the amazing new low prices, but because it works."

Leave them. I rebooted after uninstalling the Norton. Then I installed Windows Live OneCare and then rebooted. It is fast and does everything simply. I would imagine that you should uninstall SpyBot the same way. One program at a time. Windows Live OneCare is BETTER than SpyBot. I'm really happy - let me know how it goes! martyhogan@sbcglobal.net"

Be aware, though, that Microsoft has announced that will discontinue retail sales of Windows Live OneCare subscription service, effective June 30th, 2009. They are working on a move to provide a free anti-virus software application, code-named ""Morro"" which is designed to offer comprehensive protection from various forms of malicious software, including viruses, spyware, rootkits and trojans, by focusing on a smaller footprint that uses fewer computing resources. Until the day that the software with the code-name of ""Morro"" becomes available for testing, I'll stick with Windows Live OneCare, not just because of the amazing new low prices, but because it works."

Shouldn't this be included in all PC's when purchased?,,"Anti-Virus software has always been seperate, the fact that this is made by Microsoft makes no difference. It will never come included with the OS because Microsoft would be accused of using their monopoly to force their anti-virus on users. You can argue that anti-virus should be included for free, but thats never going to happen. You can also only have one anti-virus running at a time. However this is actualy a rip off for a different reason. They are discontinuing the service in June so its a waist of money. Buy NOD32 or Kaspersky instead (I don't trust Norton and Mcafee)"

Does buying this product allow me to easily renew my subscription for one year?,,"A call to the OneCare Help Desk confirmed that you can renew by entering a new product key. I did purchase Windows OneCare from Amazon.com at a substantial savings. When you go to renew your subscription there is a screen that gives you the option to enter a prepaid PIN. By inserting the product key, your subscription is renewed immediately.

1986,open-ended,B000VJTL1Y,"Why my PSPx2 won't install, I get Error Verify I have sufficient privileges to start system service?",,"PSPx2 is full of bugs. Corel should send you a new copy, on their dime. I have had crashes and frozen screens on PSP X and X2. I have given up on it. The problems multiplied in Windows 7, especially 64-bit.

1987,open-ended,B000VJTL1Y,Is this the latest upgrade from Corel Photopaint 9? Just curious if this is the latest upgrade to my current one or if this is better than what I am using?,,"And to amplify the previous response a little, Paint Shop Pro (PSP) was for many years a shareware program, actually the best image editing shareware program available. PSP was purchased by Corel in 2004. PSP is a competitor to Photo Shop Elements, in the same way that Photo Paint is a competitor to Photo Shop. The difference is that Elements is an extract from Photoshop whereas PSP is a completely separate product from Photopaint."

1991,open-ended,B000VJTL1Y,PSP X2 &amp; Windows 7 64 Bit? Will paintshop pro photo x2 work with windows 7 64 bit?,,"I just bought and set up a new PC w/W7 64bit. Had no problems with the online PSPPhotoIII from trial download. I havn't tried my older PSP9 yet because PSPPhoto has all the attributes of the older PSP9, in fact very much like it with a few added photo effect ops. I only know that I emailed another program maker NeatImage to see if I needed the 64bit version for my new W7 PC and he said no. W7 is so new there are some programs that aren't compatible, but you can ask the pc to correct back to a previous machine ie: Vista or XP on that particular program. They are also fdoing updates continuously to W7 to correct any bugs from previous software that isn't compatible yet. And it also depends on what PC you have w/7 on. Apparently HPs have some problems. It's still at the homework stage Jan 2010, but time will tell. I'd email corel or post on their forum."
1992,open-ended,B000VJTL1Y,PSP X2 No Pixel ReSize ??? Does anyone know a way to resize a photo in PSP X2 using pixels?,,"Under Image &gt; Resize, you will see two sets of choices. The second set is where you want to change the ""percent"" to ""pixels"". Hope this helps."
1993,open-ended,B000VJTL1Y,PSP and Vista: Will this new version work with Vista?,,"I'm running PSP Photo X2 under Vista on an HP Slimline with 2 gigs of RAM and I have had no problems. However, I've read about some bad experiences that other people have had running PSP under Vista. I don't know for sure what the problems are, but I'd highly recommend a clean install of the Paint Shop software if at all possible. I'm in the same boat you are with regard to level of expertise (or lack thereof). I do have a lot of photos on my computer and I ran several of my problem photos through PSP Photo X2 and applied the ""quick fix"" button. The photos were all improved considerably with zero effort and knowledge. I'm pretty sure that with a little practice with the more complicated features I could do more. I have also used PCP Photo X2 do so some web graphics, and the support for layers, JPGs, GIFs, PNGs, and the RGB color model are more than sufficient for my needs (I used Photoshop in college and Print Shop works essentially the same way Photoshop did for the tasks I need it to do). I also tried Photoshop Elements, and the web-centric features of Print Shop Pro seemed far more robust to me than the ones in Elements. In my opinion, nothing even comes close to Print Shop Pro for the price. Finally, if you are interested in doing some detailed research before you buy the software, get Diane Koers's book ""Picture Yourself Learning Corel Paint Shop Pro X2"" and read it. It will tell you all the things you can do with the software and it's surprisingly inexpensive, especially for a Course Technology book. The best part is that after you read it and decide to buy the software (which I'm betting you will), the book will continue to be useful to you as a reference."

There is only one version. GIT Corp's licensing deal with the Lampoon ended a few years back, so presumably no new COPIES of this DVD, let alone VERSIONS, will be produced by GIT Corp. My assumption is that ""old version"" in this case means ""out of print."" Three years ago, remaindered copies could be bought for $15; now those are getting more scarce, so their price, one assumes, will only go upward."

I used Free Tax USA for the first time (previously with Turbo Tax) and have a Masters in Tax (so I think I know what I am talking about) and found both products very similar. Turbo Tax has a few more bells but if your return is fairly straight foreword, save the money and go with Free Tax USA. Brian"
2000,open-ended,B000W3RSGE,"Turbo Tax vs Tax Act: I've always used Turbo Tax before, but for that price difference why wouldn't I go with Tax Act?",,"A little perspective on electronic filing of federal returns: In 2006, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on electronic filing (you can watch the hearing on the committee's website). Among those testifying were Nina Olsen, the IRS's Taxpayer Advocate. Olsen stressed that the ""freefile alliance"" of corporate tax companies and the IRS had failed to encourage sufficient taxpayer use of electronic filing, and strongly recommended the IRS establish a web portal with a simple electronic template to allow individual taxpayers to file online for free, without having to go through a ""freefile alliance"" company. Then-chairman Grassley and ranking member Baucus (now chairman) both supported Olsen's proposal. Subsequently, the two directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO, Congress's investigative arm) to research Olsen's proposal. The GAO report came out last year. It noted the experiences of some U.S. states and some foreign countries in establishing government-run electronic portals for tax filing. The GAO report concluded that if done properly, a government-run portal could be effective in encouraging more taxpayers to file electronically. What did the current IRS commissioner do upon receiving the report and being required to comment? He simply noted the report's conclusions and made no indication of what the IRS might do to establish its own portal. I think the bottom line is clear: the IRS under the Bush administration is in bed with the tax-preparation industry, obviously due in part to the pressure put on the IRS by Congressmen in the pocket of that industry. It will no doubt require a new administration to give all taxpayers the unrestricted right to file electronically. Until then, we who wish to file electronically for free have to navigate the thicket of pricing schemes and plans thrown up by the tax-preparation industry. This year, I'm pleased to note, TaxACT enables anyone (regardless of income) to download its standard federal IRS software AND file for free! (although you have to constantly click ""no"" to ad after ad asking you to ""upgrade"" to a paid version). And as for state returns, many state tax authorities maintain electronic portals enabling individuals to file their state returns for free, such as my state of Virginia. As many of you know, filing a state return is vastly simpler than a federal return, since states rely on just a few pieces of information from your federal return. Pay a company 15, 20, or 25 bucks to file my state return when I can do it for FREE in ten minutes? No way!"
2001,open-ended,B000W3RSGE,On Line vs. CD Versions: Can you file multiple returns using the on line version of Turbo Tax?,,"With TurboTax Online you have to use a separate user ID for each federal return that you file, which means you have to pay separately for each one. If you have to file for multiple family members, the CD version will cost less. With TurboTax Online, since each federal return is a separate account, you also have to purchase the state separately for each person. If one person has to file in two states, you have to purchase both states for that person. With the CD version you purchase each state once, and you can use it for as many people as need it. For example, if you live in New York, and some family members work in New Jersey, you would purchase one copy of New York and one copy of New Jersey. You would use the one New York program for everyone, and the one New Jersey program for all those who need it. If you buy the Federal + State product, the first state is included at no extra charge, so you only have to buy another state if you need a different state. Again, if you are filing for multiple family members, the CD version is going to cost less."
2002,yes/no,B000W3RSGE,Capital gains: Do I understand correctly that if you sold shares of stock &amp; have to report a capital gain that you can't use Turbo tax deluxe but have to go to the Premier version?,Y,"TurboTax Deluxe will work fine for you if you have capital gains transactions (including stock and mutual funds). TurboTax Premier has more help and guidance (like lot sales, ESPP, stock options, automated cost basis) for these types of transactions than Deluxe. If you have fairly straightforward stock/mutual fund transactions, Deluxe is great. Bob Meighan VP, TurboTax"

2006,open-ended,B000W3RSGE,foreign earned income: Does Turbo Tax support filing for deductions for foreign earned income?,,"Thanks Bob for the explaination. I got it this time. The interview title within the ""Less Common Income"" is kind of misleading; The ""foreign earned income"" is really means ""foreign earned income exlusion"", because I don't have any exclusion, that's why everytime I went through the interview, it just delete the form 2555, and didn't give me any chance to input the ""foreign wage""; After I went into the ""Miscellaneous income"", I did able to see the ""foreign wage"" can be inputed; I think most of other people will have similar issue as me......Even if they do have ""foreigh earned income exlusion"", they will still be stuck at the ""foreign earned income (exclusion)"" because they are not able to input income here and they don't know there is a ""foreign wage"" input two level deep under the ""Miscellaneous income""......

While I really like the aesthetics and presentation, Pages isn't nearly as good as word for just plain typing. Pages is much, much better than word at page layout, with much better templates and a more user friendly interface, but it isn't that great for writing essays or reports. The spell check is much weaker on Pages, and it misses a lot of simple grammer things that Word automatically corrects, and also a personal issue I have with it is that its default font is Helvetica. Who uses Helvetica? Every time I make a new document I have to readjust the font, which can be a little annoying. Keynote is better than powerpoint, though, in pretty much every way. Numbers is much easier to use than excel, but has much fewer formulas and functions than excel which is pretty important. So, the new release of office is significant because MS has been doing it for a while. Apple's new iwork is better than earlier versions, and is better than office at certain things, but as overall it still isn't equal to office."

2049,yes/no,B000XSHKCA,"Does this have ""Event Minder"" in it?",?,I do not know what Event Minder is but the program has an Event Planner in it and I use it all the time. I am so happy with my Hallmark Card Program and especially since I am able to put personal pictures on any card too.
2050,yes/no,B000XSHKCA,will this work on windows 7,Y,"Hi Mary, The program was designed to run on Vista which was really the early version of Windows 7, so the answer is yes, it will work on Windows 7. Best regards, Jay"

2056,yes/no,B000XYP24M,Does this software work with Windows 8,N,Karen I don't know. I have not used the software at all. I bought only for the cards.
2057,yes/no,B000Z3DXT2,"Hi, I have a 2013 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.8.5, will this older version of Final Cut Express still install/run on with my computer? Thanks.",?,"I have the latest Mac Book Pro - retina display included- with the latest system to date. I received the software today, and I installed it in my Mac Pro. The system identified it with easy, and also accomplished the installation the same way. It will tell you that it will check if the software is acceptable for your computer system, but don't worry, because, at least in my case, the computer was capable of doing the installation successfully. I opened up or ran the program after the installation, just in case it could not be able to run. But it was displayed with easy, and although I did not use it, it looks like it is able to function, because it showed a window asking me about which kind of video or video system I was about to use, I accepted the one selected by default, just looking what will happen, and it told me it did not detected a fire wire, and asked me if it should continue, opening its main window; I approved continuing running the program, and it opened its main window. The User Manual should be duplicated and saved, some where in your Mac. It is on the file that has all the files of the installation package. I can not asure you the program will work to the perfection inside your Mac, because I haven't gone so far using it, but at least you have part of your question answered - it can be installed in your Mac Book Pro, and somehow it runs. My Mac Book Pro computer is using actually OS X Version 10.9.1"
2058,open-ended,B000Z3DXT2,"i am looking for a program that allows me to lay tracks to a photo slide show. also, i am hoping to be able to export in one program",,"I have not used this software in years, switched to Adobe Premiere. I suggest going to the official final cut software website and inquiring."
2059,open-ended,B000Z3DXT2,"Apple store vs. Amazon: Can somebody explain me why is it cheaper to buy FCE 4 in amazon than in apple store, it just doesn't make any sense to me.",,"It's because Apple rarely offers discounts. Think about it...Apple's Itunes charges ""hit songs"" for $1.29 instead of $.99 or $1.00 like Amazon and almost any other online store. Also, the only time Apple has a sale from my knowledge is black friday. And for how much? Like 10% ($1,199 macbook pro is discounted by $110 cheaper on black friday). The only other time Apple gives something back to their customers is their offers when you buy things like a computer (ex: we will throw in a free ipod touch or give you $50 off if you're a student)...big deal when you are paying that kind of money. Apple products are almost always cheaper online through other sites. Don't get me wrong, I love Apple's products but I don't love how they manage their sales. I realize you can debate about you are paying for what you get, but I disagree how apple never offers discounts when other company's do."
2060,yes/no,B000Z3DXT2,Does this product have an unused license?,Y,"Yes it does but to be honest I was planning on getting a new mac so I'm probably going to take it off my selling list when I get home, sorry for any inconvenience"
2061,yes/no,B000Z3DXT2,Is it a stand alone software for movies?,?,This is stand alone software to edit video. You can make movies with it. You cannot burn dvds with it.
2062,open-ended,B000Z3DXT2,I have a MacBook Pro 3.1 OS X 10.6.3 Will this version install?,,I put it on a Mac book Pro built around 2008. Should be some specs on the Internet.
2063,open-ended,B000Z3DXT2,can i make photo slideshow using this software? or is this only for videos?,,"You should be able to do so but it would be unnecessarily complicated. I'm certain there are better softwares for such thing, AfterEffects would be a better option but also complicated for something simple. Whatever built-in software that comes with OSX these days is likely your best best. Would not recommend FCX/FCP for just a slideshow."
2064,yes/no,B000Z3DXT2,will I be able to burn a dvd that is playable on my dvd player with this software?,?,"Yes, but this software is not very easy to use. The instruction manual is over 1,300 pages long -- no kidding. It doesn't really live up to the Apple promise in their TV spots of making tasks like this intuitive and easy. Steep learning curve but you can make DVDs that will play on your player."
2065,open-ended,B000Z3DXT2,adobe affects vs Final Cut Express or Final Cut Studio: Does Final Cut Express have similar or better compositing features than Adobe After Effects?,,"Adobe After Effects is a program that was developed for all kinds of 2D and 3D compositions and effects. It is very powerful, and FCE can't do what it does. You are supposed to develop your compositions in AE and export them to FCE. FCE does a great job of putting things together and generating the final output."
2066,yes/no,B000Z3DXT2,Is there video editing software comparable to FCE in price and functionality for Windows?,?,You could try Adobe Premiere Elements. The newest version does just about everything FCE does and more.
2067,yes/no,B000Z3GSXK,Can I run this program if my computer has a PCI bus graphics card?,?,"You should be able to. I run Final Cut Express 4 on a MacPro, OS 10.6.8, with an ATI Radeon HD 2600 PCI card."
2068,yes/no,B000Z3GSXK,I have Final Cut Express HD 3.5. I installed it years ago and do not know where to find my license number/serial number. Can I still install this upgr,N,"if the original installation is a full version and is still is on your computer and can launch by itself then you do not need the original key. However, if the original 3.5 application is nor a full version and cannot be launched then you need your original key."
2069,open-ended,B000Z3GSXK,I have FCE2 &amp; license key but not installed (MAC 10.6.8). Will FCE4 upgrade install fully with my FCE2 key or MUST FCE2 be installed first?,,I can't recall but I don't think so. You may have to enter the FCE2 key to authorize the upgrade.
2070,yes/no,B000Z3GSXK,will it run on mavericks?,Y,"Yes, I'm running it on a 2008 unibody MacBook with Mavericks. Works great."

2072,yes/no,B000Z3GSXK,Will this version of Final Cut work with the Macbook Pro Mac OS 10.6.8? Thanks,Y,"Yes, Final Cut Express 4 will work with Mac OS 10.6.8. I am Final Cut Express 4.0.1 on 10.6.8 on a MacPro with no problems. I have not used it on a Macbook, but I can't see why there would be any difficulty."
2073,yes/no,B000Z3GSXK,Do you have to already have final cut pro to use this software?,?,"There is a BIG difference between ""Final Cut Express"" and ""Final Cut Pro"". Final Cut Express is a discontinued software from Apple and yes, you do need it to run this upgrade. Final Cut Pro would not work with this upgrade, nor would you need it."
2074,open-ended,B00111BQ28,what is the annual cost?,,You can renew for 19.95 if you renew from the update pop up in the task bar.
2075,open-ended,B00111BQ28,Excuse me pls what is the activation code for the system mechanic 12 ?,,"When you buy it, they should send to you an email from: orders@iolo.com. It contains a 5+5+10 alphanumerical code (not case sensitive), such as: 12E45-67F89-10123GH45IJ."
2076,yes/no,B00111BQ28,Can use with windows 8.1?,N,iolo site says Win 8. Not specific re; 8.1 but one would think 8.1 would work as well.
2077,open-ended,B00111BQ28,"Is this the latest version, as of 7/2014? It says windows XP..will this update regularly as well? thanks!",,"Just checked and I'm currently on Sys Mech Pro version 12.7.1.2 Depending on what product you buy, it should automatically update you to the latest version during your 12-month purchase period."

2080,open-ended,B00111A1BU,Where is the serial number for this product ? I loaded the disk and it asked for the Activation key and I did find it. After entering it I was asked for the serial number. It was suppose to be on the box but it is not. Customer support wants to go into...,,Personally I don't have a problem with a major company accessing my computer while I watch. The activation key may be on the snap case which held the CD. Did you look there?
2081,open-ended,B00111A1BU,What about putting the old drive into a HD enclosure and treating it as an external drive on your good computer? Won't that work?,,I would think that would work. I if the machine cannot connect to the internet you cannot activate the software.
2082,open-ended,B00111A1BU,install,,"Attempted to use the software, but was unsuccessful. I got no really help from the company's technical support. You may get it to do what you're attempting to do, but it did not work for me."
2083,open-ended,B00112GBOU,Looking for an easy program to use to create posters but only have a DIAL UP internet connection. Are templates/clip art are on the CD -vs- online?,,On cd. You're good. I like it

It will check your drivers to make sure they are all up to date and reccoamend a download if required. You cannot go wrong wit Iola, it's the best on todays wide market place."
2090,open-ended,B0011E82PE,"What means old version? Seems to me, vesion14 is new version. Thanks, Leonid",,"I think what they are saying is the ""Old Version 14"" supports 3 computers and the new version has no limit for the same person."

2093,yes/no,B0011E82PE,"Should I use this product after I have used Glary Utilities, CCleaner, WinASO Registry Optimizer &amp; Free Window Registry Repair on my PC?",?,"I have been using System Mechanic on my Vista and Windows 8 operating systems. I have never had any problems with either my Laptop or PC since using System mechanic. I can recommend it. I think system mechanic is better than the others in that is does a lot more than just repair the registry. To enjoy the benefit of any product of this nature, you need to run it at least once week which is no problem. (you can set it run automatically for a number of different functions if you want) When you are away from the pc, run scan, with automatic fix options, repack files etc. When you get back from cooking or whatever else you were doing its like new again. Works for me. A fantastic product. In 5 years I have not had to get any outside help with my machines. System Mechanic does it all for me."

However, the newer version PE8 needs an intel mac. Hope this helps, Andy"
2099,open-ended,B0012LMQFI,Pop Color Option? Does anyone know if this software allows you to use a Pop Color option?,,You might want to take a look at this article: http://www.pcworld.com/article/138288/make_your_photos_pop_with_color.html It's for the PC but think it should work with the Mac version.

I know this isn't Nero and maybe I should opt for Nero 8, but with all the bloatware and extras involved in nero i'd like to have some other software that burns cd's/dvd's etc and software...",,"And the answer is: yeah, sorta, kinda, maybe. Being curious, I tried to do it. First you have to save the video into a format VideoStudio 11.5+ can recognize. I initially tried saving as .avi through Zamzar but VS 11.5+ couldn't read it. Adobe Premiere Elements could read it. I then tried saving in .mov format and VS 11.5+ could open and read it but when I tried to burn a regular DVD, it produced a glitchy video. The opening and closing sections were good. It probably would work, just have to experiment a little."
2112,yes/no,B0013OAHTG,Can you use this program on multiple computers?,Y,"I'm pretty sure the answer is ""No"" because it makes you get a registration key and register your computer, unlike some other Corel software I have used. I may try it anyway and post back here with a definite answer."
2113,open-ended,B0014X2UAK,amazon price vs. Apple store price? Why is there such a huge price difference between amazon and the apple store for iWork?,,"So someone sold you a demo? The full retail iwork comes with a code, did you buy from Amazon or a seller? If from Amazon just do a return."

2119,yes/no,B0014X2UAK,"I have Microsoft Office 2004 Word documents. Will they be useable with this? I have OS 10.8.5 now, will it work with this",?,"Absolutely. I use it to pull in people's Word docs (95-2009) all the time easily. The only issues you'll ever face are if a document has extreme levels of graphs/images/styling/outlining - sometimes those items don't convert perfectly. Most people don't create documents for which that's ever been a problem for me or anyone else in our company, though."
2120,open-ended,B0014X2UAK,iwork vs microsoft word student&amp;office for mac,,I would highly recomend iWork because it cost less and you can do all the things that Microsoft Word does. Since you already have a macbook download the trial version of iWork. If you need further help with your decision watch some comparisons on YouTube. This was how I made up my mind to go with iWork. I realized the Microsoft Word program on Mac is not the same as it is on Windows. Since I'm going to be forced to learn a new program might as well go with iWork since it is affordable and seems to offer more options than Microsoft Word. Seriously look up the videos on YouTube you are going to be impressed with all the things you can do with iWork.
2121,open-ended,B0014X2UAK,Download the Free Trial at Apple's Website: Is it worth the $79.99 just for an upgrade??,,"iWork is great with ppt, vivalarevolution. Only thing is that Keynote is so far advanced beyond PowerPoint so some of the amazing transitions won't carry over. To be perfectly frank, OpenOffice.org sucks compared to MS Office and iWork."

Don't know what you'll use the most, but I needed iMovie and I'm not happy with it. I liked the older version better. But I bought my computer used and it didn't have iLife, so I'm stuck with this one. One of the positives is that it still has iWeb (which I use)."
2126,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,will it work with 10.10.1? I need an up-grade to iWeb,Y,Yes
2127,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,Will it work on OS X 10.6.8?,?,It does for me.

2130,open-ended,B0014X5XEK,Is ilife 9 a stand alone program or an upgrade of previous ilife software?,,If you have an older version of iLife it will replace it. If you don't it will work as a stand alone as well. Great software.
2131,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,Is iLife '09 compatible with OS X version 10.9.4. I am especially interested in using iWeb.,Y,"I have never actually used iWeb however I am using 10.9.4, and I just tried opening iWeb. It started up with no issues. It's ver 3.0.4 so I would say yes based on what I just tried. The rest of my older version iLife apps work fine."
2132,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,"will it work on 10.7.5? my macbook is an updated 2008 version, i want to use Garage Band, iPhoto, and iMovie.",?,I believe I was on Lion or Mountain Lion when I purchased it and put it on my mac.

2135,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,will this work will ibook?,?,"As long as you're running OS 10.5.6, you should be fine. But if you're running an older iLife, I might stay with that. Don't know what you'll use the most, but I needed iMovie and I'm not happy with it. I liked the older version better. But I bought my computer used and it didn't have iLife, so I'm stuck with this one. One of the positives is that it still has iWeb (which I use)."
2136,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,will it work with 10.10.1? I need an up-grade to iWeb,Y,Yes
2137,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,Will it work on OS X 10.6.8?,?,It does for me.

2140,open-ended,B0014X5XEK,Is ilife 9 a stand alone program or an upgrade of previous ilife software?,,If you have an older version of iLife it will replace it. If you don't it will work as a stand alone as well. Great software.
2141,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,Is iLife '09 compatible with OS X version 10.9.4. I am especially interested in using iWeb.,Y,"I have never actually used iWeb however I am using 10.9.4, and I just tried opening iWeb. It started up with no issues. It's ver 3.0.4 so I would say yes based on what I just tried. The rest of my older version iLife apps work fine."
2142,yes/no,B0014X5XEK,"will it work on 10.7.5? my macbook is an updated 2008 version, i want to use Garage Band, iPhoto, and iMovie.",?,I believe I was on Lion or Mountain Lion when I purchased it and put it on my mac.

A word of caution, if your XP software has been corrupted, not allow you to use the upgrade mode and you have to make a clean install you will loose all data etc. Hopefully, you will be successfully upgrading to Vista!

2168,open-ended,B0016P9KWC,Free Garmin Map Update: Who is eligible for a FREE update?,,"Only if you purchased the unit within the past few months. I think it's 6 months but I could be wrong. I was able to get a free update past the deadline the first year, but not now. It bites. Updates should be free since there is so much misinformation in the originial unit I had."
2169,open-ended,B0016P9KWC,Garmin 350: Could I have been given a truck route Garmin?,,You may have toll roads checked off in the avoidances part of the settings.
2170,open-ended,B0016P9KWC,"Can you use the CD on your computer? If updating by buying this CD, can I use this on my computer to add POI's, set up routes, etc?",,"The maps DVD has nothing to do with adding custom POIs. Download ""POI Loader"" from the Garmin web site if you want to do that."
2171,open-ended,B0016P9KWC,Is this the right product if I have no maps to begin with? Is this the right product?,,"Easy to be confused...they don't seem to make it obvious, but yes, Update means that you need to already have a copy. Also for your eTrex, make sure that you buy the non-NT version of City Navigator. The NT version is for the newer units."
2172,yes/no,B0016P9KWC,is this leftime map update,?,"no,it is a one time map update"
2173,yes/no,B0016P9KWC,Is this update compatible with the Nuvi 260?,?,I truely don't know. Although I guess it all depends on wheather or not the connections fit. Some units have the same connetions.
2174,open-ended,B0016P9KWC,Newest Garmin map updates: Anyone know when the updated maps go into newly shipped Nuvis?,,"Good questions...I hope someone can answer them. I just called Garmin support and was told the wait time was 30-35 minutes. If buying a new GPS I'd consider a different brand. Edit: After talking to Garmin, they said if you buy a new Garmin and it does not have the 2010 maps, which are now released, you can get them from Garmin for free when you register your unit, as long as it's done within 60 days. So, you will have the new 2010 maps, no matter what the unit might have on it when you buy it."
2175,open-ended,B0016P9KWC,Updated map for Garmin Streetpilot C330: I assume I just purchase the 2009 North America update?,,"Yes. You can go to the Garmin site and download for approx. $69, or have a lifetime membership for $100, which seems the best way to go."
2176,open-ended,B0016P9KWC,Working with a MAC: Can I use the new mapping on my MAC?,,"I am, at this moment, downloading map update on my Garmin C340 on my Powerbook G4. Takes about an hour doing it online. Anyway, yes, they are now Mac-friendly."
2177,yes/no,B0016P9KWC,"simple question. can i use this dvd for upgrade BMW 740i,year 2001,thanks.",?,"Nope, sorry. Garmin's map updates are completely incompatible with the GPS unit in your car. Besides, if I'm not mistaken, most in-dash GPS units are manufactured by Alpine, Panasonic and the likes. Call your nearest BMW dealer or the BMW USA DVD helpline @ 1-888-NAVMAPS. Remember to update the operating software as well."
2178,open-ended,B0017NWWUA,Is this Latin American or European Spanish?,,It's Latin american.

2180,open-ended,B0017NWWUA,Downloaded VS Physical: Has anyone bought the downloadable version vs the physical version you order??,,"I too would like to know if I buy the electronic downloadable version do I get everything I get with the physical package. For example, will I have the ability to burn the audio CD's so I can listen to those in my car?"
2181,open-ended,B0017NWWUA,How do I transfer audio from Learn to Speak Spanish Deluxe to MP3 player ? I wondered if I had to rip the audio CDs to Windows Media player and then download to MP3 player??,,"The product description indicates it is a computer program on a DVD rather than an Audio CD with tracks you could rip. GG is right that the program, Audacity, plus Lame.dll is probably the best way to convert various things to mp3s. Audacity is free, open source, works well, and under most setups can also record your computer's audio output. Perhaps that's the only way you could extract audio from a program and convert to mp3, but I think it's supposed to be interactive."
2182,open-ended,B0017NWWUA,Does the disc work with MAC or windows only?,,Gave as a gift that was requested. IT was for a Windows system.
2183,open-ended,B0017NWWUA,windows 7?,,yes

2185,yes/no,B0017NWWUA,does this work with Microsoft 2003: is this compatable with microsoft 2003?,Y,I have Microsoft 2003 - and it hasn't caused any problem with the Spanish program (but there is no interaction between them that I know of).
2186,open-ended,B0017NWWUA,Microphone included? Is a mike included?,,No.
2187,open-ended,B0017NWWUA,Does this work on Windows XP? Does anyone know if it will work on Windows XP?,,"Yeah, it's compatible with XP. Make sure you have a DVD drive."
2188,yes/no,B0017U9Q2U,"Does it have the capability to ""fade out"" the edges of an imported photo or art file.",?,"Yes, one of the built-in ""filter effects"" is ""feather"" which can be applied to the edges of an inserted photo to create this result. Applying the effect to smaller images can leave them blurry overall, so it is not as precise a solution as feathering the edges of an image (before insertion) using an actual graphics editing program such as Photoshop or Serif's PhotoPlus -- but the capability is there nevertheless."
2189,open-ended,B0017U9Q2U,"Where is proof of purchase? Does anyone else have this problem, or better yet, does anyone know where the proof of purchase is?",,Californian: The Proof of Purchase of your Serif product must be a dated store receipt or online invoice (photocopy accepted). You should be able to find this within your Amazon.com account. Jeff Serif Employee
2190,yes/no,B0017U9Q2U,Will this product work for creating e-book covers?,Y,"It works great. It has all the design options. I should warn you though that X7 is out--maybe even X8. X3 is no longer supported and you'll be asked to get an update. Serif is an English product, but they love to call. The best thing in a newer version is the ability to cut out pictures automatically."

2194,open-ended,B0018EI3I8,how well does it do with content filtering?,,"After installing this version of KIS my system slowed to a crawl. It would take 10 minutes to boot. After I figured out it was Kaspersky, I removed it and haven't used their products since. At my work with 2000 computers, they use McAfee."
2195,open-ended,B0018EI3I8,"Best Anti-Virus: Many anti-virus has been used, but which one is the best?",,I use Kaspersky Internet Security on my Vista laptop. It works great but at one time for some reason Id get blue screens and Vista said Kaspersky was the cause. What I did was go to the repair-uninstall feature and did the repair and its worked fine since then. I also use nod32. Both Kaspersky and nod32 are very highly rated but I think nod32 is supposed to use less system resources and may be a better choice if you dont have a high performance computer. I found a good deal on nod32 but honestly if you wait and look around you should be able to find Kaspersky for a free after rebate price.
2196,open-ended,B0018EI3I8,does kis 2010 work with vista and ie8? does kis2010 work with vista and ie8?,,"Having had bad experience with Kaspersy before, I would not venture any further. Just getting out of Kaspersy mess takes a day."

2198,yes/no,B0018QV3OC,"I want to be able to scan my VA papers, fill them out on computer then be able to print or email them, will this do it?",Y,"Yes, you can scan a Form and use the Typewriter function fo fill your information in. You can adjust font typ and size."
2199,open-ended,B0018QV3OC,"I do not understand the notation [OLD VERSION] in the version 9 standard. It must be pretty important , because it is in every document and description. I have Acrobat 8 pro.",,"Amazon routinely puts [OLD VERSION] if a product is not the latest version. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the product, just that it's not the latest version. Someone would be pretty ticked off if, for example, they bought Acrobat 9 for around $250 and then found out the current version is Acrobat XI and they could get that for around the same price."
2200,yes/no,B0018QV3OC,Is it compatible with Windows Vista,Y,Yes I do believe that it is
2201,yes/no,B0018QV3OC,does this version have a printer setup to print documents as PDF files. In other words when I print a document can this version convert it to a .PDF,Y,"Yes, when I go to ""print"" I get the option - Adobe PDF (Type: Adobe PDF converter)"
2202,yes/no,B0018QV3OC,"If I have saved an online form as a PDF, can I edit it with this?",Y,"You should be able to do that. Actually, that is why I bought this program because I had a blank govt. PDF job application that I wanted to fill in the requested personal information with my computer rather than write it in. It worked well for me and the price was right rather than buying a current version of the program./"
2203,open-ended,B0018QV3OC,How many licenses come with it?,,Only 1 license. Software can be loaded on two computers used by license holder.
2204,yes/no,B0018QV3OC,Is this compatible with Office 2007?,Y,"Yes, I'm running MS Office 2007 and Windows 7."

2225,open-ended,B001AEU0IW,Does trhis run on Widows 7 ???? Does anyone know if this program will run on windows 7?,,i checked on the site and it says it works with vista so it should work with windows 7 not sure if its compatible with windows 7 64bit though. if you do upgrade to windows 7 and get win7 pro it comes with a xp virtual machine so you could run anything that works with xp on it.
2226,yes/no,B001AEU0IW,Does it work with the Kindle Fire?,?,I do n ot know I don't have a Kindle of any version.
2227,open-ended,B001AFDZZ6,Is this better than PhotoImpact X3? Does it come with Real Draw Pro?,,"As far as I know PhotoImpact does not come packaged with Real Draw Pro. But, since Corel abandoned the product I am not sure how it is being marketed. I own both. Real Draw Pro is made by MediaChance and is a good product. However, these programs have very different functions. PhotoImpact X3 is a raster graphics program and Real Draw Pro is a vector graphics program. Raster files will suffer a decrement in resolution as they you zoom in on them and vector graphics don't. Even though that makes vector sound better, you will be better off if you use PhotoImpact for most routine graphics work such as photo editing. I use Real Draw Pro more often for very specialized graphics like logos. I still use PhotoImpact a lot but am slowly weaning away because I do not think it is being upgraded anymore. It will likely face compatibility issues as more operating systems are released (beyond Windows 8) or as programs expand to 64 bit environments. Paint Shop Pro is a nice program. But if you don't mind a little steaper investment you might want to consider either Photo & Graphic Designer or Designer Pro X (http://www.xara.com) . They are hybrid programs that support both raster and vector graphics but they really shine by the way their interactive controls allow you to see changes dynamically as you make them. You can download a trial version and try it out. I hope this helps. Also, I am running PhotoImpact X3 on Win 7 without a problem."
2228,open-ended,B001AFDZZ6,"Is this Photo Impact Pro 13 AKA ULead Photo Impact AKA Corel Photo Impact? If so, any improvements?",,"Yes, it is Corel Photo Impact. However, I know there were improvements, but didn't work with it to know what they are. I discovered that Corel was no longer going to develop it, and don't offer help. So I switched to using Paint Shop Pro X5 which Corel is maintaining and upgrading."
2229,yes/no,B001AFDZZ6,Will this work with Windows 8?,Y,"Since I live in Peru, I haven't received the software yet. My son will be bringing it with him in mid December when he visits me for the holidays. What I can say is that I am presently using PhotoImpact 12 with Windows 8 with no problems. My presumption is that PotoImpact Pro 13 should work as well."
2230,open-ended,B001AFDZZ6,Compatible with Windows 8? I downloaded it to XP and ran Windows 8 Upgrade Asst. It does not show up as incompatible nor compatible. Good sign?,,"Yes, this software is compatible with Windows 8."
2231,yes/no,B001AFDZZ6,Does this wok with Windows 8.1?,Y,I am sorry but I have windows 7 and my old xp version is not compatible. If this program states that it is compatible with windows 8 then by all means purchase it. It is an awesome program but will take time to use as it is more on the advanced level.
2232,yes/no,B001AFFYSW,Does the RS Japanese program teach you to read Kanji?,Y,"Yes, it displays phrases in romaji, hirigana/katakana, and kanji. The is also an option that has kanji with furigana, which is what I use mostly."
2233,yes/no,B001AFFYSW,Is there ANYBODY who has actually completed this?,?,"I just completed Level 1, and I've been taking a Level 1 8-week university continuing education class as well. I'd say we covered a bit more during the 8-week class than Rosetta Stone Level 1. The RS software is excellent for helping to memorize words and phrases, but you really need a class to fill in the gaps and practice in a real world environment."

If so, you will see that the family pack costs $49, whereas two copies of the single install will cost $58 (29 + 29). It's up to you. Do you want to pay less and get more? Or do you want to pay more, and get less?"

I ordered this under $30 update disc to upgrade to snow leopard after being told at the local Apple store that it positively would not work and I needed the expensive box set instead. Well, so much for their geniuses-it worked just fine. 45 minutes to go to 10.6.3 then another 30 to download all of the newest updates and it's running perfectly. I did order a 2 gig memory module to take me to 3 gig total, the most my machine can recognize. This is definitely worth a try if you are thinking of upgrading. I also did a complete backup of my hard drive first. It would also be handy to have an empty external drive on hand (320-500 gigs are available cheap) to set up for time machine backups. Good luck-go for it!"
2239,open-ended,B001AMHWP8,At these prices ??? Why would anyone consider buying the Snow Leopard upgrade from Amazon or any of these vendors when Apple is selling it for $29?,,Hey - I was going to tell everyone - DO NOT BUY LEOPARD FOR MORE THAN 29.00. Apple if you call them will sell you a copy of the Snow Leopard for 29.00. I just bought mine today due to some bought software that wouldn't work with 10.5.8
2240,yes/no,B001AMHWP8,I have Mac 10.4.11. Will this upgrade work for my computer?,?,"It did upgrade some of my functions but it also has caused a bunch of problems. I would suggest that you take your MAC to an expert instead of doing it yourself, unless you are very good at computers."
2241,open-ended,B001AMHWP8,"Use to start over? Is this disc strictly an ""upgrade"" or can I use it to install the OS on an empty drive?",,"You can install it without need for Tiger, Leopard, etc. I think that legally, you should have Tiger or Leopard to install Snow Leopard, but I wouldn't recommend upgrading over an existing system. It's OK if you don't have iLife or iWork, as when I bought my Mac over three years ago (had Tiger) that didn't have serial number for iWork, and so I'd assume that any 'bonus' software like that you'd have to pay for anyway. Hope this helps. Don't use Time Machine--just copy all your important documents and whatever else to the other drive manually. That's what I do. I don't trust backup programs (many people don't--I've read some horror stories in the past on data loss)."
2242,open-ended,B001AMHWP8,single user versus family pack: My main question is--how many computers can I load the basic Snow Leopard program onto?,,Great question - I have the same one about upgrading an older Mac running 10.5.8 with the 10.6.4 disc that came with my newer mac.... Can I use the discs that came with the hardware?
2243,open-ended,B001AMHWP8,Full Version of Snow Leopard?,,"All Mac OS DVDs shipped by Apple to date have been full versions. Technically, Apple's license specifies that one must buy the box set, (Mac OS, iLife and iWork), if one wishes to upgrade from Tiger rather than Leopard. Nevertheless, the Snow Leopard only DVD installs just the same for those with Tiger, and Apple does not police or punish those who choose this route. The installed OS is still eligible for all 10.6.X updates. Apple does not play the same games Microsoft plays with its OS upgrades. If you are attempting to install the Mac OS on a netbook PC to create a HacIntosh, though, I recall reading of Apple's move to prevent this. The installation program reportedly checks the processor type. If it's an Intel Atom, (i.e. a netbook), it halts all further installation. However, Apple cannot distinguish between Intel processors common to both Macs and PCs. Consequently, one can create a HacIntosh from a standard PC, (i.e. those without an Intel Atom processor), of recent vintage. You might wish to research this point further if this is your intent."
2244,open-ended,B001AMHWP8,10.6.3 version: Can someone verify if this version being sold on Amazon is the 10.6.3 version?,,"I just got mine...and it is the 10.6.3 version. Only complaint...took Amazon 7 days to process the order before it actually shipped...normally takes only 24-48 hours..., even though it stated they had it in stock, and the vendor was only one stateline away. So, if you need it right away...use another seller."
2245,open-ended,B001AMLPYM,does this require an upgrade from 1GB? i presently have tiger and have 1 GB ram...will the installation of this slow my mac down??,,"I can't actually answer your question (yet, going to install soon) however since the upgrade to 2gb (via two 1gb chips) is only around $30 here on amazon it seems silly not to upgrade.. also waiting on my memory so I'll post back with my experiences :)"

It's been a while since I've dealt with a new OS or office software-can anyone tell me if the single license Mac Box Set allows for installation of all its software to both a laptop and a...,,"There's nothing to prevent you from installing it on multiple computers, but technically you would need the Family Pack which is good for up to five computers."
2247,open-ended,B001AMLPYM,"Are these disks single or double layer DVD's my g5 will not read double layer dvd's. thanks,",,"As far as I know my Mac (which is down in CA currently) can read any disk I put in , I doubt it is double layer. Frankly I do not think I have ever run into double layer DVDs. Check the Apple help line, they may advise you. Sorry I am not more help."
2248,open-ended,B001AMPP0W,Can I use it (Snow Leopard family) on my mac and my sisters' across the street? Is it possible to use the Family pack on her Mac as well?,,"We asked Apple if we could install our family pack on my parent's computer (in Los Angeles), on my brother's (in downtown L.A.), and on my wife's, family's, and my computer: a total of six computers. It doesn't hurt to ask: the Apple representative said, ""No problem. We're just glad you enjoy our product. We really aren't concerned with that."""
2249,open-ended,B001AMPP0W,"Why does it say 10.5? Snow Leopard is 10.6, how do I know I'm ordering the right product?",,"It says 10.5 (Leopard) because that is the installation requirement for 10.6 (Snow Leopard). As is stated, you cannot upgrade to Snow Leopard from an OS X version prior to 10.5 (Leopard)."
2250,open-ended,B001AMPP0W,It is 10.6 o 10.6.3 version?,,"they'll probably send you 10.6, but then you can update it through the software update menu. you'll need an internet connection."

It's very cheap, even from Apple (only $20): http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard.

I have to buy the 10.6,,"If you currently have Leopard (10.5) and want to upgrade to Snow Leopard (10.6) then you will need to have a Mac with an Intel processor, 1GB of Ram and 5GB of free space on your hard drive."
2255,open-ended,B001AMPP0W,iWork &amp; iLife from Snow Leopard Family Pack OK on PPC iMac G5? Anyone know of any reason why this would not work?,,"Well... man... that's a good question. The box set includes a Snow Leopard DVD, an iWork DVD, and an iLife DVD (keep in mind that the regular Snow Leopard family pack, that's not a box set, does not include iLife or iWork). The Snow Leopard one is only for Intel Macs. I know the retail iWork and iLife versions work on PowerPC, and I would assume that they are *probably* using the same ones, since the installer packages that you could download (such as for the iWork trial) are for both Intel and PowerPC, and since they wouldn't have to put separate files on there it would probably be easiest for them to include disks that supported PowerPC. Then again, I can't confirm this and it is a possibility that they assumed they only needed to include Intel support. One possible option you have is to buy iWork/iLife/Snow Leopard separately. The actual disks that are included in single-license copies are the same as in the family-pack ones, meaning it will install on all your computers. So what you could do is purchase those disks separately (either with family packs or not) to approximate the price of the Mac Box Set Family Pack. Of course, the best option would be to actually call 1-800-MY-APPLE and ask them if the iWork and iLife work on PPC. If not, you could ask them about buying the non-family pack versions separately to see if it's ok. I'm sure they'll be fine with it."
2256,open-ended,B001AMPP0W,What? No release date delivery?,,"Yeah, but they just lowered the price $5 here on Amazon for the Family Pack. I ordered mine from Apple and although it will be nice to get it on Friday so I can do a clean install on my main computer over the weekend, I might have been willing to wait a few days to get it and save almost $10 (since Apple pops you for sales tax as well). Sounds like the classic ""trade-off""."
2257,open-ended,B001AMPP0W,No support G4: Apple is now becoming like Microsoft that we need to start upgrading our gear so that latest OS will run?,,"I, too, agree with dosers and Mark B. Plus, I'd add that you're somewhat looking at the glass as half empty. You've got a Mac G4...that's still working...on Leopard, perhaps. That's got to be at least a 5 year old computer, if not older, that is still working to your satisfaction. There's something to be said for that! If and when you're ready to get a new Mac w/ Intel processors, it will be worth it. But rest assured that your current Mac has exceeded the average expectancy and expectations of personal computers."

2260,yes/no,B001B010PC,Can the Nikon Capture NX2 Upgrade be used to upgrade from Nikon NX2?,?,"I would assume that NX2 is Capture NX2. In which case, you would be upgrading from Capture NX2 to Capture NX2. Sounds like someone has you running in a circle, unless course I am sadly mistaken, and they actually are 2 different versions."
2261,yes/no,B001B010PC,Is it compatable with windows 8,?,"According to the specifications, Nikon Capture NX 2 is compatible with pre-installed Windows 8.1. With that statement, it may not be compatible with an upgrade from a previous version of Windows. Hope that answers your question."

The moment you install it you will be prompted to check for updates. Then you can update to the latest version. Yes, it runs on the latest OS X I have a new macbook pro running the latest OS X and have no issues. About versions. Typically the only version updates that take place are to add support for new models of cameras. The features in NX are rock solid."

Will this software allow me to create photo and video albums?,?,"Capture nx2 isn't designed for making albums, specifically it is designed for editing photos, color correction, enhancement etc. To create albums use the viewnx program that came with your camera software. Congratulations you have one of the best dslr's on the market today."
2273,yes/no,B001B057U6,Does it work with D4S,Y,Yes! This software works with the new d4s because it operates on the file format .nef which is Nikon's raw file format. This software is very easy to use and understand.

Anyone have observations about this?,,"I use to use Dragon 8 Medical, then upgraded to Dragon 9 preferred, and with a little training, then upgrade to Dragon 9.5, it handles my medical terminology well. Not worth the additional $1000 to get the Dragon 9.5 Medical."
2277,open-ended,B001B5J7LQ,What's the best microphone for Dragon 10? Any suggestions?,,"The best microphone I've used with Dragon is the Sennheiser ME3 (or ME-3). This headset has amazing noise cancellation capabilities, and is fairly comfortable when worn for a long time (you really need good noise cancellation to avoid confusing Dragon). The only issue is that the ME-3 is rather pricey -- about $135 on Amazon. A good alternative to the ME-3 is the Radio Shack 33-3012 ""Headset Microphone with Gooseneck Boom"", which is less than $25 but performs nearly as well as the Sennheiser (this microphone is a virtual clone of the Sennheiser). In fact, I routinely use my Radio Shack and leave my expensive Sennheiser in the box the 33-3012 came in! The Radio Shack microphone includes a long cord extension with an on/off switch, something that is missing from the Sennheiser. Any microphone is going to work best with a ""USB sound pod"" device. A sound pod is an ""active"" device that accepts the 1/8"" male plug on most headset style microphones and plugs into any USB port on your computer. It works as an amplifier (I guess) and provides a much, much better signal than any consumer-quality microphone. I use a VXI ""Translator"" pod I got from emicrophones.com, but the Andrea units are also reputed to be good. Plan to spend about $40 to $60 for a pod, but it makes a world of difference in the quality of Dragon Naturally Speaking dictation. (Without a pod, you're relying on your computer's sound card to provide amplification. Generally speaking, sound cards in most desktops and laptops are very poor at handling microphone input, and are much better at playing music and game sounds.) BTW: Microphone positioning is everything when it comes to speech recognition. The mouthpiece must be moved away from your mouth -- I position it about 2 to 3 inches to the right of my mouth to avoid breath sounds and noises that confuse Dragon."
2278,open-ended,B001B5J7LQ,Dragon Fails with Vista 64 bit: Is there a workaround for this bug?,,"DNS 10 will not run on Vista 64-bit. Vista 64-bit uses a different Speech Application Programming Interface (SAPI) and Nuance has not yet made it a priority to code for the 64-bit version. On the bright side, Windows Vista's built-in speech recognition engine has vastly improved and is free (and works under the 64-bit environment)."
2279,open-ended,B001B5J7LQ,"I'm a college student, and I wanted to use Dragon during my professors lectures. Can Dragon do that or will it only recognize my voice?",,Simple answer is : no. Dragon has to be trained to recognize each voice.
2280,open-ended,B001B5J7LQ,Transcribing teleconference recordings: Does anyone use Dragon for transcribing MP3 recordings of phone calls?,,I would also like to know whether anyone is using Dragon for the same purpose.

2282,open-ended,B001B5J7LQ,"I am wanting to use this for transcibing medical records from recordings from home, will this work well for this or am I better off with Dragon 11?",,You can use both to transcribe. You just need to know how to use it properly and it works wanders.

2289,yes/no,B001B5J7T8,does it work,?,"Yes it works and remarkably well I might say. However it still has some quirks which are dealt with more and more. The one thing you have to do is ""learn"" how to use it. To be motivated to do that you ""must"" have a compelling reason to want to use it. Prove it to yourself by telling it your ""family History"" and it will digitize it for you. You will have to then edit the text to correct quite a bit, but it gets better the more you use it and it becomes familiar with you. Morgan"

I have found that all the version are the same and the price difference is only the length of the subscription to the ancestry.com web site and you get discounts on some other things such as DNA testing. The platinum version gives you 6 months of online access while the essentials version gives you 1 month. I already have an annual subscription with ancestry.com so the more expensive versions are not necessary.
2297,open-ended,B001B5L5RA,FTM 2009: Can anyone tell me if there is a benefit to having FTM versus just creating your family tree on Ancestory.com?,,"Hi Sam, I'm Michelle Pfister, a Senior Product Manager for FTM. To answer your question, putting your family tree on Ancestry.com will work fine for you if you want the basic functionality of having historical records located automatically, and recording stories and photos for people in your tree. When you want more functionality, such as printing several types of reports, doing tree-wide searches for specific information, or keeping more detailed source information, then FTM is a better choice. Both Ancestry and FTM work together, so the record hints from Ancestry also display in FTM.

Family Tree Maker 2009 is not listed, probably because it is so new, but if 2008 is compatible I'd have to think 2009 is also.

Will this version allow me to still access the older projects?,?,"I have continually upgraded my print shop and have not lost any of my saved projects. I don't know if you'll have any problems if you go from PS10 right to PSD23. The only problem that I had was when one of my upgrades did not offer a border graphic that I was using in my business. However, since I had it saved, I could copy and paste it and could continue to use it. (Also recently, I went from WindowsXP to Windows7 and installed a upgraded PS and I didn't have any problems accessing my projects.)"

2310,open-ended,B001BY45QO,Does MobileMe push Outlook mail from an individual PC or from the Server? Would MobileMe push Outlook 2000 mail from my company issued Windows 2000 laptop to an iPhone?,,"Hi CuriousB! Here is how it works: 1. MobileMe does *not* push e-mails from Outlook on the Windows laptop (irrespective of which Windows OS you use) 2. It does *not* need IMAP or POP access to be enabled on your company's exchange server. 3. You do *not* need to buy MobileMe subscription to get Exchange e-mails on your iPhone. 4. iPhone uses what is called 'ActiveSync' technology licensed from Microsoft. 5. Messages are pushed directly from Microsoft Exchange server through the internet to your iPhone. 6. Microsoft Exchange 2003 Service Pack 2 and later support 'ActiveSync'. If your company uses an older version of Exchange, this will not work. 7. There is no additional configuration to be done by your company, since 'ActiveSync' is enabled by default when Exchange server is installed. 8. However, your company *can* disable 'ActiveSync' if it wants to on the Exchange Server. Most companies I know don't. However, your mileage may vary. You might want to check once with your network admins. 9. Another way to confirm is - if any of your co-workers are able to get work e-mails on their Windows Mobile phones, then you can get e-mails on iPhone too. (Windows Mobile phones also use 'ActiveSync') If you want, you can read additional information from Apple here: http://www.apple.com/iphone/enterprise/ Once again, if all you need are work e-mails on exchange server, you do *not* need to buy MobileMe subscription. Let me know if this helps! :)"

I've done it for the last 2 years. If you are on Apple's automatic renewal plan now, you might want to activate it a couple of weeks ahead of their billing date to avoid billing confusion. Yes, you keep your same e-mail, etc."

Don't even bother trying anything else. For converting the VHS to digital video, just use your old VHS and a Pinnacle 82410110301 Video Transfer USB Capture Device or similar. You could also use any miniDV camcorder that supports composite video input as a converter (feed the VHS signal into the camcorder and out as Firewire to the computer). The nice thing with the separate video capture device is that you can do the video grabbing to memory card while you're editing other videos on your Mac."

Just so you know the latest edition of CorelDraw is X5, however if you're just getting into this kind of stuff X4 should be fine."

Another Amazon vendor is offering the X6 version for just a dollar or two more, which is the product I purchased just last week. You used the term ""upgrade."" However, nothing I noticed in the product I recently purchased identified it as an upgrade. On the ""honor system,"" you're expected to be a home or student user, thus entitling you to purchase this full X6 version I purchased at a deeply discounted price. You'd also be entitled to making three installations and a license number was provided with the product, too. In other words, it's a full version, not an upgrade version. I installed it without a hitch. By the way, I'm also running Windows 7 Home Premium on an I5-3450 processor. So, as far as I can tell, you'd be perfectly ""good to go"" buying the X6 version I purchased for about the same price. Good luck with it."

I found the solution here: http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/forums/ShowMessage.asp?ForumID=4&MessageID=671897 Read the first post from ""blink3times"" and then a few posts later he explains exactly how to do it. That discussion was in April 2009. Scroll on down to January 24, 2010 to the ""jasonvideodad"" post where the discussion got going again and he added to the original post. By the way, I did not have all the files that were mentioned, but I made the change on the files I did have, and it has been working perfectly. Remember to backup up every one of these files before you make the changes. Please note that this is the user forum and this fix is not a recommendation by Sony. But I followed the instructions about ""resetting the memory flags"" and am able to render with no problems. The largest video I have rendered so far is a 6-1/2 minute video of AVCHD files with no problems. I am using Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. The video rendered in 3-1/2 minutes. I would suggest that you read (or at least scan) through all of the posts in case there is something else that might refer to your particular situation or computer.

Since Vegas Pro is the far more expensive professional version of Vegas Movie Studio Platinum, it's hard to imagine that it can't also do this. You zoom in on video clips in exactly the same way as you do with still photos. Keep in mind that if you do this, you almost certainly want to deinterlace your video if it wasn't filmed in progressive mode. It's not a big deal, just something you need to keep in mind.

Now some years back just to 'experiment' I've tried different applications on thumb drives plus i also used 'cheap dc disks' and ran many applications from the disk just like many run sega and nintendo games with great success tho the truth of the matter is some apps run fine and some flop totally tho Quicken tends to run very well for me, But please understand thats for me as I have ""no way' of understanding what computer system your using plus its ram hard drive etc,etc, And these capability's vary vastly from machine to machine etc,. My overall experience with running programs from USB drives is 'Not Good' but i have been quite successful by burning programs to cd blank disc's and running from the disk which is a good thing to keep in mind as disks are: 1. Cheap and pretty reliable. 2. Easily availible and you can buy them without attracting attention. 3. If your uses are both 'Private and Super Sentitive the disk can easily hidden or destroyed after use. 4. Some programs that just WONT run on USB will run like a scalded dog from a cd or dvd blank etc,... To Close I' have the greatest of respect for Quicken as its a great program but I cant really quote on Quick Books as I've never used it. But since I've switched to LINUX ive found that if you run WINE program then Quicken and many other Windows programs will run very well and the Hackers along with most surveillance programs cant even touch you, Not that i am a crook but my 'customers and clients' belong to me and to me alone period,. But having had accounting and bookkeeping in school myself let me remind one and all that the best bookeeping system is 1. The one that is simple and: 2. The one that works best for you etc,.

If your daughter is serious about photography and is willing to put time into learning and experimenting this will do the job.

I have purchased every version of elements and have noted that Adobe never patches their software.. they fix all the problems they find in the next version... Premiere 4 is buggy as all hell... read the comments it constantly crashes.. I suspect Premiere 7 will be far more stable otherwise why would they skip version 5 and 6 LOL. Photoshop elements 6 is far better than 5 but elements 4 was only slightly better than 3 (they added a poor quality UTUBE uploader that every one complained about and they never fixed). So you never know with Adobe the one thing for sure... if you want a more stable version of their software don't expect them to fix it for free... expect it in the next paid upgrade. The only thing you get when you click update is some new version of Adobe Acrobat reader... ??? Having said all that... these products are the best for their money in Windows environment.. hence the reason I keep upgrading with each version. Wish Final Cut would make it to the windows environment and give Adobe some real competition... by the way the new version of Adobe comes with the option of online back up of 20Gigs... come on Adobe.. with 10 meg cheap cameras that is no where near sufficient storage I have 50 gigs of photos alone not to mention my video files.
2366,yes/no,B001DMBWXS,Would this software be good for digital art?,?,I have to admit it's a cheap photo fix that I use for small projects. Anything big would depend on the detail of fixing needed. Hope that helps
2367,open-ended,B001DMBWXS,Is Photoshop Elements 7 compatible with Windows 7? Is Photoshop Elements 7 compatible with Windows 7?,,"It isn't. Dell sent me a DVD to find programs that aren't compatible with windows 7. photoshop elements 7 and premiere elements 7 are not. you have to get 8. and there is no cheap upgrade, you have to buy the whole product. it's a ripoff"
2368,open-ended,B001DMBWXS,Processing RAW files from Nikon D90 in Photoshop Elements 6: Is there a plug-in for Photoshop Elements 6.0 to be able to process RAW files from Nikon D90 cameras?,,"Save your money! I bought PE7 and haven't had any luck uploading RAW images from my Canon 50D. I am livid right now because of Amazon's misleading $20 rebate offer, Adobe's inconsistant customer service and Popular Photography magazine editor Debbie Grossman that wrote ""A step-by-step guide to editing RAW in Elements"" in the recent April 2009 issue. I downloaded ACR 5.3 from Adobe's website but still can't get my RAW uploaded in PE7. Adobe's customer service rep said Elements doesn't upload RAW images, you must 1st convert them to a JPEG or TIFF. If you want to work with RAW you purchase Lightroom 2 or CS4. What a bozo."
2369,open-ended,B001DMBWXS,"Elements 5, 6, or 7: Which version should I get and what are the pros and cons for getting a 5 vs a 6 or a 5 vs a 7?",,"Avoid Elements 5 if you have Vista. It claims to be compatible, but after a few months on my new Vista-loaded PC, Elements 5 decided it didn't care for it and stopped opening Editor. I called Photopshop support, where a representative told me they no longer support Elements 5, but there was a patch available to make it more agreeable to Vista. So I patched, rebooted and there it was in all its former glory. Until the next time. Again, that nasty little window popped up telling me essentially that my PC had no idea what I was asking it to do. Oh, and by the way, it now no longer knew what the Organizer was. I wound up downloading a free trial of Elements 7, which seems to work OK, but I'm still ticked off equally at Photoshop and Windows Vista. Cottage cheese seems to have a longer shelf life that most software packages these days. Excuse me while I go kick the dog."
2370,open-ended,B001DMBWXS,"Cannot Load Elements 7: How do I do that, and are there any other functions that I need to uninstall to load this software?",,"John, safe mode is a special mode of Windows mainly used to repair the operating system. You need to attempt to get the computer out of safe mode. One way to do this is to turn off the computer, then turn it back on, and before Windows starts to load repeatedly press the F8 key until you see the Windows Advanced Options menu. You can select ""Start Windows Normally"" from here. If it won't start ""normally"" you should take it in to get the operating system fixed. Windows might need to be reinstalled, so backup your data first. Good luck!"
2371,yes/no,B001DMBWXS,Is there a way to print my TurboTax return using Elements 7.0? It seems it only can print 1 page at a time vs. entire return at once.,?,I doubt it but I printed my entire return on TurboTax itself but I've never tried to use elements to print a turbo tax document good luck
2372,yes/no,B001DWKH66,Will this work on windows 7.,Y,"Yes, it will work on Win7. Used it for about 3 years on Win7."
2373,yes/no,B001DWKH66,will this work on Windows 8?,Y,"Yes... But if you try to send it on the net, better use drop box."
2374,yes/no,B001DWKH66,will it install and run on windows 7,?,"I have windows 7 and had to set up a virtual machine (which is like a separate operating system inside of the windows 7 operating system)to be able to use it. Windows 7 claims it's not a problem, but I had to hire a computer professional to set it up because there are issues with having your printer and other peripherals recognized and available to both the wiindows 7 programs and ones on the ""virtual machine"" ."
2375,yes/no,B001DWKH66,"Will this work on Windows 8.1, most importantly, Paradox?",Y,Word Perfect 8 is VERY OLD and was designed to work with Windows 95 - I doubt it will work with any of the newer Windows operating systems.
2376,yes/no,B001DWKH66,Does it work with Windows 7,Y,"Yes it does. While this was made before windows 7 existed, it works right out of the box in windows 7."
2377,yes/no,B001DWKH66,"have documents from Word Perfect 2003, can I use those documents with WP 8 Professional and can I have the same features that I have now?",?,"With your word 2003 documents..when you do save as...go to the ""save as type""..the drop down menu will give you options on saving your docs.. not sure which ones are on 2003 version but try them all. Then when you get your new version you should be able to open them. Not sure about the other question and the features."
2378,yes/no,B001DWKH66,"does this contain the word perfect ""word"" program?",?,"Word is the Microsoft Office word processing program. WordPerfect is the Corel word processing program. In order to get Word, you will need to purchase Microsoft Office."
2379,yes/no,B001DWKH66,Are the Corel Word Perfect programs able to open Open Office docs?,Y,Yes.
2380,open-ended,B001DWKH66,"I recently saw on Amazon a Word Perfect Student and Home for 34.00+. I am looking to buy Word Perfect for my Windows 8 OS, 64bit",,yes. it should cooperate.
2381,open-ended,B001E0RZ3U,1 user 3 pc license: What do they mean by 1 user but 3 pc license?,,They mean you can put the software on up to 3 pc's belonging to the same person at any given time.
2382,open-ended,B001E0RZ3U,"When they title this product [OLD VERSION] are they calling it old in comparison to 2010, or is there a new and old version of 2009? I just wanted to know why it says OLD VERSION in the title of this product, is that due to the fact that its older than...",,"You probably have an answer to this already, but: When a new version of a product is released (in this case NIS 2010), Amazon labels the old version [OLD VERSION]. So, there is only one NIS 2009, but there is a new version of NIS, namely NIS 2010."
2383,yes/no,B001E0RZ3U,"If you want to upgrade to beyound 2009, do you have to buy new licenses?",Y,"Yes, you can also upgrade for free to newer Norton versions of same product and you will get the remaining subscription days you were left in older version in the new one as well. But keep in mind it only works for same product only.. NIS to NIS, NAv to NAV & N360 to N360. If you have Norton AntiVirus you cannot upgrade to Norton Internet Security or Norton 360"
2384,open-ended,B001ECGT8A,Should I purchase QB for my home computer just to learn the program? Any thoughts?,,"Hi David, I was laid-off a few years ago, and while I was between jobs, I took classes at a Jr. College. My goal was to open my own business as a freelance bookkeeper, thereby becoming layoff proof! I actually attended two colleges as one was online. I took classes in QuickBooks and Peachtree. One of my textbooks was from The Sleeter group. You can buy their books online. These books come with practice files and the college has free or low cost versions of the software for you to learn with. Starting my own business was an excellent move."
2385,open-ended,B001ECGT8A,'09 QB Problems solved? Can anyone tell me if QB has solved their '09 Pro problems?,,"Good cent, Did you took the name of the tech. /sales support. If so next time you can track it. I am also waiting for the fix in QB pro-2009."
2386,open-ended,B001ECGT8A,hye i bought quick book used version 2009 but i have to register within 10 days but amazon did not provide me registration business number and business postal number so where i can get this number,,I bought a new version 209 quick book. amazon should have gave you the numbers for registration. You could call intuit and maybe they can help .I don't think they support 209 anymore.
2387,yes/no,B001ECGT8A,does this product run on windows 7?,?,"It should, I am running it on Windows XP Professional an older version without issue."
2388,open-ended,B001ECGT8A,How is QB handling credit memos in accounts payable now? Has anyone noticed whether this is still happening in QBPro 09?,,"I have had QB for 10 yr. and now I'm using Premier 2008. I too have the same complaint with the credit memo issue, and would like to add to your comments: When I pay multiple invoices, the credit memo alert needs to be much bigger or a different color (put it in red) so it is more noticeable and I will remember to use the credit. Also, you have to check the applicable invoice and go through the process of using the credit, then go back and pay the other invoices. If you do not do it this way, the credit will not even show up, if you just go and check all the invoices that you want to pay."
2389,yes/no,B001ECGT8A,Can a single user version be used on more than one computer: If I download it to my home desktop will I be able to use it at the office if I buy the single user version?,?,Thanks for the helpful response. I intend to back it up on a thumb drive.
2390,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,I need a Video Editting Software Recommendation for Vista 64 bit?,,"Hello Burak, I recommend a 2.4GHz Dual or Quad-core processor or higher in order to improve your issue(if you are doing high-definition editing ie. 1920x1080 editing--if you are doing standard video editing then you processor should suffice). 4GB of RAM should suffice but it is recommended that you have a higher GHz processor. This should improve lock-ups/freezes. Vista is not the greatest operating system but there are ways around it to make it work better. Also, I recommend Corel Videostudio Pro X2 over Pinnacle anyday...I have Pinnacle Studio 12 and it definetly has more software issues then Coral has. I hope I was of some help. George"
2391,yes/no,B001EJTO8A,Can I convert VHS tapes to DVD using this software?,N,"No, I've found the best way to do that is to buy a VHS to DVD recorder. Once you transfer the VHS to DVD, you can rip it to your computer then edit it in this program."
2392,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,Corel VideoStudio pro X2 stop working error message: Any one can help?,,"Raymond, it is probably conflicting with a newer version of Quicktime. I had the same problem until I uninstalled the current version of Quicktime and then installed Quicktime Alternative 311. It stops it from freezing up. The problem is then that iTunes won't work if you have a recent version because it needs the newer QT. I've tried installing the patches for Video Studio Pro X2, but that doesn't help. Anyone found a better solution?"
2393,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,capture and edit from non-copyrighted (homemovie) dvd? With this software can you capture video from an existing non-copyrighted (home movie) dvd and then edit the video and re-burn to dvd or save on your computer?,,"Absolutely! Not that I'm encouraging illegal activity, but, if you have a DVD decrypter, you can save a copyrighted DVD to disc (via the decrypter) and import it into VS using the import wizard (just remember to look for the saved/decrypted folder, not a disc in a drive)."
2394,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,Rotate video? Does anyone know if this software can rotate video?,,"Check out the review left on November 2, 2008 by Chawks. They list that as one of the things it can do. I was wondering the same thing. I did that with my daughters camera and how silly I felt to shoot it sideways trying to get it closer. I had been shooting stills with it all day and it all happened so fast I did not think before I shot it trying not to miss a kid on stilts. So, I am going to try this one and hope it does that."
2395,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,"File format mismatch: So how do I fix or alter that ""mismatch format"" problem?",,"The problem is that your video is MP4. So far as I can tell, Videostudio just doesn't support that. You can convert your footage pretty easily though. Try the Freemake video converter. It's freeware and it just works."
2396,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,will this work for Windows 7 platform? I know it says it works for Windows XP and Vista but will it work with Windows 7?,,according to their website it will.
2397,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,Manual: Is there an independently-published manual out there?,,I've not found one I've looked for one too-- there isn't one.
2398,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,Corel VideoSudio Pro X2: Will this software allow me to capture the video from these DVDs?,,"Yes! Importing of DVD clips is included, if not primary, to this software."
2399,open-ended,B001EJTO8A,Fitting a video clip that is too long: How can I make it fit on one DVD?,,"Most software will automatically compress as needed. I use Sony Vegas Movie Studio and that's what it does, at least with avi files. When you are ready to burn, it will warn you that it needs to compress to fit on the target disk. As far as working with other formats, you would just have to find out what formats the software handles or convert it. Another option is DL (double-layer) disks."
2400,yes/no,B001EJVQDG,Will this run properly on Vista 64 bit operating systems? Whereas Microsoft says no to Photoshop Elements 7.,Y,Yes - I've been using PS Elements 7 and Corel PSP Photo X2 on a Vista Ultimate 64 machine for several months with no problems.
2401,open-ended,B001EJVQDG,extracting one object/person out of a picture: does corel ultimate x2 allow you to erase/extract object/person from a photo and place them on to a new background for a diff pic?,,"I am also interested in this question, since I am thinking of switching to PSP from Elements, which DOES allow this."
2402,yes/no,B001EJVQDG,Can this product combine two pictures (not HDR combine),Y,"Most definitely yes. I have been using this program for years, and I have even brought it to work and showed it to my boss... we now have 6 licensed copies at work for doing that very thing. I use this program mainly for taking parts of photos and combining them with other photos to create graphics to fill our customers' requests. Each element you use can be placed on a separate layer to be blended and edited independently from the other elements. It is very easy to do, and you can enhance your creations with plug in filters that are designed for Photo Shop. (Yes, PS filters work in PSP). Alien Skin has some excellent filters and you can download demos of them to try out."
2403,open-ended,B001EJVQDG,Windows 7: Can this run on Windows 7 64 bit operating system?,,"Like the person above asked..I have Corel Paint Shop X2 as well and now contemplating buying a Dell laptop. It has windows7 installed on it. So, there are now two people wanting to know if this X2 will run? I do lots of graphics, imposing on photos with other objets, etc....Could we pleeeeeease get an answer from someone that may be already running PSP X2 while using windows7? Thank you, Tiger"
2404,yes/no,B001EJVQDG,will this run with windows 7 64bit?,Y,I am running it on Windows 7 64 bit and works great.
2405,yes/no,B001EJVQDG,do you have the licence for it (product code)?,Y,Yes Why?
2406,yes/no,B001EJVQDG,can you use this version with windows 8?,N,"Good question. I have no idea!! An E-Mail to Corel should answer that. Sorry that I cannot be of more assistance but I use with Windows 7 John Springfield, OR."
2407,open-ended,B001EUBSL0,cs4 compatible with windows 7? Does anyone know if CS4 will work on Windows 7?,,"My experience is that it will not install on my computer after I upgraded to Windows 7 Professional 64 bit. My copy of Photoshop CS4 Extended had worked OK on both Windows XP and Vista64bit prior to my purchase of Win7. If interested, see my review posted under the full retail version of this product."
2408,open-ended,B001EUBSL0,photoshop cs4: Is this photoshop upgrade only for photoshop cs versions?.,,I would also like to know this.
2409,open-ended,B001EUBSL0,"CS4 + calibrated monitor + costco color profiles loaded: Anyone done this , I have an Imac 6 months old ?",,"Costco gives very good prints with ""auto correct on"" if you save your file with an embedded sRGB profile. Their printer drivers are tuned for sRGB (adobe RGB (aRGB) gives poor results as the default). You can get better results (marginally) if you download the ICC profiles from Dry Creek and turn off ""auto correct"". However this is much more complicated (instructions on how to do this are on the Costco website). You have to edit in one color space, then soft proof and convert the profile from the working color space to the Dry Creek profile. This is not worth the effort unless you are selling your prints, and even then ....... My advice, try sRGB with no auto correct."
2410,open-ended,B001EUBSL0,Photoshop CS4 Price: Why does the price fluxuate on this item so much?,,Your answer is the prima facie reason to not purchase this here. Pure obsfuscation. A product's price is a product's price. I was about to purchase but your snarky (and rude) answer to the legitimate question made me not do so. You are paternalistic. I can use another vendor and I will.
2411,open-ended,B001F5VBRU,Rebate? I don't see any mention of it here... does anyone know about this?,,I had to email them in regards to the rebate.. still awaiting a response.
2412,yes/no,B001F5VBRU,is this work for windows 7,Y,"It works for Windows 7 (at least 32 bit), but you need the updated version to work in current Apple OS's. Sometimes you can buy the old version cheap enough just to get the upgrade price on the new Fusion. Parallels is a comparable system and an older version does work on current Macs"
2413,open-ended,B001F5VBRU,Has anyone received their free upgrade to version 3 yet? Has anyone gotten their free upgrade yet?,,"I'm also looking for this upgrade but I have a feeling we've been given bad information. I don't see anywhere on the VMware website about a free upgrade for recently purchased product. Only a paid upgrade. Chris L, where is it that you are entering your serial number online?"
2414,open-ended,B001FSG0XC,how well does it do with content filtering?,,"After installing this version of KIS my system slowed to a crawl. It would take 10 minutes to boot. After I figured out it was Kaspersky, I removed it and haven't used their products since. At my work with 2000 computers, they use McAfee."
2415,open-ended,B001FSG0XC,"Best Anti-Virus: Many anti-virus has been used, but which one is the best?",,I use Kaspersky Internet Security on my Vista laptop. It works great but at one time for some reason Id get blue screens and Vista said Kaspersky was the cause. What I did was go to the repair-uninstall feature and did the repair and its worked fine since then. I also use nod32. Both Kaspersky and nod32 are very highly rated but I think nod32 is supposed to use less system resources and may be a better choice if you dont have a high performance computer. I found a good deal on nod32 but honestly if you wait and look around you should be able to find Kaspersky for a free after rebate price.
2416,open-ended,B001FSG0XC,does kis 2010 work with vista and ie8? does kis2010 work with vista and ie8?,,"Having had bad experience with Kaspersy before, I would not venture any further. Just getting out of Kaspersy mess takes a day."
2417,open-ended,B001GBZALQ,If I want to take a placement test for college Italian how far should I go in this program to test out of Italian 101 and 102?,,"Level 4, Fluenz"
2418,open-ended,B001GBZALQ,shills? is it just me or do all these reviews seem like shills?,,"Hi, I'm a part of the Fluenz team. Thanks for taking an interest in our software and for your concern over Amazon remaining a valuable place for people looking to get objective reviews. We've been selling at Amazon for about a year and a half now. Over the course of that time, Amazon has contacted thousands of our users directly, and hundreds of them have responded by posting Seller Reviews. I bring this up because the Seller Reviews--4.8 stars from nearly 300 people--mirror the general feelings of the product reviews. There are a few negative ones in there (one person hated that he had to use the DVD, another experienced a shipping mistake, others had some usability issues), but overall they're very positive. And the only way anyone can submit a Seller Review is if they actually buy a Fluenz program at Amazon, and Amazon contacts them directly asking for their comments. Of course all the reviews on our product pages are real, but I think pointing you to these Seller Reviews is the easiest way to show this. You can read these reviews here:"
2419,open-ended,B001GBZALQ,my need is to practice my italian I understand it very well since it was my first language so I need the advance version please advice,,"Hi Andres, We also have Levels 3+4+5 available here: http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Italian-Fluenz-Mac-iPhone/dp/B00A3MV5XQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1427807988&sr=8-2&keywords=fluenz+italian+3%2B4%2B5 Cheers,"
2420,open-ended,B001GBZALQ,"Hey Fluenz, what if I guy Italian 1+2 and then want 3,4,5? Can I buy just those as a set/addon, or to I have to buy 1-5 to complete it?",,"Hi Eric, After ordering Italian 1+2, you can purchase the user upgrade for levels 3+4+5 directly through us. When you're ready to move onto those levels, just let us know and we can provide further help. - Fluenz User Support"
2421,open-ended,B001GBZALQ,Florenz levels: Do I need both levels or just level 1?,,I think you wanna get them both - italian isn't an easy language to learn and after going through both of the levels you will have a very basic Italian knowledge. pretty much enough to get by while traveling.
2422,yes/no,B001GFU6MK,Are the lessons able to be put onto my mp3 player?,Y,Yes you can. It comes with an Audio Companion for MP3 players. I have mine on my iPod.
2423,open-ended,B001GFU6MK,what is the website's name?,,Its http://www.discoverspanish.com/
2424,open-ended,B001GFU6MK,Is this Latin American Spanish or Spanish from Spain? Thank you!,,Latin Spanish
2425,yes/no,B001GFU6MK,"Can multiple children use this, like the online version?",Y,"Yes several children as well as adults could use this program to learn the basics of spanish, it is most helpful in learning conversational spanish."
2426,yes/no,B001GFU6MK,Does this software work with Windows 8?,?,"It has a copywrite of 2012, so I would imagine it does. It does not say on their web site or in the packaging."
2427,open-ended,B001GFU6MK,What level of spanish will this go up to? I tried the free 6 first lesson podcasts and they were too basic.,,I don't know this CD wasn't up to my standards on Spanish because this was too basic for me to. I instead opted for a different program. In my opinion Fluenz Spanish is a good one. I'm sorry that this didn't officially answer your question. Best of Luck!
2428,yes/no,B001GL6QHS,Has anyone used www.taxact.com ????,Y,"Just used it because of a suggestion on one of the reviews on amazon. I was fully satisifed. Within 2 hours I had filed my federal and state forms electronically and paid much less than TurboTax or TaxCut. I itemize deductions but otherwise don't have an especially complicated tax form to file, so I'm not sure how it would work with a more complicated tax situation."
2429,yes/no,B001GL6QHS,"TurboTax 2008 vs Tax Cut: So, are Tax Cut users really satisfied?",?,"A couple years ago I tried TaxCut after the TurboTax fiasco regarding rebates. I cut off my nose to spite my face. TaxCut could not accurately record and report the Clergy Housing Allowance calculations. I had to ""lie"" to the program to get the results I knew to be true (been doing my own clergy tax for almost 30 years with no problems and no audits). I wrote TaxCut with a detailed description of the problem, but have never received a response. Also, I found TaxCut clumsy and harder to use compared to TurboTax. Although I am back to TT this year and last, it may be time to use downloaded forms from IRS along with a desktop calculator. Others may want to begin paying a tax preparer and avoid the hassle altogether."
2430,open-ended,B001GL6QHS,how to import my etrade stock trades? But how do I get this txf file?,,"You can use some online tools to convert your etrade data into txf format. Try this out: http://www.txf-express.com/ This site provides both online service and a downloadable software. I used their on-line service. A real time saver I must say. BTW, it costs me 3 bucks. A pretty good value."
2431,open-ended,B001GL6QHS,What happened to the 300+ reviews about TurboTax Deluxe? Did Amazon admin delete the others?,,"If you scroll down the main page (instead of clicking on the reviews) you'll find (highlighted in yellow): ""Looking for Customer Reviews for a previous version? Customer Reviews submitted on Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal State + eFile 2008 prior to December 13, 2008, have been moved to the previous version of the product because the product was updated at that time."" Don't know when exactly it was done, but those hundreds of bad reviews were moved to the link under 'previous version'. Kinda sneaky of Amazon."
2432,open-ended,B001GL6QHS,Transfer from TT to TaxCut? Can TaxCut import my date from my 2007 TT files?,,"Yes, TaxCut can import previous years' TurboTax data."
2433,open-ended,B001GL6QHS,The people giving 5 star ratings are most likely hired: Do you see a pattern here?,,"I'm not hired either and I gave it 5 stars. One issue I do have with the ratings is people who are using TT Basic, Business, etc are reviewing the ""Deluxe"" version. Every version has different features and although many concepts are the same I don't think a review on ""Turbo Tax Basic"" should be a spotlight review for Turbo Tax Deluxe as there are differences."
2434,open-ended,B001GL6QHS,"Oh what a surprise, Amazon raises the price yet again! Is this country going down the crapper or what?",,"I agree! It is absolutely crazy that on Saturday night when I placed it in my cart it had dropped to $41.99 (unable to finalize purchase because I was waiting for an email reply from TT support regarding the functions of Deluxe version). The next day it was at $49.99. Now it is listed at $53.99! For goodness sake, give me your best offer - then leave it alone while I resolve all of the other issues with TT and make a decision."
2435,open-ended,B001GL6QHS,When will Intuit Learn?,,"Right on the nose! I used Quickbooks for years and finally just gave up on this company. It sure seems that marketing is running this company, and trying to do so based on profits alone, totally ignoring the shoddy products they are putting out. Adding ""features"" that only provide more money for Intuit, are not improvements. It has always been nearly impossible to import data to Quickbooks, and a few simple wizards and a free UPS shipping interface would have gotten them a lock on the whole market if they had just included them FOR FREE and stopped trying to sell us other stuff we did not want. This latest deal is just a window into a company that just doesn't ""get it"". I have used TaxCut for years and its just super."
2436,open-ended,B001GL6QHS,What is going on with the price of TurboTax?,,"Folks, I've posted this before but I'll say it again. Do not just automatically purchase TurboTax (or anything else from Amazon, for that matter) from the first window that pops up on your screen. ALWAYS click on the ""New and Used"" button further down the page. The initial price you see is not necessarily the lowest price you can buy the item for. For example, right now the price of TurboTax Deluxe + State + eFile is $42.50 at the top of this page. If you click on the ""New and Used"" button you'll see a list of other merchants who are also selling TT through Amazon. One has it for $28.99. It's the same new-in-box product that the other vendor is selling for a lot more. I did this last week and with shipping my TT Deluxe was around $32. Exact same product that others here have paid $40, $50 and more for."
2437,open-ended,B001GL6QHS,Anyway to avoid additional state purchase? Anyway around this?,,TaxAct.com 13.95 to file BOTH Federal and State!
2438,open-ended,B001HOD50K,"5 free federal e-files: Does this mean I can do returns for 4 other people, regardless if they are related to me, or a dependant?",,"I have been using Tax Cut for 4 years now. How the states have worked in the past is you get one state if you buy a product that includes the state. You can do as many state returns as you want for that state. For example, I live in Virginia and I can do my return and as many friends returns as I want on the software as long as they are in Virginia. My family lives in Kentucky, so I have to buy an additional state for Kentucky, but I can do as many as I want with that state. The e-file fees are separate. You have to pay those fees for each state return e-filed. If you paper file, there are no additional fees for the states once you purchase that state. As far as the federal e-file is concerned, you can use the 5 free for any 5 federal returns that you e-file - doesn't matter who they are. Hope this helps in clearing some of the confusion! Overall, I have been very pleased with the software and will use it again this year."
2439,open-ended,B001HOD50K,Windows System Requirements for Tax Cut 2008: Does anybody happen to know if there is a requirements that SP2 is installed on a Windows XP system to install and run this software?,,"Linda, I run Windows XP SP2 and have the updates installed as an automatic routine. It's not a political issue with me, it's just a matter of keeping the OS updates properly installed. They actually do improve the performance of a system. As far as browsers go, I'm currently running (in order of priority) Google Chrome, MSIE 8 (beta), and Firefox. These are all on a single computer as I write this to you, an aging HP with an Intel Celeron processor, as can be seen here in this review:"
2440,open-ended,B001HOD50K,taxcut 2008: Can anyone clarify that for me?,,TaxCut would allow you to print both Federal and State returns. Using e-File option is YOUR choice. TaxCut would NOT make you e-File. I hope this helps.
2441,open-ended,B001HOD50K,Schedule K-1: Does anyone know if 2008 TaxCut has been improved?,,I would say not much improvement. I'm hitting the same thing :(
2442,open-ended,B001HOD50K,State returns: Does anyone know how much it costs to download additional state forms?,,I have already downloaded my one state software. I tried to do another state and my TaxCut version (Mac Premium Federal + State) says it is $29.95 per additional state. Hope that answers your question.
2443,open-ended,B001HOD50K,"Is this for tax year 2008, or am I missing something ?",,That is correct. This is for filing 2008 tax returns (year end 12/31/2008).
2444,open-ended,B001HOD50K,explain how 5 free returns works. Can a friend load the software on her machine and do her taxes for free?,,"No - there can only be one user with the software loaded on one computer. But with this software I do my taxes, my son's, my mother's and a friends. So it's well worth it to me. Oh, you can have 5 electronic internet returns by entering the key code provided you on the software but you can do only 1 free state return. You can file additional state returns electronically by paying the state's filing fee on a credit card or you can just print them out and mail them. I've been using this product for probably 15 years now and never a problem."
2445,open-ended,B001HOD50K,Where is the MAC Home and Business version? Why has TC not produced a Home and Business version for MAC users?,,"since Mac OS computers only make up 4% of computers, its not really economically sound for them to invest money to do that. your learning the lesson of owning a mac, there is not alot out there for you."

Let them know what you want to do and they can help u that way. I know that cricut provocraft will not allow the SCAL w/ cricut. Their email address is support@craftedge.com
2450,yes/no,B001HWZ582,Does this work with expression 2?,N,"No. It does not. It works on the older expression and 6"" machines"
2451,yes/no,B001HWZ582,does it work on mac,?,It does but if you will have to get a special authorization code from the company

2453,yes/no,B001HWZ582,Will this work with a Cricut Mini?,?,"I downloaded it on my computer but never could get it to pull up so I email SCAL and they told me that it was not compatible to the cricut mini. I bought it because the information I read said it was compatible to all cricut, they fell to say all cricut except the mini, so I have a SCAL downloaded that I can't use on my mini."
2454,yes/no,B001HWZ582,Will this work with my Cricut Expressions2 ?,N,No
2455,yes/no,B001HWZ582,My Cricut Personal has firmware of 1.45. Will this work with Sure Cuts A lot?,?,"I think so, you can call Tech Junkies and he will be able to tell you. They walked me through everything"
2456,yes/no,B001IDTO4Q,is this compatible with windows 8,?,"As a former user of Calendar Creator, I wish I could answer your question. I abandoned CC in 2009 because of incompatibilities with my then Operating System, but mostly because I found the newer versions of CC far inferior to the much older CC2. I have pages and pages of emails with ""Brandy redux"" a Hoyle/Encore forum moderator (pine_97@yahoo.com - I have no idea if this email is still accessible), who spent countless hours of email time with me, as I poured out my frustrations with the inability of CC9 and CC12 to duplicate the excellent features of the earlier edition. I am the editor of our church newsletter, and I needed a workable calendar - I resorted to creating my own calendar template using Excel. Sorry I couldn't give a direct answer to your question. You might try the email address above to determine if ""Brandy"" still operates as a moderator for CC. jackolynh@aol.com"
2457,open-ended,B001IDTO4Q,why wont my events center in the event box when I have them set to?,,1. First select Entry. 2. Then click Ctrl+M on keyboard. 3. Highlight Text in description box. 4. Then click the center tool on toolbar. 5. Click OK Item centered in Calendar date box.
2458,yes/no,B001IDTO4Q,Will it run with Windows 7?,Y,Yes it will. I am running Windows 7 Professional 64bit. It runs well.
2459,yes/no,B001IDTO4Q,Will it run on Win 8.1?,?,"Thats what i am using. i had used an earlier version of the program that i liked better, but this worked. had trouble finding how to use photos, but then i put them on a flash drive and they were easy to use. had trouble finding them on my hard drive. works fine."
2460,open-ended,B001IDTO4Q,I use CC12 to keep my extended family's birthdays and anniversaries organized. I have multiple event lists with hundreds of events that repeat every year. Any recommendations for an updated program?,,Yes it would be nice to be able to scroll down a calendar on screen with the wheel on my mouse. One always has to go to the side and move the calendar manually which I find a pain.
2461,open-ended,B001IDTO4Q,Can this software make a 3-month or 4-month calendar on a single page?,,"No, I did not find that format."
2462,yes/no,B001KYJPZ6,I am happy with Auto Sketch 9. Is there any reason to replace it with Auto Sketch 10?,?,"Not unless you want to upgrade your os to windows 8 or your 9 installation doesn't,t allow you to open an skf file by double clicking it. There is very little difference between the two versions otherwise."
2463,open-ended,B001KYJPZ6,"First: Is this v.10 the latest Autosketch version? And secondly, will it run on Windows 7?",,Yes to both questions. I am also running this version on WIN8.
2464,yes/no,B001KYJPZ6,"Can all .skd files made by earlier revsion (for example, even as old as Autosketch 2.1) can be used by this one?",Y,The open menu shows skd V2.x as a format option so it looks like it will open version 2.1 skd files.
2465,open-ended,B001KYJPZ6,3D?,,I needed only 2D. Don't use it much. Found it easier to write algorithmic images using Matlab.
2466,yes/no,B001KYJPZ6,Will this work with Windows 8?,Y,yes
2467,yes/no,B001KYJPZ6,Can Autosketch 10 work on my Windows 7 64 bit computer?,Y,Yes
2468,open-ended,B001KYJPZ6,"after drawing a building detail, what formats can be saved....ie PDF word jpg etc?",,All of them. Just use Save As. For PDF use print thenselect PDF.
2469,open-ended,B001KYJPZ6,"after drawing a building detail, what formats can be saved....ie PDF word jpg etc?",,Save as an dxf then you can print to a pdf using the Autodesk viewer. I have not had very good luck going directly to a pdf from Autosketch.
2470,yes/no,B001KYJPZ6,Is it compatible with windows 8,Y,YES
2471,yes/no,B001KYJPZ6,will auto sketch 10 work on windows 7?,?,Its designed for vista and windows xp but i use it on windows 8.1 ok so i would think it will work on windows 7. There are of course no guarantees.
2472,open-ended,B001L8L3L0,When doing an edit in Vivesa from Lightroom 5.6 there is a big difference in color balance between the two *on the same calibrated monitor*. Ideas?,,I don't think there should be a smidgin of difference if the monitors were calibrated at the same time and with the same software under the same room lighting conditions.
2473,yes/no,B001L8L3L0,Can I use this with Elements 11? It is the only software I have.,N,"The specific software that is associated with this question is no longer available. If you're looking at a used copy or something, it only works with Adobe Lightroom and Apple Aperture. However, the current version of this software, not available through Amazon, as far as I can tell, can be purchased through Google. https://www.google.com/nikcollection/ The updated software works with Aperture, Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and other products. I would save your money, not buy this version, and purchase the modern one that will do what you want, and probably work a lot better."
2474,open-ended,B001L8L3L0,"I have CS5. Is it better to use the NIK suite in Photoshop, or in Lightroom? I assume you'd need to buy the suite twice to use it in both?",,In my opinion Nik is by far a more powerful instrument when used in Photoshop than LR.

2476,open-ended,B001LQO4P4,I have converted many video camera 8mm tapes to dvd's. But they don't play on my tv. They play on the computer. What is wrrong?,,The file format of the recorded material is probably incorrect. Double check what the file extension is on your digital file and see if you can convert it to a compatible file type.
2477,open-ended,B001LQO4P4,Why did Roxio Easy VHS to DVD for windows just stop working using Captue Audio from Sound Card,,"My Roxio version is easy VHS TO DVD 3PLUS, I have Windows 64, this program is very erratic, now it works next there's no video feed, just a green screen, duration time is unreliable, as I program a set time, it will tape a few minutes or an hour then stops. These are the problems that I have, I do not know about using Captue from Sound card."

2480,yes/no,B001LQO4P4,does this program remove copyright from vhs?,?,"I'm looking for the same answer. I did notice that the very early reviews of this product did mention that a screen popped up that said the material was copyrighted and, therefore, stopped. Unless someone can tell us otherwise, I suspect the answer is no. I have two old VHS movies that have never been released in DVD format and would like to preserve them for my own personal use only. Has ANYONE been able to copy commercial VHS movies to DVD with this program??? Thanks."
2481,open-ended,B001NK18FM,"This plus CS5? If my daughter has Photoshop CS5, does this add anything to her toolbox?",,"I think the main thing to keep in mind with Manga Studio is that it's a drawing program.. substantially different in intent and operations than what you might normally do with Illustrator or Photoshop. Illustrator and Photoshop are both hands down more powerful programs, and there isn't anything that Manga Studio can do that these can't, but the real difference is in how efficient Manga Studio is for the freehand artist specifically, increasing speed and productivity significantly for this type of application."
2482,yes/no,B001NK18FM,Does manga studio ex4 work on windows 8,?,Yes no problems at all.
2483,open-ended,B001NK18FM,what tablet should I buy for my daughter to use with this software. She is an avid manga drawer in paper. Please help,,"Really just about any sort of graphics tablet will be good, but I would recommend getting her a Wacom brand tablet. Even one of the cheaper Wacom tablets will be better and last longer than most other brands. One of the Wacom Bamboo tablets would be more than adequate for her if she is just learning how to use a graphics tablet. If she's a bit more serious about doing computer art, I would recommend getting her an Intuos- they have a few more features and are a bit more sensitive, but there's no reason to get her one that's more expensive if she's not sure she'll use it. Good luck! Manga Studio is my favorite program. If she likes to draw comics she will love this software!"
2484,open-ended,B001NK18FM,Works with Window 7? I noticed it doesn't say anywhere that it is compatible with Window 7?,,It does. I bought it a while back and it works perfectly with windows 7.
2485,yes/no,B001NK18FM,Could this be used to make single drawings?,Y,Yes it can.
2486,open-ended,B001NK18FM,"I don't draw everyday, but I draw often. I'd like to know if I should purchase EX or Debut? I do not draw manga, but I draw canines &amp; 4 legged animals",,"EX is the full package, with useful options Debut lacks. Despite the name, think of the software as meant for all kinds of comics (not just manga). If you want to make a comic, it's fantastic for that. However it does have tools for drawing, if that's all you need."
2487,yes/no,B001NK18FM,I click on install Manga Studio and it doesn't let me. Can you help?,?,What is your screen saying when you try to click it?
2488,open-ended,B001NK18FM,Where's the LONG serial number?,,I take it you mean the activation key? It's on a sticker on the disk.
2489,yes/no,B001NK18FM,Will it work with an older version of a Wacom Tablet?,?,"I own an older Wacom, the Intuos 2. It's over a decade old but works wonderfully with Manga Studio 4 EX."
2490,yes/no,B001NK18FM,Will this work with Windows 8?,?,It works with Windows 7 so I don't see why it wouldn't.
2491,open-ended,B001NK395Y,Why won't this program pull up my JPG/JPEG files? Help! Any suggestions?,,"cpg is the manga studio page file just like psd is the photoshop document file. (cst is the manga studio story file) Try opening a new page in manga studio than import an image like a jpeg. Or open a new page in manga studio and then scan in your image. You'll have a choice of making it either a sketch layer (which ironically is one you cannot draw on, but it is your sketch that you can ink with a new raster layer over it). Or you can scan it in as a raster layer and draw and edit right on the layer."
2492,open-ended,B001NK395Y,Does this work on a windows 8? and can i install the program from a website because my computer doesn't have a CD-ROM?,,"i believe it works on windows 8, but not sure about the cd rom, i doubt it since manga studio 4 programs are most likely discontinued, i could be wrong on that one though"
2493,yes/no,B001NK395Y,does this work for windows 8?,Y,Yes but I'd recommend getting manga studio 5 debut
2494,yes/no,B001NK395Y,We have NO internet access. Can this software be installed and used with out internet?,?,"I believe it can be used, however you may not be able to get the additional stuff that makes manga studio at it's peak... the only thing I may be able to suggest is to have your computer (im assuming laptop) at someone's place that would allow you internet, then you may be able to download the additional features, that way you can enjoy fully of the manga studio debut 4, it is a great program to have. I personally love it, and I hope you enjoy the same experience."
2495,open-ended,B001NK395Y,"Can you use any tablet, or only certain ones with this? We bought a bamboo tablet last year, I'm wondering if that one will work.",,Yeah it'll work so long as u have the bamboo programs installed and rdy to go u can use it ^^cuz I have one too and it works perfectly with it.
2496,yes/no,B001NK395Y,Does this product have paint stool included.,?,"Hi, The version I bought would not run on the PC. It never loaded or worked. It was a big waste of time and money."
2497,yes/no,B001NK395Y,can I download a free trial?,?,"Yes, you can go to the company website and download a free 30 day trial. However, at this price (currently $18) how can one lose? :D"
2498,yes/no,B001NK395Y,Do you need a drawing tablet to use this program? I am working off a Mac and I have yet to figure out how to draw a character in this program.,Y,Yes it gives more control than the mouse does
2499,yes/no,B001NK395Y,"are there templates in this dl for poses, hair etc?",N,Not that I've seen
2500,open-ended,B001NK395Y,Saving Small on Mac: Has anyone encountered this problem?,,"It sounds like you've got the setting of the dpi low on the default new files or story files. Other than that, there's a utility called lion cache cleaner(used to be leopard cache cleaner), that can fix randomly odd problems, though if it's a setting, I don't know if it will fix it."
2501,open-ended,B001OLZOW8,version of lightzone? what version of lightzone is included with toast 10 pro?,,"Don't know which version? I haven't checked, but it should tell you if you go in the About in the file menu. Did you even try installing it, or does it not say? In any case, you need serial number to activate it, or be a trial. Don't know if full or special, as Toast 10 Pro didn't come with a serial for it, at least not on my copy. That's probably because it was a trial to begin. I think you'd be better off with iPhoto (if you don't have Adobe Photoshop). That's Mac. On Windows, Microsoft's photo editor won't cut it--too simple, and often doesn't do what I want it to do. If worst comes to worst (that is, if you have a camera), try your camera's software. In the meantime, try it out, but I think that you'll probably find some free photo editors, such as try Download.com (CNET)."
2502,open-ended,B001OLZOW8,"Titanium Pro 10 - Mac: Can an original Blu-Ray movie, burned from this software on a Mac, play on consumer BR Players?",,"I bought a mac because I thought it would be better to make photo slideshow and video. I have been taking classes at the MAC store and have found that there is nothing that compares to Photdex Proshow Gold for the PC. I have spent months searching and was told by apple techs that if I want professional looking photos and video on my large screen TV I would have to buy the very expensive Final Cut and not the Express one because it has to go though iDVD which degrades the pictures. Tech even said ""iDVD just sucks"". Proshow is less than $100. I am very discouraged!!! Will Roxio solve this problem?"
2503,yes/no,B001OLZOW8,Is this product for a power Mac,Y,"What processor does your Mac have? If it's a G4 or earlier, you may need an earlier version of Toast. If it's an Intel chip, it should work. Check with the manufacturer."
2504,open-ended,B001P3O764,monthly subscription: Does anyone know what the monthly subscription for this service will be.,,"All in all, the 740 traffic is not good at all. I live in a very congested area of Central Florida, frequently driving both Orlando and Tampa. Very poor traffic flow coverage, non-existent for long stretches of I4 and I75. No secondary coverage at all. In comparison, MSNDirect has extensive coverage with full color-coded traffic speed data covering nearly all major highways in and around Tampa, including secondaries over 30 miles out. Orlando not quite as extensive, but still much better than the 740's traffic. If buying for this feature, my advice is don't."
2505,open-ended,B001P3O764,"Does anyone know what the current monthly subscription for the Live traffic feature is? I saw a similar questio, but the questions / answers both are",,Here is the BEST answer I can give you. It isn't worth it at ANT price. It NEVERS works so save your money. I can not tell you the nightmares I have endured with trying to get this miserable piece of junk's live traffic to work. . . over a period of YEARS and many RMA's. Don't bother.
2506,yes/no,B001P3O764,Is this work for a truck driver,?,Best one I ever had.

2512,yes/no,B001P6BFBQ,Does this program work on a mac ?,?,"I purchased it for a friend who hasn't tried it on a Mac, so I can't give you a definitive answer. However, as far as I know, it does not work on a Mac but was specifically designed for PC. Sorry I can't be more definite than that."

But without knowing that, I'd say WP12 is find with up to an XP. If you are using Windows 7 or 8, WP12 is probably not compatible."
2518,open-ended,B001PI8IJQ,how to reinstall a preinstalled CD of wordperfect. I mistakenly deleted,,Not quite sure what's preventing you from simply installing it as you did before. Unless you no longer have the requisite serial info or password to do so. I'm sorry I'm not very helpful. I can tell you that personally when I have had the need to install on a new computer and can't find either the disc or the info (which is almost always the case) I simply orflder a new one. The version I have isn't very costly and there are a number of places to find em. Good luck. Maybe you should ask a thirteen year old. I'm 50 and that's what I end up doing.

2522,open-ended,B001PI8IJQ,Does this product include Quatro Pro or an Excel type program?,,The version we purchased was WordPerfect 12 only.
2523,open-ended,B001PI8IJQ,I send email attachments in Word 10 to a computer that uses Word Perfect. When she opens the document its garbled. Why?,,It's possible you have a newer version of MSWord that isn't compatible with an older version of WordPerfect.
2524,yes/no,B001PI8IJQ,Can the OEM version be used on a machine it was not installed in by the manufacturer?,Y,Yes. If you have the disk and the key code. I successfully installed it on my new computer with no problem.
2525,yes/no,B001PI8IJQ,Can wordperfect 12 work on windows 8?,?,"I do not know if WordPerfect can work on Windows 8, but it works well on Windows 7. Alternatively, WordPerfect Office 5X can be purchased for under $75 and works well on both 7 & 8."
2526,yes/no,B001PIAUEW,I am an old-time Adobe PageMill user and what I have always liked about PageMill is that in addition to its excellent WYSWYG functionality you also have the the ability to work easily in a source-code mode if you wish.

2527,open-ended,B001PIAUEW,can I install this on both my laptop and my desktop (or re-install again if my computer crashes) or is the CD only good for 1 installation?,,I have re-installed the program after a computer crash. I suggest that you email Virtual Mechanics and ask them if you can install it on both a laptop and a desktop. The folks at VM are very nice and reasonable. Keep in mind that you will have to link your laptop and your desktop or you will have different programs and changes to one will not change the other.
2528,open-ended,B001PIAUEW,Anyone here try both Serif's WebPlus X6 and the latest SiteSpinner Pro? I am hesitating as to which to choose. I do no know coding at all.,,You do not need to know any coding to be able to use SiteSpinner Pro.

2534,yes/no,B001PIAUEW,Can SiteSpinner Pro be used to work with my site that I developed using Adobe Dreamweaver CS2?,?,"Hi Harry - I am pretty sure the answer is no to that one.

2535,yes/no,B001PIAUEW,Can I get any web host I want?,?,"I would reccomend strongly against this program. It is a very primitive program which is also hard to use.

The other thing that may work is the GARMIN dvd with life time update. I had to return my key since I was not able to install the update (original with life timeNorth America map preloaded, Europe on a one time SD card) The lifetime Europe update would not install. I had to call Garmin to confirm this."
2547,open-ended,B001PKTDMU,will this work with a nuvi 50lm and is it on a micro sdcard?,,Yes this update will work on your device. You need to resister the device on Garmin.com. Don't forget you still need to buy the European Maps for this update to work. Below is the link to the Micro SD card I bought on amazon. It will work on your device. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00200K1TS/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
2548,yes/no,B001PKTDMU,Is Iceland included in the Europe map,N,I don't know since I was not able to load the map into my GPS

Are these counties included in the maps?
2550,yes/no,B001PKTDMU,Is this a Micro SD card,?,One can order EITHER the download or the micro SD card. We received the Micro SD card which allows us to use in different GPS.
2551,yes/no,B001QUUEA4,do I need the headset?,Y,Yes

2553,open-ended,B001QUUEA4,I s there a naturally speaking app for kindle?,,"I can't answer because I have no clue. My sister gave me Dragon Naturally Speaking for Christmas several years ago, but it won't install. A notice saying ""Processor speed is inadequate for Dragon Naturally Speaking 10.1"" so I returned it to her."
2554,yes/no,B001QUUEA4,Will it work with Win 8,?,"Dragon NaturallySpeaking home version 12.5 works with Windows 8 in general. What I mean by that is that if you're using Microsoft products for example, word, excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint. It seems to work fantastically. In all other cases you will simply have to use the dictation box which is a part of Dragon NaturallySpeaking that can be used when the program does not allow for direct dictation. On the other hand if you have purchased Dragon NaturallySpeaking premium 12.5. This is the professional version and it is specifically designed to work with Windows 8 directly without frequent use of the dictation box. Finally to make myself clear if you cannot directly dictate in application all you have to do is say ""open dictation box"". This is if you're just using the home version, and if you happen to own the professional version of Dragon you should be able to dictate directly to a Windows 8 application."
2555,yes/no,B001QUUEA4,does it understand what you are saying most of the time,?,"I can't answer this one because a message showed up saying ""Processor speed is inadequate for the Dragon Naturally Speaking"" when I tried to download the appropriate software."
2556,open-ended,B001QUUEA4,"Dragon Naturally Speaking: Does it work with delays when the program is ""listening"" to me speak?",,"Why are you recording a recording? Usually when you record a class you just play back the tapes without re recording the whole lecture. Normally when I record a class I use my Sony tape recorder, not digital, and I label all the tapes I record. In this way I can select which lectures I want to listen to again. It seems you are doing double work."
2557,open-ended,B001RYFYYK,How do I download the DVD to the hand held GPS? I have the disc uploaded to my computer,,"Yes, like Richard says, plug gps into pc. Download and install ""Base Camp"" on your pc. Then you can either click the Icon at the top Base Camp tool bar to ""send to device"", or click on ""device"" and then ""send to device"". Some of the maps (City Navigator) have to be unlocked on line. Be careful, gps's will only hold a limited amount of maps. The Garmin Montana 650T will only display maps if there are less than 3,000 downloaded on it. 24K Region Topo maps have thousands of maps on them so you should only select areas you think you will need and download those maps. Too many and the gps will not work. All else fails, call Garmin support. They are pretty helpful."
2558,yes/no,B001RYFYYK,The image says it's the preprogrammed data card but the description says it's the DVD. Is this actually the DVD?,?,"David, My program was a DVD. I also have DeLorme software. MUCH BETTER... Don, Chandler, AZ"
2559,open-ended,B001RYFYYK,I misunderstood what I was getting when I bought this. I thought I was getting the GPS and the MapSource TOPO came with it. What do I need?,,"WHAT? the question is too vague? I can tell you this: I returned TOPO because I felt it was useless and the producers need to invest time and NOT rush there product to market in the version I had in order to make it truly beneficial. It is mostly featureless and ultimately useless, lacking trails, roads, land marks, etc. I hope that answered your question?"
2560,open-ended,B001RYFYYK,"Is this version 2.0? For those of you who bought this in the past year or so, which version did you receive?",,"I just ordered it today so I can answer the question in a few days. I did this based on an FAQ at gpscity.com about part 010-11314-50. They said they are the same map, the part number is different because of packaging. I ordered the southeast DVD from Amazon a while back. Part 010-11319-50 does not appear on anything I received but the DVD is labeled Version 2.00."
2561,open-ended,B001RYFYYK,"Does it come with hiking and trail maps? Otherwise, can you overlay trail maps? Looking mainly at California",,"It is a Topo map - but there are some trails. My experiences with it in Tennessee, Colorado, and Montana is that some trails are there, others aren't. It is sometimes surprising what will be there and the things that are not. If you intend to hike a national park, for example, it might be worthwhile to purchase a map for that specific park. For example, you can purchase from the Trailhead series. There's one for the Pacific Crest Trail, if that helps. Regarding a trail overlay - If you intend to load the Topo onto your GPS you need to check to see if it can handle the additional info. I use the Basecamp software from Garmin (free download) and with it you can install overlay information. You can also overlay aerial photography."
2562,open-ended,B001RYFYYK,"I want to buy the CO TOPO software for hunting, to tell me whether where I am standing is private/public/blm/Natl.Forest/Natl.P... Will this software do that and will it give me any info for the landowners if I am on public land? Thanks.",,No. Neither the maps or the trails on them are 100% accurate. And private lands are not usually marked.
2563,yes/no,B001RYFYYK,Is Idaho in west 24 k?,?,"You want TOPO US 24K - Mountain North, that has Idaho."
2564,open-ended,B001RYFYYK,"Do the topo maps show BLM or public land, and trail names",,"I think the garmin topo maps are just OK. Not enough detail for me. They show BLM land, but not enough trails for me. I ride dual sport off road. I purchased the DeLorme Topo v.10. Much better. Every trail, every view, great routing resources. Don Taylor, Chandler, AZ"
2565,yes/no,B001RYFYYK,"would it be a better plan to get topo usa, and download it the gagm1n",?,"The topo product for the whole US is a lower resolution (100k) compared to 24k, so you do not see as many topo lines, 2 tracks etc. But the big difference would be that the 100k version does not support 'routing' (at least it did not when I bought it), while the 24k one does. 'Routing' is where you select a Go-to location, and the GPS picks a road route for you."
2566,yes/no,B001RYFYYK,"Will this software run on Windows 8, 64 bit?",?,"Better call Garmin. They are pretty helpful and knowledgeable. As usual, don't use MSN browser, Firefox accesses and downloads Garmin products much better."

On the box it does specifically say that it can be used on Vista 32 and 64 bit versions. It does also list Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit). So you both should be just fine using it on whatever version you have.
2570,open-ended,B001U3PYLQ,Can this be used to extend your subscription for another year? I already have this and just renewed it for $69.99 for one year. can I buy this and add on to my subscription time?,,I don't believe so. You are better off buying a new version every year when your subscription runs out and paying around $30 or so (sometimes less if there is a rebate) than renewing/buying a subscription.

2576,open-ended,B001UHMVKO,I watched the demo. I saw SOME options for 10-key... how much 10-key lessons are there in this program?,,"The software provides many plans to work with. One is specific to Full Keyboard and has at least 10 lessons within it. Then there are Advanced, Sentences, Speed and Accuracy, Business and other plans that will make use of the full keyboard. I purchased this a while ago and it has certainly improved my typing ability greatly. Hope this answers your question."
2577,open-ended,B001UHMVKO,what is the age recomendation for this product? My son is 7. He wants to learn to type. thanks,,The box says 8 & up. It is great and it has some fun games that he would enjoy while learning.

2579,open-ended,B001UHMVKO,I am looking for an application to use at a corporate level. Does this software allow multiple users or is it a one user application?,,"I have an individual version which I can put on 2-3 systems as long as I am the user (or my kids), but there are multi-user licenses available for Schools, libraries and organizations, which I would assume are corporations. They have online versions and CD versions. If you buy an individual version, you will not be able to make as many copies as you want as it it requires a license key that is checked."
2580,yes/no,B001UHMVKO,Can you learn in Spanish ?,?,"According to the instructions on the box it says: Learn in English or Spanish"". I haven't tried it in Spanish though."
2581,yes/no,B001UHMVKO,Yes or no...does this cd work with windows 8.1 ?,Y,Yes. I have Windows 8.1 and it works fine.
2582,open-ended,B001UHMVKO,How engaging would this be for a 14 year old boy who gets bored easily?,,This is a great program for anyone who wants to learn how to type. Bought this program for the family and our teenage son is now a wiz typing on his desktop and laptop computer. He now types around 60-70 wpm. My wife uses the program also just to keep up her speed. She loves it. Good luck.
2583,yes/no,B001UHMVKO,can kids use this program?,Y,"Yes, definitely. I bought it for my son when he was in 5th or 6th grade."
2584,open-ended,B001UHMVKO,"Has anyone running Windows 7 64-bit had problems activating? If so, was it resolved? The possible solutions on their website didn't help.",,"Yes have Windows 7 64-bit and I could not activate it. It took a month, they sent me copy that required no activaction. So I'm not sure if it's the same copy I paid or not it's rather simple. I've had friends try to activate with no luck"
2585,yes/no,B001UXTIGS,will this work on computer with windows 8 ?,?,"Not sure fully as I didn't try it - only loaded on XP. There is a mode in Windows 8 which will allow old application to run in new OS - you should try that. From a WEB link ""The good news is that most software that runs in Windows XP should also work in Windows 8. If you hit problems with a particular application, try running it in Compatibility Mode. To do this, right-click its icon and choose Troubleshoot Compatibility - or search your computer for ""Run programs made for previous versions of Windows"". Follow the onscreen instructions to see if the application fares better with settings that emulate an older edition of the operating system. Good luck"

2630,open-ended,B0024M2T24,copy old write protected VHS movies to dvd: Can you copy VHS movies that have been write protected?,,I have the same question.
2631,open-ended,B0024M2T24,"What kind of VHS tapes can this device save to digital format? Can this take ordinary commercial movie VHS tape cassettes and put them on CD-R's or on DVD's, or is it just for Camcorder VHS cassettes?",,"Yes and yes as long as you can play the tape on your player (VCR, camcorder, DVD player, Tivo, and so on). It's not media or cassette type that is important. As this product comes with a digitizer, you can capture almost everything that has video output via RCA (yellow, red, & white) or S-video. Some camcorders only have RCA with yellow (video) and white (sound), which should work as well. I tried capturing PS3 game playing as video on this product, and it worked wonderfully."

VHS to DVD 4.0 is the market leader in video conversion, having sold 200,000 units since 2005. VHS to DVD 4.0 Plus provides everything you need to easily transfer your video into VCD, SVCD, and DVD movies with just a few clicks. VHS to DVD? Plus 4.0 includes a USB 2.0 video capture device and software to convert analog video to digital, or reformat digital video for recording on DVDs. PC users can either use the capture device interface or connect their digital video cameras and players to their PC to store the video. The VHS to DVD Deluxe 4.0 software formats the video for DVD players and recording devices. It also supports converting HDTV quality video formats including: HDV, VHS, C-VHS, Beta and other video and audio formats to DVD and Blu-ray DVD."

""I don't know what they're smoking over there at Vipre,"" I wrote to them in an email that I thought my secretary was sending to the bank. It was hilarious when you told the twists and turns to the story. Yes, they gave me my money back. A computer tech told me about the exe thing. I am content with Avast.

2683,open-ended,B00271L3BU,How do I avoid losing track for files using the proprietary database naming algorithm? I am concerned about being able to find and access files,,"Each of the items scanned are saved in the system as PDF files, so you always have access to the files. The idea behind Rack-2-Filer is that you have an organization for your scanned items. First, you create up to 3 different ""libraries"", such as Business, Personal, and Other, for example. You, then, create a digital ""notebook"" in one of the libraries. I think each library is limited to something like 1,000 notebooks. Then, you create ""tabs"" inside your notebooks, like you would put tabs in a notebook you'd use for school. Then, you open a tab and scan things under that tab as pages (either one-sided or two-sided). Each notebook can have up to 1,000 pages each. But, if you scan in 5 pages, then 3 pages, then a 1 page document, it saves each ""scan"" session as a separate PDF. So, if you want everything in one huge PDF file, you have to only start one continuous scan. Each new scan ""session"" is considered a new PDF. But when you review your documents under the tabs, you don't get the sense of where one PDF file ends and the next one begins -- you can only see that under Windows Explorer when you view the PDF files under the file structure. So, if you scan everything in 1 by 1, you could have 1,000 PDFs. If you scan one long, continuous scan, you only have 1 PDF, but both would look the same when you review them in a notebook. Hope that helps. If you have more questions, you can contact me at dennis.wiedeman@gmail.com"

Is it more than the visual appearance of binders on shelves in cabinets?,,"the visual is a nice pluss, and its for me easier to flip through the pages when I am looking for a certain item. for a windows wiz the windows folders may work nicely if you tag your scanned items with time and date in the folder name."
2686,open-ended,B00271L3BU,What is the total number of folders allowed in Rack2Filer version 5.0?,,"According to the help file 2115 folders of 1000 pages can be maintined: The data storage areas of the ""Libraries"", ""Cabinets"" and ""Binders"" are called ""LibRoot"" (Library Root). LibRoot folders can be set to any folder. * You can set up to 3 LibRoot folders. * In one LibRoot folder, you can create up to 6 libraries. * In one library, you can create up to 20 cabinets. * In one cabinet, you can create up to 21 binders. In total, up to 2,520 (6 x 20 x 21) binders can be managed per LibRoot folder in Rack2-Filer. Up to 1,000 pages can be managed in a ""Binder""."

2689,yes/no,B00271L3BU,Is it compatible with Windows 8.1?,Y,Sorry that I can't help you. I am very happy with my Scan Snap S1500 and the new software that I downloaded when I changed my PC from XP to Windows 7. I gave up on Rack 2 Filer within a few months of purchasing it. The quality of the charaters in the displayed text was very bad. I tried to find some technical support on the Internet but couldn't find anything. I guess that Fujitsu knew that they had a bad product and decided to hide. I suggest that you give up on it and just use the SnapScan.

2705,yes/no,B0027EQP56,can you do bank reconcilliations,?,"You can, but I am not formilar enough with the program to tell you how to do it"
2706,open-ended,B0027NARYC,PhotoSuite 4 says it does text. It doesn't ! . Any ideas. Trying to reach the makers of PhotoSuite is impossible.,,I sent it back !! That program doesn't even work anymore! I went to Roxio and bought their program Creator program . It meets my neads.
2707,yes/no,B0027NARYC,Does the MGI Photosuite 4.0 program need a registration key or serial number for installation ?,?,"It has been a long time since I worked with it, but I do not recall that it needed the key or nos. ."
2708,yes/no,B0027NARYC,Is the version compatital with windows 7,?,"Sadly, no.It was my go-to photo editor up to this point but not no more. I'd say I hope this helps, but I have to assume it disappoints. For what it's worth, I have found PhotoScape to be an alternative satisfactory enough to keep me going."
2709,yes/no,B0027NARYC,Does MGI Photosuite work on a MAC ????????,Y,"I don't know about Mac; I didn't think it worked on Windows 7 Professional, but with some tweaking if is sufficing. It is a great program and was WONDERFUL on XP."
2710,yes/no,B0027NARYC,Can this software add images into a text / letter / number shapes?,?,"I add them to e-mails without a problem. Or...put the picture from MGI into the point where you store pictures (My Pictures on AOL) and then just click on copy and insert the picture within the e-mail, or in any text."
2711,open-ended,B0027NARYC,"I have a bushnell imageview which I just purchased, there was no CD with it. The manufacture says to use Photo suite se 4.0 I run google chrome can this work on my computer or do I need another version",,I've been using PhotoSuite 4 since it came out ... was it 18 years ago? Used it for 8 years in a professional photography plant to doctor bad photos. It's fast and easy. I only used Adobe for fine sharpening and more accurate resolution changes and cropping. And I just used it on my new Windows Home Premium 7 Acer netbook. Works just like it always did. Next I'll try it on Windows 8.1.
2712,yes/no,B0027NARYC,Can you use on Imac?,?,"I can't say, I don't use a Mac. Ii dug out mine, and the sleeve only lists Windows operating systems.But, as my review says, based on my experience, it's a poor version of the program. I've used an old version for years, and love it. But I couldn't get this one to install. I tried it on two Windows 7 computers, and two XP computers. That problem may be unique to my disc, but it may not."
2713,open-ended,B0027NARYC,Compatible with Win 8?,,Sorry I can't help. I run windows 7. and it works on it.
2714,yes/no,B0028BYUBO,"I'm most interested in setting controls for use(can't use after 9pm,etc - only use for 1 hour..??",N,not this product. You can use your router to achieve this goal.
2715,open-ended,B0028BYUBO,How many computers can the software be installed on?,,"as many as you like but you have to use the installation key in every one you install this on , and its a great way to see whats going on on your computers"
2716,open-ended,B0028BYUBO,"I bought the 3.98 version and it said that it records key strokes BUT it does and when I emailed Infoworks they said I should get 4.41, so does this REALLY log key strokes",,"No, I had the same problem! Don't buy it...."
2717,yes/no,B0028BYUBO,does it work with windows 8,?,I can only say it works with Windows 7. It is a wonderful program and I really enjoy using. It is worth every penny you going to pay for it.
2718,yes/no,B0028BYUBO,will my kids know it is there???,?,"Hello-- to answer your question, no I don't believe they will know its there but likely you will not either, as in it didn't seem to work for me... I would not purchase it unless you are really tech savvy and know how to set it up to the highest setting. I suppose for myself I could have fiddled with it more, but I just went to Geek Squad and had what they recommended installed, that way I could get my questions answered. HTH"
2719,yes/no,B0028BYUBO,does it work on laptop computers?,?,I'd say yes but I wouldn't recommend the product.
2720,open-ended,B002A2YLB0,Trying to decide between DataRescue and R-Studio. R-Studio($80) gets lots of recommendations from my IT friends but need this for home use. Thoughts?,,"Sorry, I have no experience with R-Studio. The problem I mentioned in my review I found DataRescue worked beautifully. It may depend on the problem you are trying to solve. If your IT friends have found R-Studio helpful maybe they can coach you through your specific data recovery problem. Best, Richard"
2721,yes/no,B002A2YLB0,will it work for windows 8?,?,"Serene, I don't know. It worked well for me under XP. Richard"
2722,open-ended,B002A2YLB0,I need the Boot CD and Windows 8 compatibility? Is this version 3.2 even though it says 3.0?,,"Yes, this is version 3.2 (the most current version) and comes directly from Prosoft."
2723,open-ended,B002A2YLB0,"is the license just for a year like Steller Phoenix, or if I purchase the product can I use it indefinitely?",,"Its a perpetual License, ""forever"" or at least as long as the Company is in business. You have the option of copying the Software to your system as well. Hope this helps.. JEV in Orlando"
2724,open-ended,B002A2YLB0,Are you offering the latest version of the software or the old version: 3.0?,,"Please forgive me but this question is confusing to me? I am not offering either, I purchased the 3.0 and rated it but am not selling either?"
2725,yes/no,B002A2YLB0,"If a disk is password protected, will the software still be able to pull the files?",N,Password protected files can be pulled. encrypted files may be different and I was not able to to determine this.
2726,yes/no,B002A2YLB0,Will it work on an external hard drive? Accidentally made my external hard drive a recovery disk. Now all my data is lost on the hard drive.,?,"Have not used it for some time, but it worked on my external drive."
2727,yes/no,B002A2YLB0,"I have a hard disk taken from a not booting Win7 laptop. I used Win8 &amp; XP laptops with a USB adapter to read it, but failed. Can this software fix it",?,Based on my knowledge and experience with the Data Rescue PC v3.0 software to recover data and information from a similar hard disk drive situation I believe your drive can be recovered if the information has not been written over.
2728,yes/no,B002A2YLB0,Will this work on a computer that has been reset to factory condition? I need to retrieve a bibliography that was stored in Word.,?,I used the rescue software before resetting the computer. I believe resetting the computer erased all the files.

2730,open-ended,B002ABOYXG,what is the license deal? What's the deal here?,,"Just like you, I was totally confused. Enter the Product Serial # that is on the CD sleeve as the license number! Unfortunately, this information is not clear except for in the pamphlet included with the software."
2731,open-ended,B002ABOYXG,Why is it $32 here but $59 on the manufacturer's site? Is this the same product?,,Smith Micro usually has Pixelmator on sale. If you get their special e-mails it runs from 34.99-39.99 usually. I guess Amazon just has the hook-up so it is cheaper through them.
2732,open-ended,B002ABOYXG,So what version is this? 2.2??,,Not user friendly at all. Very hard to use and figure out.
2733,yes/no,B002ABOYXG,"will this ""old version"" work on a mac 10.6.8?",?,"Yup, that's what I'm running, ver. 10.6.8... on a duel core iMac. Hope that helps."
2734,yes/no,B002ABOYXG,can I use this on my mac mini,?,"Sorry, don't know the answer to that. Perhaps the Apple tech folks could help you."
2735,open-ended,B002ABOYXG,What version is this? I updated to 3.0 and hate it. If I installed an older version onto my mac would I be able to run it without having to update it to the newest version?,,"Not sure why you hated the version 3.0, but can tell you one thing I use it a lot and I like version 3.0 much more than this."
2736,open-ended,B002ABOYXG,"Box Product: Can I purchase the Box Product at Amazon, download the product from Pixelmator website and enter the License number.",,What version is this?
2737,open-ended,B002ABOYXG,photo editing: Pixelmator - does it do red eye reduction?,,"I don't have Pixelmator YET but am going to purchase it in the short term future. IPhoto does a great job of fixing red-eye. Just open your photo, select edit in the lower left of the screen & a red eye option comes up. You can either let IPhoto auto fix the red eye or you can manually fix it yourself. I think it works great!"
2738,open-ended,B002ASAEH4,Famly Tree Maker: Essentials vs Platinum versions: Anybody know the differences between the two versions?,,It looks like the Deluxe and Platinum versions come with a DVD that has digital copies of genealogy reference books while the Essentials version does not. The Deluxe has 10 books and the Platinum has 15. I am not sure if these are worth the upgrade or if they are available for free online anyway. Anyone know?
2739,open-ended,B002ASAEH4,New to Genealogy: Is this app considered user-friendly enough for someone who is just beginning to trace their ancestry and relatively ignorant in the field of genealogy?,,"FTM 2010 is, in my opinion, the best out there and I have been working on genealogy since 2000. Use the help functions, the on-line tutorials and go take a class on this software at you local history or genalogy center. I strongly urge a beginner to go take a basic genealogy class to get you started."
2740,yes/no,B002ASAEH4,Will FTM 2010 work in Windows7?,?,"I asked that question myself, here's the answer I received ""We appreciate your message. Family Tree Maker 2010 is compatible with and supported for use on both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows 7. If there is anything else with which we might assist you, please let us know.

2741,open-ended,B002ASAEH4,Importing data from an earlier version? Will this be able to import all my data from version 5 or will I have to re-enter it all?,,I have FTM version 6. I am planning on buying FTM 2011. I believe you have to back up your family file to a floppy disk and then import all the information when you have your new FTM software installed. At least I hope things go this smoothly. I've noticed that FTM is no longer made by Broderbund but a different company. I hope this doesn't cause a problem.
2742,open-ended,B002ASAEH4,Descendant Index/Report: Does anyone know if this is offered in the 2010 version?,,"If I understand your question, yes, and I am sure it was in my 2008 version, too. FTM 2010 is far superior to 2008. I suggest upgrading to the Essentials version. If I understand what you mean, in 2010 you go to the Publish tab, select Relationship Reports, and then OUtline Descendant Report. Presto...you are done."
2743,open-ended,B002ASAEH4,Why FTM and not just the online tree on Ancestory.com? What are the advantages of using FTM?,,"The biggest advantage for me with Family Tree Maker is being able to print out reports (ancestor based, descendant charts etc. that include siblings) to hold in my hand and look over while searching files on ancestry.com. You can print reports and books from ancestry but they cost you big time, which may be fine when you are all finished but not until then."
2744,yes/no,B002ASAEH4,"Question on Ancestry.com access: I see that FTM includes 1 - 3 months of access, but I wonder, do they make you give them credit card info to get this free access, i.e. try to hook you in anyway?",?,"I saw the following statement in someone else's review of FTM 10. Hope it helps. ""Do note that when you sign up for your ""free"" month with this software, you will be required to enter billing information and they will start stealth charging you when the free month is up - so watch for that. """
2745,open-ended,B002ASAEH4,Using with a Mackintosh computer? Have you used this software with a Mackintosh computer?,,"No, go to the FTM website and you will see that it is not listed for MAC."
2746,open-ended,B002ASAEH4,Upgrade from FTM 11 to 2010? Has anyone made the jump from 11 to 2010?,,"Sharon, i'm planning to switch from FTM 6.0 to 2010. How has your transition been? Thanks"
2747,open-ended,B002ASAEH4,Admin rights needed to enter data: Is it true that admin users are the only ones capable of entering data?,,"I don't know where you got this idea. Once the program is loaded and opened, anyone sitting at the keyboard can enter info."
2748,yes/no,B002CIP12U,Does Photomatrix come with any presets?,?,"Short answer: yes. Long answer would take more time than I have to answer, but here are the highlights (some derivations throughout a few of these) - photographic, creative, grunge, soft, surreal, enhanced, smooth, monochrome."
2749,yes/no,B002CIP12U,does this work with a canon 5d mark lll (full frame)?,Y,"Yes it does, I own that camera too."
2750,yes/no,B002CIP12U,Is Photomatix Pro 4 compatible with Windows 8?,Y,"Yes it is all day long but if l were you l would get the new version of Photomatix Pro 5 it also will work fine in widows 8 , welcome to HDR with the help of Amazon.com They are the best :) Hunter"
2751,open-ended,B002CIP12U,"I purchased photomatrix pro 4 in Febuary through Amazon,and I see that you can download version 5 for free.How do I download it?",,Go here: http://photomatix.com/download.html You will need the license code from Photomatix Pro 4.
2752,yes/no,B002CIP12U,I own vers 4. Is there a worthwhile difference between vers 4 and vers 5?,?,"I am not really familiar with version 4 but I can tell you that between Photomatix 5 and Photomatix Pro 5, about the only real difference is that pro allows you to work in batch. Each of the two can be run in either 32 bit or 64 bit. Each allow the user to make a quick photo-style selection (default, balanced, photographic, smooth ... etc) then manipulate manually from there to suit your taste. The results for the most part are generally pleasing. More recently I have added Pro Photo Editor and find that it is as easy to use but has a LOT more bells and whistles for even more pleasing results. Between that and Elements 11, There is little that can't be done to enhance a photo to exactly the shot you were looking for and are proud to publish."
2753,open-ended,B002CIP12U,"Do the 3, 5, etc.,bracketed images that are combined in this process need to be 'RAW' images or can they be JPEGs ? Is the final HDR image a JPEG ?",,"You can use either jpeg, raw or tiff as long as they are bracketed images"
2754,open-ended,B002CIP12U,is photomatix compatible with windows 8 and my cannon 650d and does it have a raw converter,,"Since I don't have Windows 8, you might want to check with their site for that info. But, it does not have a RAW converter, when I visited there last. The program takes the standard files from images. You can always find even free software to adjust and convert RAW files to use in this program to even better define your art."
2755,yes/no,B002CIP12U,Does Photomatix Pro 4 work with 32 bit processor?,Y,yes it does
2756,yes/no,B002CIP12U,Is there a plug-in version compatible with Lightroom 4?,Y,Yes
2757,yes/no,B002CIP12U,Do I have to have Photomatix 1 before I have this program? I do not have any HDR software.,N,No. It does not require an earlier version.
2758,yes/no,B002CMU748,Will this run on Windows 8?,N,No. ot dpesn't work on Windows 8 don't waste your money.
2759,open-ended,B002CMU748,what is compatible with windows XP?,,This worked on my windows 7 computer
2760,yes/no,B002CMU748,Does it really work for Vista?,?,i emailed the manufacturer...they said only the 5th edition will work with windows 7. everyone else on amazon seems to state it is not working right...i wish i knew b/c i have windows seven and would love to have this game!

2762,yes/no,B002CMU748,Will this work on a macbook pro?,?,Mine didn't work AT ALL. Not on my PC. Not on my Mac.

2764,yes/no,B002CMU748,Does it work for windows 7,N,No! Don't waste your money.
2765,yes/no,B002DHGMK0,I purchased a Asus laptop with windows 8 installed even through I had requested windows 7. Can I uninstall the Windows 8 and install this Windows 7 . From these reviews it seems not or almost impossible?,Y,"Yes, you can. However, I am very adept at computers(advanced user) and installing and uninstalling software and/or programs. If you wipe/uninstall you current copy of Windows, whatever the version, it will wipe your entire operating system. Taking with it the Asustek's(Asus) software and drivers for that particular model of laptop's drivers for the hardware found inside it. But, when I installed a new SSD(Solid State Drive) in my Asus G73Jh I installed a new copy of Windows 7 HP(Home Premium), which did NOT of course come with the unique drivers and/or software that comes with a particular brand's and model of laptop/desktop. So, you will have to visit Asus's official website(support) and download the individual drivers for the unique hardware found in your computer. Otherwise, many of the computers unique features that it may have will not function properly or at all. Visit this site: http://www.asus.com/support You can look up your specific model's drivers here. Good luck! Jeff"
2766,open-ended,B002DHGMK0,"What is the difference between this and ""Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 64bit (OEM) System Builder DVD 1 Pack"" ???",,"7 Home Premium is a 32 and 64 bit package, (2 discs). It is for the do it yourself person that builds their own. It can be transferred to another computer limited times. Example: I had one that was used every day, 3 years, finally became unusable. The next I built and used the OS from the latter. OEM: These are what retailers and builders use in their products, and add other software to it. They also have to provide support for the systems, example Dell. The OEM is ""married"" to the computer it is installed in, used only for that system and will not be genuine in any other. If it is installed in any other, Microsoft will not support it. IE. no up dates , nothing. You are also supposed to have a builders certificate to purchase this. Why this package is available to the public I do not know, with the restrictions it has. The price as you can see is taller for the full version."
2767,yes/no,B002DHGMK0,Can I install this on more than a single computer?,?,"Not at the same time. You can install it on as many as you want ONLY upon contacting Microsoft and having them reset the key. This is because the key is locked to the motherboard. This is different from the OEM version which can NOT be reset even by contacting Microsoft. Let me clarify. The OEM version is permanently locked to the motherboard or pc it was installed on and cannot ever be installed on another computer. The normal and more expensive version (the one I purchased) CAN be installed only on ONE computer at a time. In order to install it on a second, or third, or etc. it wil have to be removed from te previous computers and you will then have to call Microsoft and tell them you are going to install it on a new PC. They will at that time RESET you key so it can be installed on another PC."
2768,open-ended,B002DHGMK0,Will I be able to use this on multiple computers? Will one purchase be okay?,,"To the best of my knowledge, if you buy a copy of windows 7 OEM, when you install it on a machine with the provided key, it is then ""used"", and your key is tied to that specific motherboard for good, and cannot be used on any other computer. When you buy the more expensive RETAIL version, the key is tied to the user, YOU can use it on as many computers as you want, but it can only be installed on ONE computer at a time with either 32 or 64bit. You cannot install one retail copy on two machines. If you want to replace your machine, you can remove/uninstall it from your old one and install it on a new machine. A virtual machine counts as a seperate machine, even if it is the same computer. You cannot install/clean install for an OEM key if the motherboard is different than the original one that the key was used on."
2769,open-ended,B002DHGMK0,"I have a dell ultrabook with windows 8, I don' like. I want to put windows 7 on it, can I do the upgrade or the full version?",,I am not very clever about computers. I'm 70. My daughter thought the full version was the way to go. I got Windows7 Home Premium and she installed it without any problems. This computer came with Vista back in 2007. Vista was fine but it gave up the ghost last fall. My husband got Windows8 (all they are selling at local computer stores) and installed it. Not easy to install and horrible to use. Three months was all I could take. Good luck.
2770,open-ended,B002DHGMK0,I have a new dualcore laptop that came with Windows 8. I want to replace this OS. Which Windows 7 Home Premium Version would you recommend I use?Ted M,,"Before you install a new OS, you always want to create or keep a Recovery Disk of your actual OS that came with your computer before you proceed to delete it just to be safe in case you want to recover it. And I also believe that before you install a new OS, you probably will have to do some kind of clean installation or some kind of reformatting or something like that. You may want to do some further research of how to delete an OS and install a new one the proper way. Hope it works."
2771,open-ended,B002DHGMK0,Why is Windows 7 Home Premium almost twice as expensive as Windows 8.1 Full Version?,,"First of all I am not positive, but this and from what I researched online Microsoft is trying to push windows 8.1 ""just look at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/buy"". The second reason is the amount of windows 7 retail boxes are becoming rare. OEM is still cheaper but it has several disadvantages license-wise. -Answer update(1/29/2014): Microsoft stop selling to retailers full versions on October 30th 2013, See http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-windows-7-retailers-sales-deadline,25326.html -In general Microsoft will stop selling full versions of all mainstream OS software a year after a new version is released. So if windows 9 was released today windows 8 will stop being sold some time early 2015 OTHER WARNINGS!!!!! Look out windows 7 oem lisences are next to go Microsoft is planing on possible ending those to buts its ""to be decided"" -I might pick up some 3 packs of oem so that I can sell them after they become rare too. If I have the money. Even though OEM is not as good as Full in terms of flexibility."
2772,open-ended,B002DHGMK0,XP and 7 working together: What I would like to know is if you can have both Win XP and Win 7 installed via dual boot capability?,,"Got a bad news for you sir. You can run dual OS in one computer but you have to have your window xp and window 7 disc. You first need to install window xp and in the partition section, make it half of you hdd(non partition part not included). Then run window 7 and partition the remaining space ledt on your hdd. You can you a virual machine to run XP stuff but virual machine is VERY low and it depends on if you CPU, RAM and HDD can handle it or not"
2773,yes/no,B002DHGMK0,can you use many time as you want,?,I believe the directions state 2 or 3 times.
2774,yes/no,B002DHGMK0,Is this set licensed for personal computers (not resale) to install on new hard drives (afater a crash),?,You can install this on any computer you want. But only one at a time.
2775,yes/no,B002DHGM50,XP Home to Windows 7 Pro? Is it possible to upgrade it to Windows 7 Pro.,?,Yes you can buy the Windows 7 Pro upgrade for XP Home. Please make sure and run the Window Upgrade Advisor though to make sure your system will be able to run it. This is because most pre-made XP Home computers are under-powered to make them cheaper. They may not have enough memory or an Aero compatible video card.
2776,open-ended,B002DHGM50,Anyone but me wonder why I haven't been notified that my pre-order has shipped? Anyone else?,,"Here is the email Amazon sent me in regards to late shipping. From what I have read this should not apply to you because you did not choose Super Saver Shipping. Which makes me believe the email is just a smoke screen and something is screwed up... Amazon's story to me: I ordered early, choose super saver shipping, and because of where I live (San Diego CA?) they wont ship the product until five days after release even though the product page says in stock and shipping now. What's up now Amazon? ================================ Thank you for writing to us at Amazon.com. I truly understand your concern. First let me apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please allow me to explain what actually happened. I have researched your order(#############), and can confirm that we still expect to ship your order by the date listed in Your Account: October 26. The estimated date of shipment was calculated at the time you placed your order and is based on the availability of the items in your order, the proximity of inventory to the delivery address you provided and the shipping method you chose. Further, I see that the shipping method selected for this order is our free Super Saver Shipping option. We offer free Super Saver Shipping as an option for customers who don't mind waiting a little longer to receive their items in exchange for getting free shipping. When you select Super Saver Shipping during checkout, the final page of our order form displays the estimated date of shipment for your order. Although this is only an estimate--your items may ship sooner--if the date doesn't meet your needs, you can change the shipping speed before submitting your order. You'll find a link to the details of our Super Saver Shipping offer on the detail page of every eligible item. As noted in the offer details, ""your order may take an additional 3 to 5 business days to ship out from our fulfillment center(s). Transit time for Super Saver Shipping orders is 5 to 9 business days after shipping."" This delay can occur at various steps of the fulfillment process; the extra time allows us to process and ship your order in the most cost-efficient way available, and enables us to pass the savings, in the form of free shipping, on to you. Due to this reason, we encourage our customers to review the last page of the Shopping Cart order form before submitting an order. This page displays the estimated date of shipment and indicates how many shipments will be created for the specific order. If the shipping date and number of shipments is unacceptable, you can change the shipping speed or delete any items that would take too long to reach you."
2777,open-ended,B002DHGM50,32 bit or 64 bit: What version are you selling?,,"I'm waiting for Microsoft to update their store: http://store.microsoft.com/microsoft/Windows-7/category/102?WT.mc_id=winonline_win7promo If I don't see mentions for separate versions, my guess is that both are included on the upgrade media. That said, there's a tiny chance that the upgrade is 32 bit only, but I really hope that is not the case. EDIT: According to http://www.staples.ca/ENG/static/static_pages.asp?pagename=win7 , ""Product includes both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7."""

Hardware virtualization is usually not supported in older processors. Even if your processor would support hardware virtualization, there also needs to be BIOS support for it. Examples of processors that support it are the Core 2 Duo E8500 and the recent Core i3/i5/i7."

A few months ago, I bought a Dell XPS running Windows 7. I don't have the discs for Lotus 5.0, so I copied all the Lotus files to the new machine (which is what I had been doing each time I upgraded my computer over the years), and tried to run 123, but it wouldn't work. I kept trying different options, but nothing worked. Then I purchase Windows 7 Ultimate, which lets you run Virtual Windows XP, but I still couldn't get 123 to run. Last week I purchased on Ebay a copy of Lotus 123 5.0 on 3.5"" discs (!!!), and it was brand new in the box, which was pretty cool. About an hour ago, I decided to try and install it: popped Disc #1 (of 7) in and let the install program do it's thing. After it installed, I tried to open it in Virtual XP Mode, and amazingly !!! it worked just like it was supposed to. Don't know if this will help you or not - there are still quite a few people using 123 5.0 who have run into this problem - some have gotten it to work, others not. Good Luck! Bill Schroeder"
2780,yes/no,B002DHGM50,does this work for upgrading from windows xp professional,Y,"Yes, this will work to Upgrade to Windows 7 Professional. Here are a couple of things to consider and make a decision on.., How old are the Hardware on your Computer and it's Capacity, such as the Memory, Hard Disk Drive Size, Free Space & Condition. With Windows 7 Professional 64 Bit it will make use of (4Gb Memory and Larger), Windows 7 Professional 32 Bit (Maximum Memory Usage is 4Gb). So, evaluate what you have, what you want the computer to do for you, what you can afford and if what you have now will last your through a reasonable life span. PC Clones are allot more flexible on hardware and cost, you just will not have the OEM Technical Support. If you are savy with computer hardware and software you can save money by assembling/ building your own computer. Good Luck"

Does anyone know if the Windows 7 Professional Upgrade CD will work with my very old Windows XP SP1 Upgrade CD (i.e. the one I bought to get me from 98 to XP)?",,"You CANNOT do a ""clean"" install with this upgrade disc - you have to load XP first, then load the Windows 7 upgrade. If you're looking for a clean install, buy the Windows 7 OEM version - it's now about the same price or cheaper and you won't spend all day with your tech support because the activation code won't work."
2782,open-ended,B002DHGM50,How many computers can be upgraded with this product?,,The box says for use on one computer or device.
2783,open-ended,B002DHGM50,Can you upgrade directly from XP Pro Retail? Will it work for the -7 Premium?,,You'll probably have to back up your XP stuff (pics and things of that sort) then do a clean install. That's what you have to do with the RC so one can only assume that the retail product will require the same.
2784,yes/no,B002DHGM50,Is this a multi language upgrade? I want the norwegian verson,?,"All languages have been included with Windows for years as far as I know . The key is changing to your language and keyboard layout at the first screen. If you're upgrading, it should detect your regional settings and use them during the upgrade process. I've only ever used English, so I'm not speaking from experience."

For example you are in your program files folder... in the explorer/address bar ti will show: My computer --&gt; Drive C --&gt; Program Files. If you just click on Drive C, or My Computer, it will put you at the next highest level of the file structure! Don't know if that's what you're looking for, but that's what I got out of your question! -b3orion"
2786,yes/no,B002DHGMVY,Is GLC-00182 the FULL version: Is GLC-00182 the FULL version and NOT the upgrade?,?,"If the version of Windows is an upgrade version, the box will read ""Upgrade"" at the upper left corner. If the box does not read ""Upgrade"" and you received an upgrade DVD (or MSDN activation key), the software you purchased is a counterfeit. Before you open up your package, it will be advisable to check the Microsoft Website for the genuine features on the COA. The COA is ***never*** sloppily made. The silver line is visible by two rectangular shaped openings (counterfeit products usually have portholes, ovals, or irregular shaped openings). I hope this helps."

2790,yes/no,B002DHGMVY,Is this item sealed retail box without open?,Y,"IF it was supplied by Microsoft, yes. If supplied by ProducedByAli, it might be suspect even if it is in the sealed box. Hope this helps."
2791,open-ended,B002DHGMVY,Why is this one $424.95? and the others on amazon are $199 or less?,,"Be careful, the one I bought had code that only worked for a few weeks, they wouldn't give me a valid key after purchase either. The price does not guarentee it comes with a activation key, you may have to purchase that from microsoft later."
2792,open-ended,B002DHGMVY,well it work on multiple like 2 unit to be down load?,,"I'm not sure about multiple that you're talking about. I bought the item physically with 2 CD's (64-bit & 32-bit). Maybe you can install it in 2 PCs, but for sure that one would be considered as a pirated."
2793,open-ended,B002DHGMVY,What games no longer run in Windows 7?,,I have not seen any games that I own that does not work with Windows 7. Even some really old ones.
2794,open-ended,B002DHGMVY,Seller: DirectWin7 Can they be trusted? Have any of you seen this seller's prices for Windows 7 full editions?,,"I am seeing TONS of ""just launched"" new sellers selling windows for a very low price. I wouldn't trust them! They have no track record. It looks VERY suspicious. They're probably selling some kind of pirated copy. Bunch of losers."

Would like to use 64 bit OS...?",,My preference is fo OEM over upgrade but back up your data first of course. Can't guarantee everything (sw/hw) will work going from 32 to 64 bit but there are usually workarounds.
2797,yes/no,B002DHLV8S,"can i do a ""clean install"" from windows vista home premium to windows 7 ultimate upgrade?",?,"For some reason Windows 7 would rather upgrade from Vista to 7. If you try a clean install 7 will ask for Vista disk, load some of it and move on back to 7. Why, I really don't know BUT the Vista to 7 upgrade went fantastic and I have had no problems."
2798,open-ended,B002DHLV8S,how many computers can i load the upgrade on?,,I believe this upgrade is a single user license (it says so on my box) but you should check with Microsoft.
2799,yes/no,B002DHLV8S,"License question: My question is, if I upgrade the new computer to Windows 7, can I then renew the registration of Vista on the old computer so I can sell the old one with an OS installed?",?,"from my understanding of the numbering process, in one word, the answer is NO..........if you upgraded your Vista to Windows 7, then the number attached to Vista is now invalid and can not be made valid again"
2800,open-ended,B002DHLV8S,"Is an upgrade easier to do than a custom install? If yes, for an upgrade must I get Windows 7 Ultimate since I have Vista Ultimate?",,An upgrade keeps other programs installed on the computer intact with no need to locate installation disks for those programs so in my opinion an upgrade is the preferred way to go. I am not sure if the upgrade must be from ultimate to ultimate version. My upgrade was from vista ultimate to windows 7 ultimate which was problem free.

(since my vista business is an upgrade) and i don't want to re do my computer again. I just put the beta version on, will there be a way to just put in the cd key? Thanks"
2802,open-ended,B002DHLV8S,Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade Discount? Why isn't the pre-order for Win7 Ultimate Upgrade discounted the way the other 2 editions are?,,The reason there is no pre-order for the Ultimate Upgrade is because it is a limited edition SKU. Microsoft stated that Windows 7 Ultimate would be sold in limited availability.
2803,yes/no,B002DHLV8S,will this upgrade from 7 pro?,?,It will upgrade from Windows 7 Pro
2804,open-ended,B002DHLV8S,Why is the Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade nearly twice as expensive than the full version of Windows 7 Ultimate? That seems backward.,,"Hi, you may be looking at an OEM version or a counterfeit version, which is very likely with an unusually low price like that."
2805,open-ended,B002DHLUWK,"I justo order my Win7, how do I know if is it 32 or 64 bit ????? , any way to know this?",,Is this version 64 Bit?
2806,open-ended,B002DHLUWK,Only works for 1 computer? Seems like the key would only work once?,,"I don't believe you can install a single license on more than 1 computer. Once you activate it, it will keep track of your system, including hardware, to determine if you're trying to install it on another computer. That's probably why it wouldn't allow you to activate the second laptop. If you reformat the laptop you already installed it on, you should still be able to use the product key to reinstall it. Under XP, I had a full, non-upgrade license that I installed and reinstalled countless times on my custom PC. After upgrading the hardware on my PC several times, it wouldn't let me activate it over the Internet and I had to phone them. I imagine Windows 7 will be somewhat similar but won't know for sure until some time passes and people attempt their reinstalls. It's too bad you didn't know ahead of time, but a Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack (3-User) is probably what you should have purchased."
2807,open-ended,B002DHLUWK,When will Release Date shipping go out? Are they planning on using 2 or even 1-day shipping for everyone that chose RD shipping?,,"I selected standard free shipping, so the estimated shipping date is shown as October 26. Now I pre-ordered back in July, so they've known about my order for over three months. And yet their plan is to wait 4 days after the product is released (and probably about 7 days after they actually get the product) to ship it to me. Why the wait? Simple. To punish me for not paying extra for release date shipping. I don't have a problem with using the slowest/cheapest method of shipping, since that's all I was willing to pay for. But waiting to ship just because I didn't pay extra is just abusive."
2808,yes/no,B002DHLUWK,"Would've pre-ordered at $50, but at $120 Eff that! What's with amazon or microsoft upping their price by almost 2.5x???",?,The $50 thing was a special limited time offer. $120 is the actual price of the upgrade. Snooze you lose!

2810,yes/no,B002DHLUWK,So just want to clarify before I blow over $300.According to questions and answers I've seen here. I can do a upgrade (not lose all my other programs) with this software since I am upgrading from a 32 bit Windows Vista Home Premium version. Would...,?,"I upgraded from Windows XP. It backs up everything, installs windows 7,and then reloads everything back in. I am also going to do it to a windows Vista machine. I bought a brand new upgrade version of Windows 7 off of Ebay from a company in the UK and it only cost me 154.00 American dollars. That included shipping. My first copy I bought off of Amazon and it cost 210.00 dollars. Do some research and you might be able to save some money. The upgrade version does all the hard work for you, the factory version does a clean install and won't back up anything first. Hope this info helps and good luck."
2811,open-ended,B002DHLUWK,Able to install on multiple computers? Will 1 package be able to be installed on multiple computers?,,"What happens if I buy and install this, but later I upgrade my PC? Will it not let me install it again because it thinks it's a different computer?"
2812,open-ended,B002DHLUWK,How many computers can i upgrade with this version?,,Legally just one.
2813,open-ended,B002DHLUWK,Buy now and FREE upgrade to Win8? If I were to buy this now will I get a free upgrade to Win 8?,,"Well, back in 2009 if you bought a Windows Vista PC starting from late June you could get a free Windows 7 upgrade, so probably in this case they will do the same from Windows 7 to 8 but in your case you won't qualify since you need to buy a new PC."
2814,yes/no,B002DHLUWK,I wish to go from Windows Vista HomePremium 64-bit to Windows 7 HomePremium 64-bit. Is this the product I need?,Y,"Yes, that is what I used to upgrade from Vista to Windows 7."
2815,open-ended,B002DHLVII,32 or 64 bit? Which version is it?,,Each version of Windows 7 comes with BOTH the 32 and 64-bit discs. They're on seperate discs but your product key is interchangable (you cannot instal 1 machine with 32-bit and 1 with 64-bit however). I just got my copy of 7 Professional through the MSDNAA and I have to tell you: BEST OS from Microsoft yet!
2816,open-ended,B002DHLVII,Is this retail or oem? Does it have to stay on the first computer I load it on or will Microsoft let me move it to another computer in the future?,,"Mine was retail. You will have to make sure that you do contact Microsoft if & when you want to move it to another computer. My license is for only ""1"" computer. I do have an OEM copy that has not been opened or used that is designed for system builders that I will sell for $150.00 & you pay shipping. Did I give you enough?"
2817,open-ended,B002DHLVII,Why is the old version selling for more than three times that of the SP1 version?,,"Hi, I believe you are referring to the OEM versions marked as SP1? OEM versions are not equivalent to retail versions as they do not come with transfer rights; you may not move your installation to a new computer. Also, most of the Win 7 items on this listing will be SP1 as both SP1 and non-SP1 Windows 7 retail are the same part number. Hope this helps!"
2818,open-ended,B002DHLVII,"I've had to have my HD wiped and am starting brand new. I want MS os7 Pro 64bit, but want to make sure I get the correct item with the ""key"". Seeing too many versions, ie. ""Full"", ""branded"", ""OEM"". What do I need to get? Your advise is appreciated.",,This is what you want. I used this dor my last gaming rig. It came with both 32 and 64 bit as well as the key.
2819,open-ended,B002DHLVII,is there any other reason I would want a retail copy vs. OEM other than Microsoft support?,,"OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Retail versions except for the following, and very important information. 1- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel 2- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on. You cannot reuse your license code to reinstall on a new machine, and since you don't get free support, to attepmt to get Microsoft to release your license will cost you a support fee. 3- OEM versions will not allow you upgrade your motherboard, which could be a draw back. 4- OEM versions cannot be used to upgrade from an older version on Windows. Basically, the retail version will give you the ability to continue using the OS and license when you upgrade to a new machine, or hardware."
2820,open-ended,B002DHLVII,This is the NON-OEM version?,,Yes. Also known as the Full version. 32-bit and 64-bit CDs are included.
2821,open-ended,B002DHLVII,"what program do i need to print envelopes, letters? this was on my old computer under microsoft works",,"Microsoft Works is an abbreviated version of Microsoft Office. Therefore Works will save you some money. Microsoft Office is the gold standard and can be pricey. If you are a student, you may be able to purchase Microsoft Office through your school at a deep discount. Alternately, the trend is toward cloud-based subscription services that you subscribe to; not unlike your virus protection software. Windows 7 is an operating system that must first be in-place before you attempt to use word processing, spreadsheet software, databases etc. Think of it as your software foundation."
2822,open-ended,B002DHLVII,I'm needing to upgrade several computers at a local library ... would this work for that? How many computers can this be loaded onto?

Home version was available for three seats."

However, it was somewhat difficult to navigate through the settings on their website to do it. As long as you can provide something that shows you purchased the product, the manufacturer will provide you assistance. (If you purchased it through Amazon, it will be on record anyway.)

2835,open-ended,B002I0HJRM,window xp user: Anybody out there not have any issues?,,"When I first installed it on my Xp and on my Vista machines I had no problems. But incrementally, things got worse and worse. One XP machine got to where it took 10-15 minutes to re-boot. When I got Windows 7 I had to upgrade to 2010. Same thing. All of a sudden my machines got fast and that was my first clue Kaspersky was causing my problems. Then after a month all started running slower and slower. My XP machine even got blue screens and froze up. I removed it from every machine and installed Security Essentials. All machines have been running smooth and fast for 2 months now. So 2010 is worse than 2009. I HAD been using Kaspersky for 3 years without problems before this fiasco."

I don't see any Vista problems yet, though the sandboxed IE8 does run noticeably slower--though not horribly slower.

2846,yes/no,B002J1UJ4A,Is this the 7.0.3 version???,Y,"Yes this is the 7.0.3. I bought it in 2011. If you are just starting though you might want to get Final Cut X. It's a different platform that should help grow with your needs. That said, if you are trying to re-edit footage originally done in 7.0 then you will need this software since X will not accommodate anything from before. I hope this helps."

I use FCP7 which includes Motion 4, Soundtrack Pro, and some other tools that will help you create movies. I have not felt the need yet to update to FCPX.

2888,open-ended,B002JB3CUS,Paperport Alternatives? Are there any better alternatives to Paperport?,,"I have been using Paperport since the Visioneer days. Since Nuance took over, I have had nothing but grief with this product. It was constantly freezing in scan mode, sometimes freezing the entire computer. I have been living with it because I like the Explore like interface. Our small business is very scan dependent. When we had three clients screaming at us for their files, it was the last straw. I did a search and found FileCenter. We downloaded the trial, and just purchased the Pro version after an effortless changeover. The interface is fresher, new-looking and intuitive. There has not been a single glitch and effortlessly connected to the TWAIN driver of our multi-function Kyocera. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a PP alternative. You can find them at www.lucion.com or Amazon."

I am thinking of dumping all my old win 98 equipment and upgrade to windows 7 in October and move all my scanned images to PP12. Firstly I need to know that PP12 is stable and secondly, how I can move my old max files into PP12 without having to import them one at a time-ie., I have heard that all I need to do is throw the data folders into a master folder and then point PP12 to it for bulk import. In doing that, is anyone aware as to whether PP12 will look into the folders and files and extract the document names and bring them into PP12 as such? Thanks so much for any responses. Take care."

This windows 7 home to ultimate is for a upgrading lower functioning version of windows 7 to a higher version of windows 7. If you have windows vista ultimate, you do not have windows 7 - not windows 7 home, and not windows 7 ultimate. As I understand it, you need to know first if your windows vista ultimate is 32 bit or 64 bit. (microsoft.com tells you how to find out which you have - ask this question to bing.com to find out) Then you buy the windows 7 ultimate upgrade for either the 32 bit or 64 bit - whichever matches the one you started with on Vista. Doesn't matter that you have a Dell computer. I know that Dell's windows disk doesn't work on any other computer - it's not designed to.

2906,yes/no,B002K7C1HG,can you upgrade from windows xp to windows 7,N,"Sort of. Windows 7 Upgrades are designed for Windows Vista, keeping your files and programs in place. If you have XP, you will not be able to perform that same type of upgrade directly. Instead, you can do what is called a ""Clean Install"" which will move your files to a Windows.old folder, but you will need to install all of your programs again. I'd also like to point out that you cannot use this Anytime Upgrade to go from XP to Win7. This product is strictly to upgrade from Windows 7 Starter to Windows 7 Home Premium; if you do not currently have Windows 7 Starter installed, then this product will be of no use. Try searching for ""Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade"" as that includes the DVDs so you can do the Clean Install."

2908,yes/no,B002K7C1HG,Can I use this on a 64-bit operating system?,N,"I think so, but more than likely you will only utilize 32-bit of your system. I suggest you look into an upgrade for 64-bit systems only."

I upgraded my wife's netbook to Win7 Home before I ever tried to use an external DVD drive on her machine, so I'm not sure if I ever would have had issues with the starter edition. Since then, however, I've used a DVD drive to install lots of other software to that machine. I would suggest working through this troubleshooting checklist before spending any money on the Win7 upgrade: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/acer-netbook-with-windows-7-starter-does-not/bf1fbbd5-bec7-4055-b3d7-2d5853d06903?page=3"

2912,open-ended,B002K7C1HG,My netbook does not have a DVD slot. Can I download this software off the net or will I have to get an external DVD drive/reader?,,"Yes, you will download the software from the net.

2913,open-ended,B002K7C1HG,How do I remove the old window and install the new,,The upgrade software itself will take care of all that you do not have to remove anything

2916,open-ended,B002KG02QO,"Hello, I am really confused here. At the Apple store, they sell... How can you charge so much more, please?",,"Agreed. I'm wanting to upgrade from Leopard to Snow Leopard and then possibly Lion. Purchasing both Snow Leopard and Lion from the Apple site/Mac App Store is cheaper than buying Snow Leopard here.

Guitar Method v5.0b works correctly.

I also bought this $6 adapter so I can connect my mono microphone to my computer stereo connector. Otherwise, I only get sound from the left side: Free Shipping!! Metal 6.35mm (1/4Inch) Mono Plug to 3.5mm Jack Adapter If you're just going to hook up your guitar, just get the first $6 cable.

On the main screen it shows right handed chords. So does the chord dictionary. BUT the fretboard can be displayed at anytime and it has a left handed view, that shows how each chord would be played from that position. So, it would be a bit more messing around for you than me to get going on it, because you'd have to compare it to the left handed fretboard, but very doable. Hope that helps you!"
2997,yes/no,B002LLFAKG,Will emedia Guitar method be instructive for a 12-string guitar?,?,"Only if you play the 12-string as a 6-string guitar.

3009,yes/no,B002LTJIAG,Will I be able to use this with Windows 8?,?,"QH&B 2010 is no longer supported. You can install the software, but I don't think Quicken will confirm that it works with Windows 8. Your best bet is to get 2013, but verify on their website if it is compatible with Windows 8.

3015,open-ended,B002MV2MG0,What is with the price?,,"Amazon is not getting away with it, it's one of their partner sellers. Do you know and can you tell the difference? It's not difficult. How can people continue to not understand what they are looking at when you look at a product page and it says ""Ships from and sold by C4DEALZ?"" Is that Amazon? No, it's not, it's C4DEALZ. When you buy here you will notice that some will say ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"", others will say ""Ships from and sold by *some 3rd party seller*"" and others will say ""Sold by *some 3rd party seller* and Fulfilled by Amazon."" The case with this at the moment is that Amazon apparently has no stock and our thoughtful friends at C4DEALZ see the opportunity to jack up the price by $100 or so and make money off the uninformed, especially in this case because even at that price it's less than buying 3 separate upgrades. Get informed. First clue, outrageous prices gouging the customer (for which Amazon actually should remove the seller as a partner) and you won't see it being available for Free SuperSaver shipping since only Amazon sold or fulfilled items are. In my case I have a gift certificate I'd like to use toward the purchase so I'm rather irritated they don't have stock but I'm not stupid enough to pay C4DEALZ gouging prices, or anyone's for that matter. Now I see that ""The Toy Giant"" has joined the parade of gouging sellers. They should all go on lists of sellers that we will never ever purchase from. Jeff Bezos shouldn't be allowing it, it reflects directly on Amazon."

3017,open-ended,B002MV2MG0,Upgrade from Windows Starter version: Can I use this product to upgrade my netbook from Windows 7 starter version to the full Home version?,,"Yes, go to to the anytime upgrade and run it and use the Key that came with the family pack. With xp you can run it by backing up the system first and then installing it. You need a usb hard drive to back up your doc. pic. and music first. The windows web site will talk you thru it if you have a computer nearby to follow along by the numbers."
3018,open-ended,B002MV2MG0,"XP 32bit to Windows 7 64bit? Just like the topic says, can you upgrade a 32bit installation of Windows XP to a 64 bit installation of Windows 7 using this?",,"Many of the CPUs introduced in the past few years are 64-bit but can run a 32-bit OS, and that's how a lot of computers were shipped before Windows 7 was released -- a 64-bit Intel or AMD CPU and 32-bit Windows. Mainstream CPUs and motherboards made the leap to 64 bits first, with OS, device drivers and applications following only after consumers began asking for the benefits of 64-bit computing. As an example, the machine I'm using to write this shipped with a 64-bit AMD Athlon CPU, 32-bit Windows Home Premium and a paltry 1GB of RAM. I used it that way for awhile before upgrading the RAM and installing 64-bit Windows Vista Ultimate. I understand a few computing devices are still being made with a 64-bit CPU and 32-bit Windows OS. You might find this combination, or instance, in a low-priced netbook that is specifically designed to use only one or two gigabytes of RAM, so there's no benefit to using a 64-bit OS. And you'll find lots of used computers that are built around quite powerful (for the time) 32-bit CPUs; while still more than adequate for almost anything less demanding than image manipulation or gaming, they're forever limited to 32-bit operating systems."

3020,yes/no,B002MV2MG0,"Can I upgrade a bootcamp MAC XP 32-bit, PC with XP 32bit and another with Vista Ultimate 32-bit with this software?",?,"upgrading Vista 32 bit is no problem at all. Upgrading Xp 32 bit can be a nightmare! With xp you have to do a clean install. This means the program wipes out everything on your hard drive and you lose everything. Make sure you back up all your files and data. Once installed you will need all the original disks for whatever software programs you were running on xp or be able to download them from the Internet. You CAN NOT install your software programs from a backup. The next problem that arises is when it asks you for the product key to type in DON'T DO IT!!!!!!! Just hit the enter key and bypass this screen. You can install the product key after windows seven has been install on the computer. Here is why, if you type the product key in when it asks you to and windows has already formated the hard drive you may get a invalid product key message. Now you can't go anywhere in the program. If you start all over again windows doesn't find XP on the hard drive because it has already wipe everything off the hard drive and since this is a upgrade it won't install the program because it can't find XP. Now you are going to spend hours with Microsoft getting the problem corrected. I have installed this 8 times on XP computers and it is not easy and it takes up to about four hours to install on some slow 32 bit machines plus you won't believe how many updates have to be installed. Some computers all night to install them. Don't purchase this program until you run The windows 7 advisor program from Microsoft to see if your computer will run it. Some computers don't have the right requirements to run windows 7. AGAIN FIRST THING TO DO IS RUN THE WINDOWS 7 ADVISOR PROGRAM IT IS EASY TO DOWNLOAD FROM MICROSOFT. Once the software is opened up no one will take it back, EVER! I hope this helps. You may want to look at windows 7 system builder instead of this version."

3023,open-ended,B002MV2MG0,Win7 upgrade family 3 license version: Can I get the Win7 home family pack (3 license) and use my full version install disk instead of upgrading?,,if you don't want to upgrade then you can do the double install. the first install chose a new install and do not enter the key. at the end of this you will be given 30 days to activate. run the disc again and this time chose upgrade and enter the license key. this is a work around issued by ms for people that could not upgrade such as having a 32 bit system and wanting a 64 bit new install

However, as maps of the US do not change too drastically from year to year, I would suggest purchasing last years or even on 2 years old. The cost goes down drastically."

3035,yes/no,B002PRIT0O,Can I save the story files to the cloud rather than to the folder with the application?,?,"You'll want to save it to both. I am saving my story to its folder within the software, and to a flash drive, Carbonite backs up my computer daily, and I save it also to Google Drive so I can easily import my changes to my PC from my laptop. Tip: whenever you close the software it saves the story, so if I open it from the cloud, I always do a save as and save it back to my Writeitnow folder so that I am working within the computer. This is important because then you can Ctrl S and save as you go. When you're done you can save it to the cloud again. Hope that makes sense. Good luck!"

3044,yes/no,B002Q2TTIO,Can I purchase this for my discontinued Garmin (Nuvi 3790T)?,Y,"I would suggest that you contact Garmin technical support and ask that same question to be sure your unit will support it - I have an older model Garmin nuvi and the last update I downloaded required me to put a memory card in to hold the amount of data - it was cheap enough - but something to consider is whether your unit will support current and future map updates & downloads - if your unit will support this lifetime maps update, go for it - great deal"
3045,open-ended,B002Q2TTIO,What is the expected data use for downloading a North American map update?,,"Not quite clear on what you mean. Essentially the update is supposed to give you new info that wasn't included in the previous data, like new streets or some that were previously excluded. One problem I have found is, that when trying to update maps, the system does not allow it, and Garmin will NOT answer when queried about it. VERY disappointing and to my thinking fraudulent (as it prevents me from getting my money's worth.)"

I am a Mac person and a Creative Memories consultant and am excited to say that the Mac version of our software will be out this fall!!! Yipee!! If you can wait just a bit, you can upgrade to Mac version and take advantage of all your Mac can do for you with the creativity the CM has to offer.

3050,open-ended,B002QARRBM,"Parrallels 5.0 vs Boot Camp: Any major advantage of using parrallels 5.0 vs. boot camp, which came with my new macbook pro?",,The primary advantage is that you don't need to shut down your Mac and restart in Windows. You can run them both at once. So it depends on your usage patterns. I like to be able to go back and forth constantly between the two operating systems so I use virtualization software (VMWare's Fusion actually) My son mostly likes to play one game in Windows but he has a Mac so he just uses Bootcamp.

3053,open-ended,B002RS8F64,I have one Rental/Investment Property: Is DELUXE good enough or have to get PREMIER? Is the DELUXE version good enough or have to get PREMIER?,,"I've not used delux for this purpose but even the basic product should support the entry of income and deductions for the rental property IF you know how it should be entered. Again, I'm guessing but based on how premeir went through for our rental property it asks a LOT of questions about expenses, etc. so you know what is deductible. So if you know what's what and where it should go it would probably work. You might even go online to turbotax and try out the package, it's free to enter data etc., you just can't view forms until you pay."
3054,open-ended,B002RS8F64,"Need Premier without state: What about those of us in Nevada, Texas, etc with no state income tax?",,You can get TT w/o state at the Intuit site.

Does Premeir include only one or does it include 5 as well?,,"Robert, it looks like I have succeeded in transferring my 2008 online data to the 2009 desktop product. The online help is a little cryptic, but once you have saved a 2009 .tax file (mine actually had updated 2009 data since I was doing some preliminary work online) to your computer, you should choose Open Tax Return from the File menu of the desktop application. It kicks back to the transferring screen, but then it starts to transfer the data. It left me in the transferring screen with the button that look non-applicable, so I just clicked on the Personal Info or Federal Taxes tabs to get into the application. I hope this helps!"
3056,open-ended,B002RS8F0K,Rental Property: Will DELUXE version work or do I have to get PREMIER? Is the DELUXE version good enough or have to get PREMIER?,,"Deluxe has all of the forms you need, but Premier will walk you thru them in more detail and suggest deductions you may have overlooked. I used Premier for years due to rental income, but switched to Deluxe last year without any problems. You might want to get Premier for the first year, then downgrade to Deluxe for future years after you've identified the kinds of expenses that can be deducted from rental income."
3057,open-ended,B002RS8F0K,how to report wash sale in turbotax? Do I need a wash sale calculator? How do I report wash sales in turbotax?,,"Turbotax does not calculate wash sales. You have to calculate it yourself and import it into turbotax using a special format. I had the same issue. After some search I came across this product on download.com. At first glance, the interface does not look too fancy. But the report it generated was fantastic. It matches all my wash sales. What I like most about it is that all the matched wash sales are highlighted which makes the report very easy to read and I can doublecheck it myself. check it out: http://download.cnet.com/iScheduleD-Portfolio-Manager/3000-2047_4-75147579.html BTW, some guy left a review for this product. According to him, he compared the product's result with Gainskeeper and the numbers are all good. This is what he said, ""Pros: If your an active trader, with multiple brokerage accounts or short positions, this is it. Although this product is categorized as a Portfolio Manager, it really is nothing like feature rich Portfolio Manager but thats a great thing at tax time. Cons: Not an extensive set of portfolio tools by any means. But in my mind this con is actually a strong point. Summary: Its tax time and this tool unlike any other I've seen offers the simplest way I've seen to bring multiple brokerage transactions together, with the ability to quickly modify the CSV files ahead of import for those special positions that require manual-cost basis adjustment. Nothing around I've found to do this, and I've looked extensively.I'll be recommending this to any of my friends that are active traders. Other portfolio tools are for bells and whistles. This is for getting your taxes done accurately and in the shortest time possible. Honestly, brokerages themselves provide extensive portfolio mangagement these days, and if not a Quicken like tool might be desired. But there are many basic tax entries that aren't easily manageable in any of these other tools. This product will quickly streamline imports from multiple brokers, generate your washes flawlessly and spit out 1 nice TXF file. The unlimited version is a great deal for the price. Have short positions that require cost-basis adjustment? This product doesn't natively do that, but its the only tool where since your importing CSV files, you simply add the dividends paid type costs right at the CSV level before import. Other tools are good at automatically recognizing corporate actions like stock dividends and splits. But need a manual adjustment for something like a ROC distribution paid. Your out of luck on the other products."""
3058,open-ended,B002RS8F0K,is state return on the CD (not download) version? Will the CD that comes in the box have state return information for all states on it?,,"No, the software CD does not contain the state tax software. Each and every state must be downloaded after the federal tax software has been installed. If one buys TurboTax Federal and State, the first state tax software download is free. If your father does not have an Internet connection, he will not be able to update either the federal or the state software -- and Intuit is constantly updating its software until about late March. If I remember correctly, Intuit will send out CDs with all updates and the specific state(s) required if one calls their customer support line. I strongly suggest that you call Intuit and ask if they still support offline use of their software. TT will print out all forms needed to submit your tax return, whether federal or state, through the mail. The best approach in your situation might be to install the software on a laptop with an Internet connection, and then in late March, after applying all the software updates and downloading the required state(s), lend the laptop to your father for a day. An inexperienced TT user should be able to complete both the federal and state returns in about four hours or less in most cases."
3059,yes/no,B002RS8F0K,"Questions about Turbotax version: If I want to connect to my brokerage websites to retrieve stock trades ect, can I do this using the Deluxe edition?",?,TT Deluxe has all the forms for any stock/mutual fund investments. For most people Deluxe is more than enough. Intuit reccommends Premier version if you have Stock options or Employee Stock Purchase plan. But again I have found out that Deluxe can handle those situations also. Premer has extra interview questions and guidance for stock options or ESPP. I have used Premer for several years. This year I am dowgrading to Deluxe.
3060,open-ended,B002RS8F0K,"One State Prep only? Is it true that in the 2009 version, you can only download and prep one state for free?",,I am curious about this as well. I do not want to have to buy an additional state package if another person in my house needs to file.
3061,open-ended,B002RS8F0K,Software vs. online? What is the difference between TT software and just going to the website and completing taxes there?,,"I was wondering the same thing so I called Intuit. As far as I understand I can purchase the online version of TurboTax Deluxe 2009 Federal w/free e-file for $29.95. I live in Oregon so the online state version is $36.95 and comes w/free e-file for state taxes. Total $66.90 Looking around the web(amazon) and at local store specials the boxed, off the shelf version, ""TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State 2009 + efile"" is around $50.00. What I learned on the call to Intuit is that in this version the state e-filing is an extra cost. I did see another post regarding this fee. So the off the shelf/boxed version ~$50.00 + $19.95 for state e-file capability comes out to be approximately the same cost(+$3.05) as doing it online with online state e-file being ""free."" Total $69.95. Hope this helps. Obviously if you don't need the state version or mail in your state taxes then the boxed version is cheaper."
3062,yes/no,B002RS8F0K,Turbo Tax 2009 is crashing my computer! Is anyone else having this problem?,Y,"Downloaded TT2009 Deluxe yesterday onto my Mac. Got through the federal file just fine, saved it, and started the state download - then, poof! - it was gone! When I go back to the document file it tells me that the file cannot be opened because it was created with an older version of TT. Anyone else had this kind of problem? I know I used the current application, because it named the file for me and uses a "".tax2009"" extension. I'm afraid to start over, because this might be a software issue vs. operator error. Tax time is bad enough without doing them over and over and over again..."
3063,open-ended,B002RS8F0K,Deluxe or Business for very small personal personal business income (childcare)? Do you think Deluxe would be good enough for my needs?,,I have had something similar over the years although not in childcare but pretty much the same amount etc. and have always used DELUXE-works fine for what I needed. Been using TT/Deluxe for over 10 yrs. now. No need to pay the excess $$ for the other versions for such a small amount of income.

3071,open-ended,B002SR4S0Q,"Difference between online and cd version: Can this be done with At Home cd and download versions, or does the Amazon installer only allow installation to one?",,"To my knowledge they are one and the same, just make sure you keep any codes you were given for reinstalls, so they don't charge twice."
3072,open-ended,B002SR4S0Q,Charitable Contributions: Does H&amp;R have a list of common household items and their approximate donated value?,,"For the past few years, Taxcut has come with an extra disk called Deduction Pro. That program helps you calculate your deductions and includes the fair market value for common items. I think it is included with the deluxe and premium editions of H&R."
3073,open-ended,B002SR4S0Q,Saving TaxCut Tax File: Has this changed?,,"Yes it does, as of 2007. Go to menu ""file"", and then save as PDF will come up. It will prompt you to download PDF995 freeware, which I did, then you can both save and send as PDF file."
3074,open-ended,B002SR4S0Q,State Tax eFile: My question to TaxCut is will the 2009 version support the eFiling of the Arizona state return?,,"TaxCut does offer state e-files, but you need to buy the correct version of the software, which costs a little more with state e-filing. Check the package material and then go to the ""update"" section, hunt around in the offered state updates until you find the correct one WITH e-filing. Also be aware that states get updated when they can be, not all at once, so AZ might not be available yet, when others are. Patience is a virtue. Dave S."

I have had nothing but trouble with it and have switched my backup program to Acronis 2013. Acronis is also not the easiest to manage, particularly when a recovery becomes necessary.

3097,yes/no,B002UEKTK0,"can my husband and i use this program on two different computers ,his and mine seperately",Y,"Yes, Fluenz authorizes three activations on three separate computers. If you are using the same computer with two different accounts/logins, the program will ask for a authorization number for each account but only one activation will be used because the Fluenz system recognizes the one computer ID."
3098,open-ended,B002UEKTK0,What is the difference between the Spain and Latin American version?,,"The largest superficial difference is that Spanish Spanish pronounces the soft ""c"" sound (pronounced ""see"") like ""th"". For example ""conoce"" (you know) is pronounced ""konosay"" by Mexicans and ""konothay"" by Spanish. However the deep difference is the structure of the language. You could say the Mexican Spanish is ""street"" Spanish whilst Spanish Spanish is ""classroom"" spanish. If you speak Spanish Spanish where I live in Texas the Mexicans will laugh at you, sort of like, ""hey, listen to the professor!"". If you're going to Spain then learn Spanish Spanish but if you want to talk to Latinos in the USA speak Mexican Spanish."
3099,yes/no,B002UEKTK0,Does the program have a voice response for proper pronunciation on words?,?,"Hi John, There are exercises in which you record yourself and playback to compare to the original. As for voice recognition software, there is not. We don't believe the technology available is at a sophisticated enough level to always give accurate feedback, and when speaking any language there is so much to be considered such as the pitch, the tone, the speed of what is being said, if the speaker has an accent, which syllables or words to stress, etc. We want to avoid telling a user through our course that something is being said correctly or not after being analyzed by the program, when they would likely be understood speaking on the street. Cheers, Fluenz"

3101,open-ended,B002UEKTK0,is this a good product for homeschool foreign language or more directed towards adults?,,"Hi! Thanks for you interest in Fluenz. We have several homeschool students that use our program. We typically recommend our program for ages 12 and up. However, we have many kids younger than this that use our program. The main factor in determining if it is a good fit for your child is their level of reading comprehension. If your child can do the demo, they will have no problem doing the program. You can view our free Spanish demo here: http://fluenz.com/languages/learn-latin-american-spanish/ If we can help further, please email us at: usersupport@fluenz.com Cheers, Fluenz User Support"

3103,open-ended,B002UEKTK0,How long does each level take to get through?,,That totally depends on the student and how much time they devote to it. Fluenz great program.
3104,yes/no,B002UEKTK0,Is this version for Latin American Spanish?,?,"For the most part yes, the teacher is of Cuban descent."
3105,open-ended,B002UEKTK0,A seller on Amazon is selling this for $50 less than market price because the box has been opened. How am I guaranteed it will work?,,"Hi J, If the product is sold directly by Fluenz, then we guarantee that the product will work. However, if it is sold by a 3rd party, such as this case, there is no guarantee that it will work. In fact, many older versions will not work on newer computers. In addition, used copies do not come with any of our online features or support. We highly recommend that you purchase the program either from our site, or Amazon sold by us. If we can help further, please email us at usersupport@fluenz.com. Cheers!"
3106,open-ended,B002UKHJDE,Does anyone know whether or not the sounds in GPO4 are better than the ones supplied in Finale? Are the strings more real sounding? Etc.,,"I cannot answer... I bought this product thinking it would be easy to install and use. Frankly, it was not worth it and I still have not been able to figure it out. There is no manual, and their customer ""non-service"" speaks only computerese. So if you're a geek, go for it. But I cannot and have not been able to get the danged thing to work, and for the money they're charging, there should be a manual on how to use it with ALL music software. I'm an organist and harpsichordist... I shudder at when they will figure out harpsichords have more than 8' registers. Or that there are pedal harpsichords, period strings, brass, or woodwinds. Then there will be more to offer in a program that, from my point of view, is impossible to use. It was a total waste of money for me. Their sounds may be great (I have no idea!)... but it's a program designed by and for computer geeks, not musicians. If you have better luck with it, let me know."

Use Files of Type Drop Down Box and select Any Type(*.*). Click open and file will convert to.sfk and it will show up in Aria Player. Add instruments the usual way.
3109,yes/no,B002UKHJDE,Does this softwear is compitible with Sonar 8 producer,Y,"Yes it is - and it is a great sounding product for the price. You will probably want to tweak the behaviors, but overall you should have little diffculty with it."
3110,open-ended,B002UKHJDE,Does this product work with Logic Pro X? is it 32 bit or 64 bit?,,"Yes, it works with Logic Pro X. Check out www.garritan.com. They have a blog post about working with GPO4 in Logic Pro X. This is both 32-bit and 64-bit."

3113,open-ended,B002UU0VYI,Can you import an existing Pages doc into this and have it reformat everything automatically? I have a large novel and am starting to get bogged down,,"Not knowing what format you wish to import, I can only offer an example from one perspective. My editor requires everything in RTF, so I export it to her that way. When I receive the edits, they are still in RTF, but Storyist simply changes it back automatically. (I don't even have to import it) Storyist seems to support quite some range of formats, so I don't think it should be a problem. Hope I've helped to answer your question."
3114,open-ended,B002UU0VYI,"why wont this ship to my USA default shipping address? ( Nashville, TN )",,"Hi enzolicious, Storyist is fulfilled by Amazon, which means they handle the shipping from their warehouses using their shipping system.

3115,yes/no,B002V8HUUM,Does it identify different cachets on first day covers?,?,"I do not collect FDCs but I've been using EzStamp for several years and I could not manage my collection without using this program!! (And I have used several in the past. EzStamp, for each stamp in its database, allows entry of Grades, FDC, and PNCs. The FDC section allows for multiple cachets that you would enter in spreadsheet form. Fields provided are: FDC #, Description, Day Issued, FDC Maker, Comments, Value, Qty, Net Worth, Buy Date, Buy Price, Sell Date, Sell Price, Net Profit, Image Link, Location. Just from my quick look, it appears that Day Issued is the only supplied entry. I would think the program would be able to handle as many cachets as you would need. Hope this helps Roy"
3116,open-ended,B002V8HUUM,Are stamp prices automatically updated or do I have to redo every year ?,,"They do not automatically update. You need to load an upgrade and it is not free, although the price is fairly reasonable. It is recommended that you do this every other year or so. I agree with Stephen, Marios is fantastic with his customer support, it is second to none. I too highly recommend this software."
3117,open-ended,B002V8HUUM,How many countries are on this Dvd?,,US and it's possessions only.
3118,yes/no,B002V8HUUM,Do you have a version of EZ Stamp that will work on a MAC,?,"Hi Charles, EzStampis a native PC application. But, you can run EzStamp on your MAC. You will need a program called Virtual PC , Parallels, SoftWindows or iEmulator ( www.iemulator.com/ ) which will allow you to run almost any PC application on your MAC. You will also need a copy of WIndows ( XP, Vista or Win 7 ) We currently have over 1200 MAC users running our software in this way with no problems at all. You can download a FREE demo of Ezstamp to try on your MAC before you purchase from our website at http://www.ezstamp.com Another option is a program called Crossover ( at www.codeweavers.com ). It willlet you run many Win applications without actually having Windows. AlbumGen runs with Crossover. Let me know if you have any questions, regards Marios"
3119,yes/no,B002V8HUUM,Will this run on Wkindows 8 ??,Y,"I would contact the company with that question. I know it runs on 7 , xp and vista. Love the product as I stated."
3120,open-ended,B002V8HUUM,Do the fields self-populate or must all information be input manually?,,Great program. Recommend that you keep a Scott's USA Specialized hand when using a great number of stamp look the same but are not. An error can make a $5.00 stamp worth $500.00 or the other way around. Take time to be sure what you are inputting and good luck.

3124,open-ended,B002V8HUUM,Does the program come with a printed manual or do you have to go to the help screen for explanations.,,"An extensive help system is integrated into the screens and a large .pdf manual is available from the Help menu. You can also get a demo here http://www.ezstamp.com/ezstamp/ezdemoarea.htm. The developer provides dozens of short videos to teach various techniques for features of the program. The help system has been developed over a couple of decades, so if you need help it is there. The developer also responds quickly to email questions and provides a link for that. A vast and well developed program covering most of the world."
3125,open-ended,B002VPE3FU,I have one Rental/Investment Property: Is DELUXE good enough or have to get PREMIER? Is the DELUXE version good enough or have to get PREMIER?,,"I've not used delux for this purpose but even the basic product should support the entry of income and deductions for the rental property IF you know how it should be entered. Again, I'm guessing but based on how premeir went through for our rental property it asks a LOT of questions about expenses, etc. so you know what is deductible. So if you know what's what and where it should go it would probably work. You might even go online to turbotax and try out the package, it's free to enter data etc., you just can't view forms until you pay."
3126,open-ended,B002VPE3FU,"Need Premier without state: What about those of us in Nevada, Texas, etc with no state income tax?",,You can get TT w/o state at the Intuit site.
3127,open-ended,B002VPE3FU,how many federal efiles included? Does Premeir include only one or does it include 5 as well?,,"Robert, it looks like I have succeeded in transferring my 2008 online data to the 2009 desktop product. The online help is a little cryptic, but once you have saved a 2009 .tax file (mine actually had updated 2009 data since I was doing some preliminary work online) to your computer, you should choose Open Tax Return from the File menu of the desktop application. It kicks back to the transferring screen, but then it starts to transfer the data. It left me in the transferring screen with the button that look non-applicable, so I just clicked on the Personal Info or Federal Taxes tabs to get into the application. I hope this helps!"
3128,open-ended,B002VPE3FK,Rental Property: Will DELUXE version work or do I have to get PREMIER? Is the DELUXE version good enough or have to get PREMIER?,,"Deluxe has all of the forms you need, but Premier will walk you thru them in more detail and suggest deductions you may have overlooked. I used Premier for years due to rental income, but switched to Deluxe last year without any problems. You might want to get Premier for the first year, then downgrade to Deluxe for future years after you've identified the kinds of expenses that can be deducted from rental income."
3129,open-ended,B002VPE3FK,how to report wash sale in turbotax? Do I need a wash sale calculator? How do I report wash sales in turbotax?,,"Turbotax does not calculate wash sales. You have to calculate it yourself and import it into turbotax using a special format. I had the same issue. After some search I came across this product on download.com. At first glance, the interface does not look too fancy. But the report it generated was fantastic. It matches all my wash sales. What I like most about it is that all the matched wash sales are highlighted which makes the report very easy to read and I can doublecheck it myself. check it out: http://download.cnet.com/iScheduleD-Portfolio-Manager/3000-2047_4-75147579.html BTW, some guy left a review for this product. According to him, he compared the product's result with Gainskeeper and the numbers are all good. This is what he said, ""Pros: If your an active trader, with multiple brokerage accounts or short positions, this is it. Although this product is categorized as a Portfolio Manager, it really is nothing like feature rich Portfolio Manager but thats a great thing at tax time. Cons: Not an extensive set of portfolio tools by any means. But in my mind this con is actually a strong point. Summary: Its tax time and this tool unlike any other I've seen offers the simplest way I've seen to bring multiple brokerage transactions together, with the ability to quickly modify the CSV files ahead of import for those special positions that require manual-cost basis adjustment. Nothing around I've found to do this, and I've looked extensively.I'll be recommending this to any of my friends that are active traders. Other portfolio tools are for bells and whistles. This is for getting your taxes done accurately and in the shortest time possible. Honestly, brokerages themselves provide extensive portfolio mangagement these days, and if not a Quicken like tool might be desired. But there are many basic tax entries that aren't easily manageable in any of these other tools. This product will quickly streamline imports from multiple brokers, generate your washes flawlessly and spit out 1 nice TXF file. The unlimited version is a great deal for the price. Have short positions that require cost-basis adjustment? This product doesn't natively do that, but its the only tool where since your importing CSV files, you simply add the dividends paid type costs right at the CSV level before import. Other tools are good at automatically recognizing corporate actions like stock dividends and splits. But need a manual adjustment for something like a ROC distribution paid. Your out of luck on the other products."""
3130,open-ended,B002VPE3FK,is state return on the CD (not download) version? Will the CD that comes in the box have state return information for all states on it?,,"No, the software CD does not contain the state tax software. Each and every state must be downloaded after the federal tax software has been installed. If one buys TurboTax Federal and State, the first state tax software download is free. If your father does not have an Internet connection, he will not be able to update either the federal or the state software -- and Intuit is constantly updating its software until about late March. If I remember correctly, Intuit will send out CDs with all updates and the specific state(s) required if one calls their customer support line. I strongly suggest that you call Intuit and ask if they still support offline use of their software. TT will print out all forms needed to submit your tax return, whether federal or state, through the mail. The best approach in your situation might be to install the software on a laptop with an Internet connection, and then in late March, after applying all the software updates and downloading the required state(s), lend the laptop to your father for a day. An inexperienced TT user should be able to complete both the federal and state returns in about four hours or less in most cases."
3131,yes/no,B002VPE3FK,"Questions about Turbotax version: If I want to connect to my brokerage websites to retrieve stock trades ect, can I do this using the Deluxe edition?",?,TT Deluxe has all the forms for any stock/mutual fund investments. For most people Deluxe is more than enough. Intuit reccommends Premier version if you have Stock options or Employee Stock Purchase plan. But again I have found out that Deluxe can handle those situations also. Premer has extra interview questions and guidance for stock options or ESPP. I have used Premer for several years. This year I am dowgrading to Deluxe.
3132,open-ended,B002VPE3FK,"One State Prep only? Is it true that in the 2009 version, you can only download and prep one state for free?",,I am curious about this as well. I do not want to have to buy an additional state package if another person in my house needs to file.
3133,open-ended,B002VPE3FK,Software vs. online? What is the difference between TT software and just going to the website and completing taxes there?,,"I was wondering the same thing so I called Intuit. As far as I understand I can purchase the online version of TurboTax Deluxe 2009 Federal w/free e-file for $29.95. I live in Oregon so the online state version is $36.95 and comes w/free e-file for state taxes. Total $66.90 Looking around the web(amazon) and at local store specials the boxed, off the shelf version, ""TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State 2009 + efile"" is around $50.00. What I learned on the call to Intuit is that in this version the state e-filing is an extra cost. I did see another post regarding this fee. So the off the shelf/boxed version ~$50.00 + $19.95 for state e-file capability comes out to be approximately the same cost(+$3.05) as doing it online with online state e-file being ""free."" Total $69.95. Hope this helps. Obviously if you don't need the state version or mail in your state taxes then the boxed version is cheaper."
3134,yes/no,B002VPE3FK,Turbo Tax 2009 is crashing my computer! Is anyone else having this problem?,Y,"Downloaded TT2009 Deluxe yesterday onto my Mac. Got through the federal file just fine, saved it, and started the state download - then, poof! - it was gone! When I go back to the document file it tells me that the file cannot be opened because it was created with an older version of TT. Anyone else had this kind of problem? I know I used the current application, because it named the file for me and uses a "".tax2009"" extension. I'm afraid to start over, because this might be a software issue vs. operator error. Tax time is bad enough without doing them over and over and over again..."
3135,open-ended,B002VPE3FK,Deluxe or Business for very small personal personal business income (childcare)? Do you think Deluxe would be good enough for my needs?,,I have had something similar over the years although not in childcare but pretty much the same amount etc. and have always used DELUXE-works fine for what I needed. Been using TT/Deluxe for over 10 yrs. now. No need to pay the excess $$ for the other versions for such a small amount of income.
3136,yes/no,B002VPE3FK,State Efile Charge? Does Turbo Tax Deluxe Fed + State + Efile allow you to Efile State returns without any additonal charge.,?,"http://turbotax.intuit.com/best-tax-software/why-choose-turbotax/start-now-finish-faster.jsp With the CD/Download version (as opposed to the online version), you get up to 5 federal efiles included at no extra cost. State efiles are $19.95 extra per efile."
3137,yes/no,B002VPE3FK,Will I still be able to download the state taxes for 2009 with this program?,?,"If your question is ""can you down load 2009 state using 2015 Turbo Tax"", I don't believe so. I would call customer service at Turbo Tax (Google their number), to get assistance with that."
3138,yes/no,B002X8I27U,Can i buy a sd. Card for europe for my nuvi 40 lm,Y,"Yes, I have a Nuvi 50 and I purchased the Garmin City Navigator Europe NT Alps and Dach. It covered all of Germany, Salzburg, Innsbruck, northern part of Italy, most of northern Switz and the eastern portions of Holland, Belgium. It made the trip much less stressful (and I resided in Germany for 9 years). A suggestion, if you want to take the autobahns and the entrances are closed do to construction, go in and turn off ""highways"" (the Garmin will just keep going in circles back to the same point if you don't). When you find another entrance to the autobahn, turn ""highways"", back ON."
3139,yes/no,B002X8I27U,Does this cover Luxemburg?,Y,"Since you insert the mini card when you arrive in Germany, I really can't tell while trying here in the US just now. It worked great for us from Berlin down to Frankfurt with intermittent detours along the way, including cities in France. I would expect it to work in Luxemburg also. Sorry I can be more definitive"
3140,yes/no,B002X8I27U,Is Tuscany included?,?,Nope
3141,yes/no,B002X8I27U,"Garmin Nuvi750 gives message""can't unlock maps"", how to open?",?,The way the Micro SD / SD cards work is: Once you arrive (outside the US) you install the chip into your Garmin (all of the maps are on the Card and stay on the card they do not load onto your Garmin). Turn on your Garmin: The Garmin may or may not prompt you to choose the country you are in (it will take a few minutes for the Garmin to reboot and access the Garmin Satellite and verify your location. I have never heard of the maps needed to be unlocked? You may have to perform the actions above more than one time to get the chip to load on your garmin (once outside the US)
3142,yes/no,B002X8I27U,Does this work with the Garmin Nuvi 1450?,?,"I do not know about your particular GPS model, but when I bought my City Navigator back in June 2014, I went to Garmin's web site, searched for City Navigator, and when I found this particular model, I saw a list of compatible devices. I looked on this web site: https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/maps/on-the-road-maps/city-navigator-nt/c452-c454-c496-p1.html. Good luck. It would be nice if Amazon had this information, wouldn't it?"
3143,yes/no,B002X8I27U,can I buy a sd. card for Europe for my navi 1490,Y,"Yes you can get an sd card. Garmin European cards come out every 2 years and the 2012 is much more reasonable in price than the 2014. We purchased a 2012 that covered Germany, Austria, and Switzerland."
3144,yes/no,B002X8I27U,does it work for pedestrian view?,Y,"Yes, it worked quite well including finding restaurants and gasoline."
3145,yes/no,B002X8I27U,does garmin city navigator for austria switz etc work in a 265w?,?,"I guess it would - mine is a Nuvi 255w, and I would guess there's not a huge difference between that and the 265w. The card is supposed to work in all Nuvi's."
3146,yes/no,B002X8I27U,Does this product cover as far South as Rome Italy?,N,No. Northern Italy only.
3147,yes/no,B002X8I27U,Will this card give me enhanced coverage above the standard European maps in my Nuvi2559?,N,"Do not know what your Nuvi2559 maps are like, but the City Navigator took me throughout Germany in big cities like Frankfurt to doorstep of addresses in Munich as well as small rural towns. It also worked super throughout Austria including finding small B&Bs in rural towns down small roads. Gave me speed limits and lane info which was very useful at Autobahn exchanges and turnoffs."
3148,open-ended,B002ZF31NQ,I'm reading that it comes with 3 licenses. I have 4 people in my home. Is there a way to get the 4th license?

3150,yes/no,B002ZF31NQ,Would you buy it again?,Y,"Positively, absolutely I would buy it again. It is still my favorite program. I just finished disc 1 out of 5 discs. There is a mountain of lessons on each disc. But I feel more confident about my learning Spanish. I still have Rosetta Stone, but I use Fluenz way more. And I liked it so much I bought a copy for my daughter."
3151,open-ended,B002ZF31NQ,Is this Latin Spanish or Spain Spanish,,"Latin American. There is another version that is labeled 'Spain'. If you are nervous about ordering it, remember that it can be returned but you can also call Fluenz just to make sure you are getting the right one. That said, this is the Latin American version."
3152,yes/no,B002ZF31NQ,Is there also a phone app available for android phones?,Y,"Hi Neil! Thanks for your interest in Fluenz. We understand that Android is a priority and we're working hard on developing the app. Please bear in mind that because Android Apps have to support so many different devices it takes work to get it right. We're aiming to have the Android App out to you before the end of the year and hopefully sooner. If we can help further, please email us at: usersupport@fluenz.com Cheers, Fluenz User Support"
3153,open-ended,B002ZF31NQ,Which tenses does Fluenz Spanish teach? Most of the programs I see don't go beyond the present subjunctive. Does Fluenz teach all or most of the tenses?,,I'm studying disc 2 and they touch on the Preterite Tense. Haven't gotten beyond that.

I have had no troubles with the software. I checked to see if the computer was 64 bit compatible, and it is. Therefore MTD4 should run just fine."

3164,yes/no,B0030MUKI2,Is it working with Windows 8.1??,Y,"Now that I've figured out that I actually do have Windows 8.1, guess the next thing to do is try to make Encore work on it. Nothing really to lose by trying. Just need a LOT of time with nothing to do to prepare for all contingencies and emergencies."
3165,yes/no,B0030MUKI2,"does it read the any PDF music sheets? i have a lots of music sheets and i want a software that could read it, thank u for the help",Y,"Sorry, Mohammed - I am having a bear of a time just trying to get my Encore 5.0.2 to work properly (you have to exit the file and re-enter in order to edit mistakes, as if it forgot what it was doing right while you were working on a very delicate musical passage. It's a very nice program otherwise, but seems to be quite self-contained. A quick perusal of ""Help"" and ""Open File As..."" mentions nothing about PDF. Nor is there a Converter. The last posts I have seen when I Google ""GVOX"" or ""Encore 5.0.2"" are from around 2011. Tell you the truth, there are a lot of questions I would like to ask them."
3166,yes/no,B0030MUKI2,Does it work with Windows Vista?,Y,"Yes, it does. 32 bit"
3167,open-ended,B00310UXQW,"Does Fluenz teach reading &amp; writing? Does Fluenz Mandarin 1+2+3 teach reading and writing Chinese characters, or is it just spoken Mandarin with pinyin?",,Fluenz teaches spoken Mandarin with pinyin.
3168,yes/no,B00310UXQW,Is this recommended for kids (6 years old),?,"I don't have a kid, but this program doesn't seem very kid friendly to me. It requires a lot of spelling, like spelling out the word/phrase/sentence you hear. So, my best answer would be no, but maybe someone with children would know better."
3169,yes/no,B00310UXQW,Can this be installed on 2 computers?,Y,"yes, I have been able to install on a laptop as well as a desktop computer."

3171,open-ended,B00310UXQW,Will the program run on Mac Lion or Mountain Lion?,,I'm running Lion and it works great
3172,open-ended,B00310UXQW,What's good for people with mandarin parents? Can anyone else in a similar situation offer any recommendations on the best software to use to learn Mandarin?,,"Hi! Thank you for your question. I would recommend using the Fluenz program, but complimenting it with the book ""Learn Chinese through Songs and Rhymes"" by Lydia Lin. Fluenz will help you learn real world situations and advance your grammar, while ""Learn Chinese through Songs and Rhymes"" will give you additional supplementary vocabulary. If you need additional resources, we would be glad to help further. Feel free to call or email us at: usersupport@fluenz.com."
3173,open-ended,B00310UXQW,How do I spell out the words in Pinyin? Lesson 1 and 2 allowed English characters but the third did not.,,"Maybe you already know this, but Pinyin is the official phonetic system for transcribing the Mandarin pronunciations of Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet in China, Taiwan and I am not sure if in any other country and/or region. Each character would equivalent to a letter and or more typically to syllable in terms of pronunciation for us westerners. The thing is that mandarin is a language based on tones as you may know by know-such is the case of the Vietnamese as well. To write it properly you have to take into account the tones as they are essential. To write the tones you have to use the keyboard pressing the key that corresponds to each tone/accent looking them up in the software menu. I hope this helps!"
3174,open-ended,B00310UXQW,Is the ONLINE portion a supplement or essential? I see that it's only available for 2 years. What will I be missing at the end of 2 years?,,"Not sure what you mean by the online portion. Also not aware of any time restrictions on it. You might be referring to the forums, where you can discuss problems, questions, etc. and download some extra materials, such as podcasts. Or you might be referring to the web-based version of the program, which is just that, a web-based replica of the program, that's available as a ""go-anywhere"" learning tool. So, a) I don't believe there's anything time limited in the system, online or otherwise. b) Nothing online is essential, and the only supplementary material can be downloaded all at once anyway."
3175,yes/no,B00310UXQW,Do the lessons provide the Chinese characters along with the Pinyin &amp; English words? I think learning some hanzi would be appropriate too.,N,No. It's all Pinyin and English.

That's what I did when my old laptop was going out on me - before it died completely - and installed on my desktop instead. If I would have NOT been able to uninstall it before my laptop died, maybe I would have had to call Microsoft tech support. Then when you first use the program, it asks you to unlock it.

I was looking to make a customized 11X17 calendar which I could fold and staple. I saw no way this program could even come close to fitting my needs.

3218,open-ended,B0035NH3ZY,Norton 360 version 4: What is the difference between the Norton 360 version 4 regular and Premier Edition?,,I wondered about the difference too. I looked on Symantec.com where they have comparison lists of their products.

I've replaced my laptop and desktop once since I got O2007 and the only thing I had to do is call an 800# and an automated system activated it for me without any hassle. It's pretty painless. I'd assume O2010 works the same way. Also had replaced a machine since Win7 was installed and it was the same painless process."
3222,yes/no,B0036Z0NZI,will it work on windows 8?,?,"It does work on Windows 8. I cannot remember the issue at the time, but I did have to call tech support for a fix. Windows 8 was brand new at the time and whatever the problem was, it was a quick fix and I suspect it's already been updated."

If purchasing Office 2010 home&amp;business , how can I convert old files to the new version?",,"Use the ""Save as"" option that allows you selecting the version of the software you wish to use.

3231,open-ended,B0036Z0NZI,Is the license of the Microsoft Office Home and Business (disk) perpetual? If a computer crashes or is replaced by another computer can the license of the crashed/replaced computer be used on a new replacement computer?,,"Yes, it can. I've replaced my laptop and desktop once since I got O2007 and the only thing I had to do is call an 800# and an automated system activated it for me without any hassle. It's pretty painless. I'd assume O2010 works the same way. Also had replaced a machine since Win7 was installed and it was the same painless process."
3232,yes/no,B0036Z0NZI,will it work on windows 8?,?,"It does work on Windows 8. I cannot remember the issue at the time, but I did have to call tech support for a fix. Windows 8 was brand new at the time and whatever the problem was, it was a quick fix and I suspect it's already been updated."
3233,yes/no,B0036Z0NZI,can I install this on 2 desktops?,?,I installed it on a laptop and and a pc. I don't think it makes a difference. You get two installs. Shouldn't be a problem.
3234,open-ended,B0036Z0NZI,"Worked with and have saved many files with MS Office 2003. If purchasing Office 2010 home&amp;business , how can I convert old files to the new version?",,"Use the ""Save as"" option that allows you selecting the version of the software you wish to use. For example, a file previously created using Word 97, can be saved as MS Word 97 type of file. The same applies to Excel files created with previous versions of MS Office. Hope this helps."
3235,yes/no,B0036Z0NZI,Is there any program in this package that will enable you to make an address list and then print labels from it?,?,"In Word there are templates for labels, however, I have never used it."
3236,open-ended,B0036Z0NZI,Is this 32-bit or 64-bit?,,"I do not recall what the software says, but I am using it on my 64 bit PC with no problems."
3237,open-ended,B0036Z0NZI,Is this a full version or an upgrade version of MS Ofc 2010?,,Full Version
3238,open-ended,B0036Z0NZI,Does two PCS mean two desktops or does one have to be a laptop?,,"It means two PCS of any kind. Two desktops, two laptops or any combination thereof. Roland"
3239,yes/no,B0036Z0NZI,did anyone then ~crack the code~ of transferring Outlook 2003 PST files to Outlook 2010 w/o grief and the loss of folders (data) ?,?,I had a similar problem attempting to transfer the outlook 2010 for PC to outlook 2011 for MAC. I have the CSV file on my desktop and am gradually overtime adding names etc to my 2011 outlook.

3242,yes/no,B0036Z0NW6,"I've used MS Office Pro 2007 for years, mostly Word and Publisher . Would the 2010 version be a significant upgrade, especially for those programs?",?,"I am just a casual user of Word and Publisher. The advantage of keeping with the version that you are currently using is that you probably are familiar enough with it that you know how to do what you need to do. Every upgrade has enough changes to the user interface that it is a pain to have to learn how to the same results with the new version. The only time I upgrade is when the people that I interface with upgrade. I upgraded to Publisher 2007 when the printer that I work with upgraded and no longer supported my previous version. So my advice is to not upgrade unless you have a specific reason to do so. With a new computer I always go with the latest version just because it usually also has an upgraded operating system and I will be having to learn all over again how to do even simple things anyway. If you are sharing files with others, you may need to upgrade just for compatibility."

You could open Lightroom and say: ""Show me all the photos I keyworded 'Angela' plus 'Fred' plus 'beach,' to help you track down one elusive image you're hunting for. The database component of Lightroom is very much like Apple iTunes, if you're familiar with that. iTunes keeps track of where to find your music files on your hard drive. And just as with music files you have imported into iTunes, when it comes to image files that you have imported into Lightroom, it's very important to move them using the Lightroom application, rather than moving them with Windows Explorer or the Mac OS, whatever you have. Database software stores pointers to tell it where to find a file. If you move a file with your OS instead of within the database program, the database ""pointer is broken"" because the file isn't where it's supposed to be. You are given an opportunity to tell the database program where the file is, but if you can't do that, you can no longer play your music file in iTunes or see your photo file in Lightroom. These programs do have command sequences for Moving an image file or folder to a new catalog location on your hard drive, if you want, and that's always the best way to do it, if you haven't thought far enough ahead to plan out your system for storing image files before you import them. In Lightroom, you can also edit a file in another photo-editing application such as Photoshop. Lightroom will look and see if you have Photoshop installed when Lightroom is installed. With applications it doesn't see, you just right-click the file icon in Lightroom and select Edit In &gt; [browse to the application's .exe file location on your hard drive], and it opens a virtual copy of the image file in that application. When you're done editing there, you save and close the file, and you're returned to Lightroom where you can make additional changes to your virtual copy in Lightroom.

After you install the new version, make sure you update it immediately. Micro-Soft does have an extensive Knowledge Base at their Excel home page. (Your paying a lot for this software, utilize them!)"
3482,yes/no,B0039XZ3PW,What happens if I buy this and it will not let me register to my computer because you already registered it to other computers? Do I get my money back,Y,Yes with the return of the product you can have a full refund.
3483,yes/no,B0039XZ3PW,Is this compatible with windows 8?,?,"Myra, Pretty much. I've used it on 8 and 7. It may be a little more stable on 7, but I don't remember having any major issues on 8. I have not tried it on 8.1."
3484,yes/no,B0039XZ3PW,"Does ""open box"" mean that this serial number has been registered already with Corel?",?,"It can, but does not necessarily. I'm not sure about Corel, but you can buy some ""used"" programs and register them. I've purchased an old ""open box"" Front Page 2003 off ebay had registered it. Haven't had an issue."
3485,open-ended,B0039XZ3PW,need a software to design web pages,,"It can be done in CorelDraw. But if you're interested in ease of use, and a fairly short learning curve, I would recommend buying a copy of Microsoft's Front Page 2003 (full version). This program was dropped by Microsoft in 2003 but is still in use by many, including myself. If you can use Microsoft Word, you will learn Front Page in a very short time. If you use CorelDraw, you must save each page as HTML, and then use an FTP program to upload. Once learned however, it is a powerful way to build a website."
3486,yes/no,B0039XZ3PW,Does this version upgrade from X3?,?,"I think it does, Alan. But because my previous Corel version was older than X3, I didn't quality for the ""upgrade"". So I had to buy the X5 full version."
3487,open-ended,B0039Y59F0,Why are you paying for word processing software and office suites? How do you justify buying standalone office suites in this era?,,WP willl open other formats. WP has Reveal Codes. WP will open all your old WP files. WP is the original great word processing sw. WP doesn't lose your files somewhere online. Etc. You just can't beat it and it's worth paying for. (disclaimer: I'm not a WP employee and Corel doesn't pay me anything~!)
3488,open-ended,B0039Y59F0,I somehow lost the tool box where i can bold-print italicize etc how can I get this back?,,"I will have to agree Mr. or Ms. Harris. You can also put your disk in and let it reboot your WP, or you can also go back to the last time it was on there and select that start up point."
3489,open-ended,B0039Y59F0,I have 3 different computers. Can WordPerfect X5 be downloaded on all 3 computers or do I need to buy 3 disks?,,"Back when I was using WordPerfect and purchased this I had a desktop PC that was connected to the internet and a PC notebook that did not have internet capability. I was able to install WordPerfect X5 on both, but I think it was because the notebook could not register the product. I know that now that I have switched to Apple, most Adobe and Microsoft software for iMac and Macbook Pro allow two computers per software purchase. You might want to check with Corel and see what their policy is with the multiple computer issue."
3490,yes/no,B0039Y59F0,Will this version work with Windows 7 Professional?,Y,Yes I works as advertised. I have been using it on WIN 7 for 2 years.
3491,open-ended,B003B329RA,How many licenses come with this product?,,Two.
3492,open-ended,B003B329RA,"I'd like to load this software to my home computer, an older Mac running OS 10.4. What are the System Requirements?",,"I bought software this via Amazon in summer 2014, and the packaging says, ""System requirements: Multicore Intel processor, Mac OS 10.5.9 or 10.6 (or higher), 1GB of RAM or more, 10.3GB of hard disc space (etc). So I think that this will not run on a mac running 10.4. You could try and upgrade your Mac to a newer operating system though (Mac OS 10.5.9 or 10.6 (or higher)), that might work. In general, we have not found that this software is computer power-intensive, so it may be worth a try if you have a multi-core Intel processor. Good luck!"
3493,yes/no,B003B329RA,"Does this work with Mountain Lion. Just got a new MacBook Pro and persuing a job opportunity that requires I know Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign",?,"Hi Amy, yes it does. You may want to get the new one, CS6"
3494,open-ended,B003B329RA,I have creative cloud on my Mac- will I be able to use this [CS5] on same machine? Will cloud version let me save files to CS5? [OS 10.8.3],,Yes. Yes.
3495,yes/no,B003B329RA,Is this compatible with OSX 10.4 or 10.6?,?,I just recently upgraded to 10.6 and it worked on both versions.
3496,yes/no,B003B329RA,is an open box still able to be registered and licensed?,?,"The CS5 dvd kit I purchased from this seller had not been registered, used or activated by any other party. The registration went forward through Adobe without a hitch at all. And you have the disks, which is better than my previous buy on CS5 which was a download only, oem, and they went offline, so when my harddrive crashed, I couldn't reload. This is permanently yours."
3497,open-ended,B003B329RA,How many computers can I install this on?,,"As far as I can tell, just one."
3498,open-ended,B003B329RA,what exactly is included in the design suite?,,"I uploaded only the programs i needed which were Flash, Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator & Bridge. But it had a lot more design programs that could be useful. i just didn't have the space for them. I love the design suite it does everything i need it to do"
3499,open-ended,B003B329RA,My MAC does not have a CD drive - can this be downloaded?,,Should be possible. You'll need your serial number. The download page is on the Adobe website here: http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/cs5-product-downloads.html
3500,yes/no,B003B329RA,Will this work with 10.9?,?,"Yes, no problems."
3501,open-ended,B003B32B0U,What is the minimum Mac OS required for CS5?,,"The minimum Mac OS required to run Adobe Photoshop CS5 is OS X 10.5.7. A multicore Intel processor is required. The complete list of system requirements is available from Adobe: http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/system-requirements-photoshop.html However - if you have 10.6.8 (minimum) and the cash for the application, I have found CS6 to be a very worthy upgrade."
3502,yes/no,B003B32B0U,Is the Intel Core Duo processor the same as multicore Intel processor,?,I have no idea. Mine is a 3.33 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo. It works fast enough with Photoshop.
3503,yes/no,B003B32B0U,Does Photoshop ever have promotions?,?,"They have been e-mailing these coupons to people over the past couple of weeks (and I believe they still are) who have ""expressed interest in photo editing"" (basically that you've been looking at Photoshop and stuff like it)."
3504,open-ended,B003B32B0U,Does this include Bridge? Does this version of Photoshop also include Bridge?,,"Yes, every version of Photoshop CS5 includes Bridge."
3505,yes/no,B003B329U2,I want to put this on two computers. One at home and one at work. Does this have two licenses?,?,"No. It only has one license, but you can use it on up to two machines, just not at the same time. As long as you close it on one machine you can use it on the other. IOW, if you have it running at home and go to work (and vice versa) without closing it you'll be out of luck."
3506,yes/no,B003B329U2,I just purchased a new laptop with Windows 8. Will this program work with the new Windows 8?,?,Sure. As long as it's a windows version and not a mac version.
3507,open-ended,B003B329U2,How many discs are included? Asking because I think I'm missing one but not sure...,,"It comes with 2 disks, but updates a lot of information from the Internet."
3508,yes/no,B003B329U2,Is this brand new in a sealed box?,Y,The software was in a sealed box and I didn't have any trouble with the installation.
3509,yes/no,B003B329U2,Will this run on Windows 8?,Y,"It worked for me. But was a bit of a pain to get it to work. Had to install a few times... Just make sure you have enough space on your computer to run the programs. And I ran a virus check on my comp before installing, to be safe. But it works beautifully for me now! Couldn't be happier! :) Don't bother asking the Microsoft people at the store to help either. They were useless. She googled my question. (Like I hadn't done that at home first) Idiots."
3510,yes/no,B003B329U2,"I just got a new windows 7 computer, will this software work with that. I read somewhere that there were issues with windows 7",?,"It will work fine with Windows 7 Pro, or Ultimate 64bit..... Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64 processor Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack 3; Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or Enterprise with Service Pack 1 (Service Pack 2 recommended); or Windows 7 1GB of RAM 1GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash-based storage devices) 1024768 display (1280800 recommended) with qualified hardware-accelerated OpenGL graphics card, 16-bit color, and 256MB of VRAM Some GPU-accelerated features require graphics support for Shader Model 3.0 and OpenGL 2.0 DVD-ROM drive QuickTime 7.6.2 software required for multimedia features Broadband Internet connection required for online services"
3511,yes/no,B003B329U2,"can you ship to canada, postal code would be V6K1W4 and i understand the extra freight charges",?,"We can ship to Canada for you, thanks..."
3512,open-ended,B003B329U2,dose it work on win8.1,,"Hi Saad, here is a link to all the system requirements for adobe suites: http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/system-requirements-design-premium.html"
3513,open-ended,B003B329U2,If I buy this product from you am I able to register it with Adobe?,,"Yes, I was able to register adobe suite but t was NOT able register adobe acrobat pro"
3514,yes/no,B003B329U2,does this come with the product key?,?,I don't see why it wouldn't but I'm sure Amazon would make it right if it isn't.
3515,open-ended,B003B32B2S,"You cannot upgrade Photoshop if you own a Suite Edition. Hmmm, I wonder why?",,"When the first series Creative Suite came out, I upgraded from Photoshop to CS1. Great! What I didn't know is, I would never, ever, ever use Illustrator or the other programs. I ONLY used Photoshop. But I've been stuck because as you correctly point out, Wirtzy, you can't upgrade from a suites package back to a single program. My workaround (certainly not an option for many, many Photoshop users), is to swap downward for the latest Photoshop Elements and make much more use of Lightroom (which is an excellent photo editing program). I won't have a CMYK color palette and maybe there will come a day when that's a problem, but I use it so rarely that I just don't care to worry about it."
3516,yes/no,B003B32B2S,"I have PSE 7 installed, can I install this CS5 Upgrade?",?,"Once you go forward, you can't go back. But you should be able upgrade to CS5 from PhotoShop 7. If you are trying to upgrade from PhotoShop Elements to CS5, its not going to work as Elements is a striped down version of PhotoShop. You have to upgrade CS to CS."
3517,open-ended,B003B32B2S,"Has this been uninstalled and deactivated? In other words, is this version clear to be used by new user?",,"I'm sorry are you asking about the PS upgrade that I want to sell? If so, I am not using it, I can't remember if I had it deactivated, but if I haven't I can. Tell me where you found out about me wanting to sell this product?"
3518,open-ended,B003B32B2S,"32 v. 64 bit question: CS2, as it currently is, only recognizes about 2.7GB, so I am just curious that if I upgrade using this, will Photoshop then function as a 64 bit version, and thus be able to recognize more memory, or will it still be considered...",,"It installs in the Win 7 OS directories as both 32-bit (program files (x86) and 64-bit (program files) exe files from my experience. If you've installed Win 7 in 64-bit OS mode (verify in 'control panel-system') and you're using the 64-bit PS exe file, than PS CS5 can use as much RAM as the system can throw at it. http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/404/kb404439.html"
3519,yes/no,B003B32B2I,Is this for the Full Version?,?,It appears to be the full Standard Edition version (not the Extended version) of Adobe CS5. The Extended version also includes tools for working with 3D and motion-based content if you need that. There are also fully functional Academic versions available for less cost but you'll need to prove to Adobe that you qualify in order to activate the product.
3520,open-ended,B003B32B2I,how many licenses with cs5?,,You can activate product on 2 pc's simultaneously.
3521,open-ended,B003B32B2I,How many end users can use one package? Say if my whole family would like to use this on their own computer?,,"The adobe photoshop cs5 terms of an end user license agreement accompanying a particular software file upon installation or download of the software, that means you can transfer the license to an other person..."
3522,yes/no,B003B32B2I,can I use adobe photoshop cs5 on windows 8?,Y,"Yes, you can run adobe photoshop cs5 on windows 8 flawlessly."
3523,open-ended,B003B32B2I,"I currently own PS CS5. I am about to upgrade to a new computer that runs Windows 8. Will PS CS5 work on Windows 8, or will I have to upgrade to CS6?",,You don't need to upgrade if you don't want to. I am running Windows 8 and my CS5 works seamlessly with it.
3524,open-ended,B003B32B2I,Is $259 a good price for Photoshop CS5 ? Is this option even possible with PS?,,"@ A. doeling The main difference between Elements and CS5 (in regard to photos) is that Elements is simpler program for people with simpler needs (i.e. the difference between a hobbyist and a professional). Elements has more buttons that do things is a more ""automatic"" fashion, while CS5 gets more in-depth with the same functions so that a person can fine tune what they need done. In general, if Elements has a tool or function, CS5 has the same tool or function but does it a lot better. But in some cases CS5 has tools that Elements just plain doesn't have, such as layer masks and compositing capabilities (to name a few). If you are looking for a program built more toward hobbyists and scrapbookers, Elements is the way to go. But if you're looking for a professional tool with more advanced capabilities, CS5 is well worth the upgrade."
3525,yes/no,B003B32B2I,Can this version work on window 8?,Y,yes you can.
3526,yes/no,B003BYQ8N0,is there any broblems with nero wave editor,?,"I have not used since had a problem in installation, I try 3 to 4 time and was not able to install completely."

3529,open-ended,B003BYQ8N0,Nero 10 Dell Exclusive: Anybody know if this can only be used with a Dell?,,If you are contemplating Nero software don't waste your time. ConvertXtoDVD works much better. The people at Nero are arrogant and their software is junk. They don't give refunds and expect you to jump through hoops to resolve their crap software problems that you are having. Look elsewhere for software and stay away from Nero.
3530,yes/no,B003D1606G,I currently use Expressions Web 2.0 but it doesn't work in the Google Chrome browser. Does Expression Studio 4 Web Professional address this problem?,?,"I have not seen any issues with the Chrome browser and Studio 4 code. However, the sites I've created do not use any microsoft-specific technology such as asp. If you are creating a site that adheres to html and CSS standards and does not use proprietary technology, then it should work in all browsers. Let me know if you need more info."
3531,yes/no,B003D1606G,does this program have store capabilties??,?,"If by store capabilities you mean can the program store information. No, you store info on computer or flash drive, then program lists what you tell it to. If you mean like a retail store, no. You edit and publish your web pages using Expression Studio 4."
3532,yes/no,B003D1606G,Will it work with windows 8?,Y,"Im using windows 8 pro 64 bit with it now, works final www.iceline.info"

3534,open-ended,B003D24LTI,"Can this product be ""Ghosted"", as in being installed on multiple computers? Or does it require ""Product Key"" you enter on install, which voids others",,I installed it on my desktop computer and my laptop with no problems.
3535,yes/no,B003D24LTI,Will this work with windows 8?,Y,It should work on 64bit Win8 Pro. It's returnable if it doesn't.
3536,yes/no,B003D24LTI,Will this work on Dell's Lattitude D600 Windows XP?,?,Sorry I don't know anything about Dell.
3537,yes/no,B003D24LTI,Will this work on Windows 8?,?,Don't know. It works on 7 and Vista
3538,yes/no,B003D24LTI,Can I use this software on my macbook and if so how?,?,"well i don't think its on apple, all I see is its for Microsoft. But you should see if Leapfrog has anything specific for apple."
3539,open-ended,B003D8XEJA,Differences between CS5 and CS5 Student Edition: Does anyone know what the differences are?,,"What Reid Smith actually asked is ""what's the difference between the $299 academic edition and the $199 student/teacher edition?"" He never got an answer to his question. I posted a lengthy explanation on a review of Photoshop CS4 Student Edition. The review is not available now that CS4 is discontinued, but you can still read it by accessing all of the reviews written by The Irish Patient here on Amazon. It's entitled ""If in doubt, consider the academic edition instead,"" and it was the highest rated review for that product. Briefly, the difference under CS4 was that you didn't have to jump through any hoops to activate the $299 academic edition. The $299 academic edition came with an activation code inside the packaging. You were good to go as long as you could get a third party retailer (like AcademicSuperstore) to send you the academic edition disk. With the $199 student edition, all you got was a disk without an activation code. The code could only be obtained by going through Adobe's verification contractor. You had to open the seal on the software and then send your proof of student or teacher status to Adobe. If you were verified, then you would get an e-mail with the activation code. If you were denied, you had to fight with Amazon to return opened software."
3540,open-ended,B003D8XEJA,"home school: My daughter is home schooled,[following all legal Michigan rules] what are our options regarding our buying this CS5 for her education?",,"I know this is an old question but I thought I'd put up an answer in case it helps others. I am in a home school umbrella organization that is registered with the state of Maryland. After purchasing the student edition, I tried to go through the verification process (many back and forth emails along with one phone call) and was told that my daughter had to be enrolled in a college to receive the student verification code. I ended up returning the Adobe product and then I bought it through UMD using my staff identification. This happened 2 years ago so I don't know if anything has changed. I definitely would think twice before I purchased the student edition."
3541,open-ended,B003D8XEJA,Is a full version of Adobe Bridge CS5 on Adobe Photoshop Extended CS5 Student &amp; Teacher Edition? What does this mean?,,"Personally, I'm using Photoshop Extended CS4 Academic Edition, but you can be very confident that the full version of Bridge is included in CS5 Student Edition. Even if it isn't, you can probably get a copy for free; see below. Mini Bridge is an addition to CS5 products, not a replacement for the full Bridge application. Bridge through CS3 was pretty much useless. Bridge got beefed up in CS4, but many people thought it was cumbersome to have to switch between separate application windows for Photoshop and Bridge. In CS5, users have been given the option to use either full Bridge or Mini Bridge. My understanding is that Mini Bridge operates directly from the Photoshop application window. Adobe has never treated Bridge as an application that anyone would want to have separately from Photoshop. I haven't tried this with CS5, but in CS4 and earlier you could get Bridge for free by downloading the 30 day free trial for Photoshop. Bridge was included in the trial. Photoshop expired at the end of the 30 days, but Bridge remained fully functional indefinitely. I suspect that you could still do this if, for some bizarre reason, the full version of Bridge isn't included in CS5 Student Edition."
3542,yes/no,B003D8XEJA,can i install cs5 on different computers?,?,"You may only use the copy on two computers: ""Can I use Adobe Student and Teacher Edition software on more than one computer? Adobe Student and Teacher Edition software may be used on two computers only. This is ensured through a product activation procedure, which is performed online. "" http://www.adobe.com/education/students/studentteacheredition/faq.html"

3547,open-ended,B003D8XEJA,Adult learning: Does this qulaify for the Student/Teacher edition?,,I would imagine if it were for credit. If it is a continuing ed course not for credit you would probably not qualify. Take it for the credit.
3548,open-ended,B003D8XEJA,"Are non-US students eligible for this software? I'm Russian college student, how can I find if i'm eligible for this software?",,You would need to contact Adobe. Do they have a Russia website?

The next version of MasterCook is due out soon. You might want to check out their website at mastercook.com or ask their tech. support further questions.
3551,yes/no,B003DO96FU,Is it easy to type in my own recipes?,Y,Yes. The program will auto-complete most ingredients as you type. It is even compatible with Dragon Naturally Speaking which makes the process go even faster.

They won't ""select all"" copy and send/export.",,I had the worst time doing just you want to do with Master Cook until I had to make a file of my own and start all over again in WORD.

3556,open-ended,B003DO96FU,I currently am using master cook 4 - would this be compatible to transfer my recipes to?,,"As I recall, there was a significant change in the file format from Mastercook 4 to Mastercook 5. I'm not certain if version 11 can import from version 4. I just took a quick look at the forums and it seems that it will work just fine reading files from as far back as version 2. You just need to open the cookbook file (.MCF) with version 11. There is more detail available at www.mastercook.com, look under ""import and export""."
3557,yes/no,B003DO96FU,does it work in 64 bit windows 8?,?,I'm not sure. It is located in my Program Files ( 86).
3558,open-ended,B003DO96FU,how to convert mc2 and mcx files to pdf,,The only way that I know of would be to use a print-to-PDF from within the Mastercook program.

Also I have Win8 will it be compatible????,,"Many computers will automatically send that alert message. But you may also be getting that message due to incompatibility with your OS. I have used this software for years with no problems using XP and Win7. However, I don't believe this particular version is compatible with Win8. If you go to the manufacturing website you may find the newer Win8 version there, or search for it in Amazon. I am not sure they sell a Win8 package yet though."

Thanks",,Yes I use it for electrical schematics and found to be as good as Autocad for the job.I got a new computer a year ago and found i could not load my Autocad programme 0n it as it was not compatible with Windows 8 so I bought Turbocad . I have made my own symbol library with approx 30 symbols in it which serves me well.I dont seem to be able to find any symbols in the library section.I make control panels and use it for this job.

However, I want to warn you that sometimes Microsoft Works has a ""mind of its own,"" and it will do strange things to you. I have had it move sentences to other paragraphs (on its own) as well as add a letter or two after you finish and save a sentence. If you think you can afford it, I would recommend Microsoft Office Suite instead. Good luck!!"
3580,yes/no,B003E6DF9U,does this work with windows 8,Y,It works on Windows 8 . It installed on a Toshiba Satellite Windows 8 easily and works perfectly. My friend that I bought it for loves it and was so glad to have it as Microsoft Works was what he had used in the past.

Some items I deleted after install.

3602,open-ended,B003FW4O16,I am having trouble finding an exact match of OS X 10.5 for my 2005 iMac PowerPC G5 which is currently running OS X10.4.11.,,Michael I believe you're looking for Tiger and thats kind of hard to find... well hard to find cheap. They are out there however upwards of $100 that I could find. The trouble your going to run into is that the system itself will run ok however when you start using the internet thats when your system slows way down because the newer internet systems require newer pluggins that are not backwards compatible and will cause your older OS to lockup a lot!! And in a lot of cases you will not be able to access your e-mail so the sad news is that it might be time to consider looking for something late 2012 or newer.
3603,open-ended,B003FW4O16,"I have the iMac from early 2008. When i turn it on, the prohibitory sign (circle w/line across) comes on. Can this help fix it? Find hardrive prob?",,"Maybe.

3605,open-ended,B003GAMZFO,Norton 360 version 4: What is the difference between the Norton 360 version 4 regular and Premier Edition?,,I wondered about the difference too. I looked on Symantec.com where they have comparison lists of their products. The only difference between Norton 360 version 4 regular and Premier Edition is that the regular version comes with 2 gigabytes of online storage and the Premier version comes with 25 gigabytes of online storage. You pay a premium price for online storage :)
3606,open-ended,B003GAMZFO,Gift Card: Can you buy software with an amazon gift card?,,"No. I tried tonight and even called customer service. The guy told me to enter a credit card number even though I had money on my gift card, I ended up buying the cd instead."

I am running a MacBook Pro 10.9.2 and it definitely doesn't work on it. It doesn't work with the Mavericks version OS. Also, I have a MacBook which is version 10.7.5 and I AM able to run the Hallmark Card Studio on it. So, it's possible it might work on your MacBook 10.6.8.

Took the programme out and ended up buying a laptop on eBay and putting my cards on that one. If you can do cards on your Mac I don't see why you shouldn't be able to do business cards. Hope this helps, good luck"
3617,yes/no,B003JZNCFS,does this programme stop searched sites from going into your history file?,Y,I can tell that it'll stop a program if it's a bug or virus or if a hacker. I have notice that my history file it's bogged down n it was when I installed this program. I really love it n its made my pc run faster. I just wished I got it sooner. Hope this helps Gina

3631,open-ended,B003KM29N6,How is this item different from the City Navigator Israel Nt Micro SD/SD (ASIN B00AAHS0IM)?,,Its the same! It could be that the higher price one is a version thaats a year newer that may have brand new roads.I would not trust it because there are no buyers for that one. Its probably the same. Stick with the one I got. You will be very happy. Safe trip Jerry Steve A.
3632,open-ended,B003KM29N6,"I have the Garmin n&uuml;vi 2555LMT unit, but no slot or instructions. Please advise me as to how to use this Israel micro/SD card on this unit.",,"The micro chip is a tiny card in a card. It is to the left center of the 1""x1 1/2"" card.

3637,open-ended,B003KT4CRA,Do I need to buy a usb-to-computer interface or it's already included with Guitar pro6?,,It does not come with a usb interface. If you want it to interface with the fretlight guitar (which is what I did) make sure you get the fretlight ready version of guitar pro 6. It costs a little more.
3638,yes/no,B003KT4CRA,"Would this be good for a person who has never played before, who wants to learn to play guitar?",?,"Absolutely! The main reason I got this program in the first place was to play songs by artists that I listened to. That to me is one of the best ways to learn not only playing guitar but what goes into writing a song and music. There are several sites on the internet where people have transcribed popular songs into guitar pro files, that you can download. Then you can read the tablature which is very easy to learn and play the song, and guitar pro can playback the tablature through its internal sounds so you can hear what it should sound like, the tempo, etc. Now guitar pro isn't to teach you how to play necessarily, it will aide you in learning songs or exercises for guitar thought."
3639,yes/no,B003KT4CRA,Is it compatible with Windows 8.0,Y,Yes
3640,yes/no,B003KT4CRA,"I would like to buy the digital download, but on Guitar-Pro.com the price is $59.95. Can I purchase this as a digital download from Amazon?",N,I think you can purchase this one and use the license registration key from your hardcopy to obtain and register the downloadable copy from the official website.
3641,yes/no,B003KT4CRA,Do I need to plug a guitar into the computer to write tabs and chord diagrams? I just want printouts for teaching.,?,"No, you just write the notes in yourself in guitar tab form.

3647,open-ended,B003L51CZ8,Does it still Crash with long AVCHD movies: Does anyone know if this bug has been fixed in Version 10 or if it still exists?,,"THIS works., It's a BIG pain, and Sony really should figure this out but I did it and it worked for me... Home Blogs Rodney Reynolds's blog Fix For Sony Vegas Crashing While Rendering/Editing If you are having issues rendering or editing in Sony Vegas Video Editing software (Pro or Studio), this might resolve the issue until Sony resolves this with a patch. I know it did for me. As a side note, Vegas 9c Pro fixes a lot of compatibility and stability issues. The problem that I had was that when I try using a EVGA X58 + Intel i7 920 Combo and render to the Sony AVC MP4 format it crashes immediately. This didn't happen on my previous X48 computer system. I've tried both Sony Vegas Media Studio 9 and Sony Vegas 8 but both crash on trying to render Sony AVC MP4 format. I've tried just about everything and have the same problem. I've tried reinstalling Vegas, I've tried installing a fresh copy of Vista and then Vegas, I've even tried installing Win7 Beta and Vegas. I've also removed overclock and all default system setting. This fix worked for me on Sony Vegas Studio Pro 9: http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/forums/ShowMessage.asp?ForumID=4&Mes... Here are the details on the fix: ""Most 32 bit exe and dll files have a 2 gig maximum memory cap. I've been playing around with CFF EXPLORER (free download) which is a program that allows you to easily open the exe or dll and click the 2 gig memory switch that allows it to use more than 2 gig. I reset the memory flags in vegas80.exe m2tsplug.dll mcstdh264dec.dll sonymvd2pro_xp.dll to ""greater than 2gig"" and did a render of which I almost always crash on (avchd at 1920 render to m2ts 1920@16Mb/s with AC3 audio) I didn't crash! In fact memory usage shot up higher than i had ever seen vegas use (it shot up to 5gig and leveled off.... usually it climbs no higher than about 3.5 gig and creeps a little) The whole render process of avchd seems to be quite a bit more stable"
3648,open-ended,B003L51CZ8,64bit WIN7? does this work on WIN7 64-bit to?,,Yes it does. I'm using the trial and it works very well.
3649,yes/no,B003L51CZ8,will these dvds play in region 2 UK dvd players?,?,"I'm not sure. I think you can contact Sony Vegas customer support and they should give you an answer. I did try to get a little more information about editing DSLR video on SV but they were no help. In fact, they wanted me to pay for tech support just to get that answer. I've now switched to using Premier and feel it's a way better option. It's costly and you need a great dvd tutorial to get a handle on it but I feel it's 100 times better than Sony Vegas. Good luck with your editing. Sorry I could not give you more info."

I installed sony HD platinum 10 with no problems, and have used it for about a week now without any problems. I haven't tried burning a dvd yet, but so far I have had no problem editing HD video shot with canon and a koday zx3."

If I buy, and find its a junk program withing a day or two may I get a full refund of my money?",,The company's website (www.individualsoftware.com/downloads/typing_instruction/) lets you download a fully functional trial version. A 10 day trial on the one I downloaded.
3656,open-ended,B003LJXELE,Can more than 1 child use it? I have 2 daughters who need it?,,"YES! The program is set up for multiple users, very simple to add them and to sign on individually."

3658,yes/no,B003LJXELE,Is it compatible with Windows 2013?,Y,Yes
3659,yes/no,B003LJXELE,"I wanted to get my son Samsungs Chromobook, will I be able to download this program onto it?",N,No I am pretty sure it is Windows only. The chrome browser supports its own apps though and I believe there are some free typing ones available.
3660,open-ended,B003LJXELE,age group?,,I would say 4 to 8... :)Depending on how much they already know.
3661,yes/no,B003LJXELE,"Does it also teach numbers, punctuation, etc.?",Y,Yes. It does teach numbers and punctuation after the basic a-z keys are learned. This is an awesome program. My boys who are 9 and 10 are typing more than 30 words per minute now.
3662,yes/no,B003LJXELE,Can I use this in the mission school in Nicaragua,Y,"Yes, as long as you have a computer. The instructor speaks Spanish as well as English."
3663,open-ended,B003LJXELE,"When trying to install the instant download, we keep receiving this message: Error 1335.The cabinet file 'Data1.cab' required for this installation is",,Your firewall is probably blocking turn it off n try again
3664,open-ended,B003LJXELE,On how many computers can I install this program? I'll probably want to install it in three different places.,,is you buy the download you can only put it on 1 computer if you buy the CD you can put it on as many as you like .

3666,open-ended,B003LJXEJG,Is this product a direct download from the web site or does it provide a DVD to download the program?,,"It is a direct download. I was able to download it onto three different computers; however, my kids had already began working through their profiles on the family computer and could not transfer their data to their own computers."
3667,yes/no,B003LJXEJG,Does this work with a new Chromebook?,?,"I can't say with 100% certainty since I haven't tried, but based on the way Chrome OS works, I would say no. Chrome is a cloud - based operating system meaning it relies on web-based applications rather than ones installed on the computer. Any storage space on the Chromebook is probably meant to store local media files rather than programs. This program utilizes a Windows - based executable file which would almost certainly not run on Chrome. You will probably have to find a web-based version of this or an alternative, unless you can find a program that will emulate Windows in the Chromebook. There are emulation programs like VMware and Parallels for Mac that would allow you to do this, but I don't know of any similar programs for Chrome at this point. Good luck in any event."
3668,open-ended,B003LJXEJG,why is this not downloading to my computer,,"I was going to say I have no idea, but this is an item you purchase from Amazon. Sometimes you just have to jump through a few dozen hoops with Amazon to get to what you just paid for. I suggest giving them a call."
3669,yes/no,B003LJXEJG,Will this work for Windows XP?,Y,"Yes, it will. I installed our copy around November 2013 on a laptop with Windows XP and there hasn't been any problems with it."
3670,open-ended,B003LJXEJG,How many devices can this be downloaded onto?,,"I only needed it on one devise. In the past I've called Amazon and gotten help with multiple music and book downloads. Contact Amazons Help & customer service department, they can probably help."
3671,yes/no,B003LJXEJG,Will this work with Windows 8???,Y,Yes it does i intalled it on my windows 8 and worked perfectly..
3672,yes/no,B003LJXEJG,does this work on windows 8 touch screen laptop?,?,I'm not sure. I have it downloaded to a PC that has windows 7.

3674,yes/no,B003LX8DVG,does the computer have to be connected to the internet to validate the install?,?,Any window's OS running computer has to be connected to internet for activation of that OS. You have 30 days from the date of installation to activate it. If you do not activate the system will restart in every hour causing lot of inconvenience.

These disks do allow full install of the operating system with all the SP updates required. They normally need to be installed in order. SP1,SP2 then SP3"
3676,yes/no,B003LX8DVG,will this run on asus eeepc 1000hd,?,"Microsoft is about to quit providing any kind of support for Windows XP, including updating drivers and virus protection. I'm not 100% sure of the exact date, but I think it's sometime in April, 2014. While your asus certainly SHOULD have the power to run XP, I am not at all familiar with that machine. If it is a tablet or a netbook of some kind, I would advise you not to mess with it - unless you are VERY savvy when it comes to PC hardware and software installations. Otherwise, you run the risk of damaging your current software installation which may end up making it useless and certainly would void any warrantees you have on your machine."
3677,yes/no,B003LX8DVG,i have xp pro corperate unattended disc and it has gotten cracked. will product key work from it on this one?,N,I'm sorry. That I can not answer. I don't have that disk nor have I heard of it. I only have the oem xp pro and xp home editions.
3678,yes/no,B003LX8DVG,"Will it install with SP3? In otherwords when I install will I need to then install SP1,SP2, SP3. SP1 is no longer supported can't be installed.Thanks",?,"The updates from SP1 and SP2 are already included in SP3, so you don't have to install all of them in order, from the beginning - you can just install SP3 and you're done."
3679,open-ended,B003LX8DVG,Is this a 32 bit or 64 bit version,,"It is 32 bit and unUseable, because the Actvation time is out and or it is a OEM version with no product number. In wich you will be riped of. What is funny the sellers act as if it has value. Typical fraud."
3680,open-ended,B003LX8DVG,"I see the phrase ""Platform: No Operating System "" at the top. What does this mean?",,"Operating system refers to the Windows version you have. If you try to install Windows XP on a new computer, then you will have a very hard time. I don't know if it will let you register your copy, which will cause it to stop working in 30 days, or if you can update it at all. Without updates to XP your screen resolution won't give you a big enough screen to click on buttons in programs (they will be off of your screen and you can't get to them.) I would recommend installing Windows 7 or later."
3681,open-ended,B003LX8DVG,Do you send the Disk or do we down load ??,,"It is, according to Microsoft, a pirated disk and key. Disk comes with burned CD and a paper key with no COA or other validation."
3682,yes/no,B003LX8DVG,Does this have the wifi drivers? Currently have Win 8.1 and hate it...want to downgrade again.,Y,"To whom it may concern asking the question that you say you hate windows 8.1, delete it off your computer..it was design and made to stress out the consumer buyers with to much complexs in order to keep you spending money to the technicians. It's all a mind game set up for the buyers to fall prey to. Istill use windows X/P ... because its so simple. Go with windows X/P or windows vista which is less confusing and easier to operate. My email is tcbmrt22@yahoo.com if you need me further. OK.. have a blessed day stay safe. Mr. Tee!"
3683,yes/no,B003LX8DVG,"I have no OS on my computer, it was built from the ground up without an OS, will this install the windows OS on the computer ?",Y,"It should, provided that the product key is valid. But why would you want to install a unsupported OS onto a new system?"

3689,open-ended,B003MF0L5Y,What version of the Middle East map is this?,,"The current latest version of the micro sd version is 2014.20 as of this writing. Make sure ask for version number from the seller you are going to buy from before purchase, as well as compatibility."

You can set up more than one name for yourself and approach the lessons differently for each name if you want to. Once set up, just cllick on 'lessons' and carry on. It is intuitive and easy to use.

3706,open-ended,B003NVHWO0,I was led to beleive by some of the answers here that this program cam with a cable. But I didn't get one. Was there supposed to be any cables provided? I think my keyboard (also new and still in the box) only has a USB port. What cable would I need?...,,"Hi Julia...no, the software does not come with any type of cables. The answer to what type of cable you need to buy depends on what type of device you're planning on connecting to your keyboard. For example, if you're planning on using a computer - all computers use a rectangular connector (also known as a 'Type B' connector). You need to look at the back of your keyboard and determine what type of connector it requires. It may be rectangular (like your computer) or it may be square (also known as a 'Type A' connector. This will tell you if you need a Type A (because the keyboard has a square connector)/Type B cable (standard rectangular connector), or a Type B/Type B Cable. The Type A/Type B is most common and is nothing more than a standard printer cable. You can find those for around $6. No need to spend any more than that. Hope this helps."

3712,yes/no,B003NVHWO0,Will this work with an iPad and an acoustic piano?,N,"No, it won't run on an iPad. The product description says it supports Windows and Mac only.

The program CD has a Docs folder that has a 293-page Reference Manual in pdf format and a 30-page Getting Started Guide also in pdf format. An internet connection would connect you to detailed online help which is faster but you can also look up such help in the Manual and Guide after you copy the pdf files into your computer from the CD."

3722,open-ended,B003PDMNCC,What Quicken products are compatable with iMac OSX Mountain Lion?,,"The only Quicken product still available at retail for Mountain Lion is Quicken Essentials. I've used Quicken for many years and am sorry to say Essentials is a poor version. They've eliminated features and reports, made other things that took 1 click in older versions take 2-3 in this one. If you can find a used version of Quicken 2008 you may like it better, but they tend to be very expensive."
3723,open-ended,B003PDMNCC,Which version of quicken essentials? Is this Quicken Essentials 1.7.2?,,"It doesn't install as 1.7.2, but after you install it upgrades to the current version."

3725,yes/no,B003PDMNCC,Can I use this to balance my checkbook?,Y,Yes. It can download all of your checking account activity. Where Quicken Essentials falls short is with investment accounts.
3726,open-ended,B003PDMNCC,will it track stock transactions so you will be able to easily know the cost basis of a stock? the PC version does this quite well.,,"I decided to look into this and was able to download my stock data from Charles Schwab.

3728,open-ended,B003PDMNCC,How is it as a retirement planning tool - organizing and projecting categories of expense and income over a period of time?,,"Marty, If you have an Apple computer, I would not advise you to get Quicken Essentials for Mac. I had a Windows computer with Quicken Deluxe before I tried the Apple computer. Quicken Deluxe is a good product but they don't make it for Apple. They have a lame product that they try to pass for Quicken Deluxe but it's worthless as is Essentials. They supposedly have a satisfaction guarantee but they don't stand behind it. So buyer beware! Quicken online customer service is really lame. Again, buyer beware! Quicken Deluxe for Windows is pretty good, however! But if you need customer service or want your money back, forget it."
3729,open-ended,B003PDMNCC,what are the good alternatives to quicken?,,"I recently bought a MacBookPro Retina, and could not the old 2007 version of Quicken, as I have several accounts linked to each other. Fortunately I found on sale at Amazon a newer released version of 2007 Quicken that works very well with Mountain Lion. I strongly recommend it. Previously when this new 2007 version had not been yet available, I had bought Quicken Essentials, and found it almost impossible to use, and wasted my money. I did not try any other programs."
3730,yes/no,B003PDMNCC,is this the most recent Quicken Essentials for Mac,Y,"Yes, it is the most recent for personal use. I was used to the windows version and I was expecting something comparable. I would put the money towards something else."
3731,yes/no,B003PDMNCC,does pc data convert,?,Dont know if you can convert from PC format. I can tell you that the Quicken for Mac version has SIGNIFICANTLY less functionality than the PC version.
3732,open-ended,B003Q81EL2,what is the difference between teacher edition and retal version of lightroom 4?,,"I mis-understood the term "" teacher"" edition. I was thinking it was an edition that would assit you better, or ""teach"" you how to use the product. But you have to register your teaching facility you work at to get the ""teaching"" edition. Then you can share it with multiple computers. I guess i will read the small print better. So i couldnt help much."

3741,open-ended,B003Q81EL2,On how many different computers can it be installed? Can I install Lightroom on all 4??,,No. Per the license rules you can install it on two computers per license and these two can't be used simultaneously. EDIT: Actually didn't realize it was a post about the Student and Teacher Edition. Will try to find out the licensing for this version.
3742,open-ended,B003Q81EL2,Student Version Adobe - can you buy more than one product per student? Does that mean that I can't get her both products?,,"From the Adobe Student & Teacher FAQ page... Q: How many products can I buy? A: You can purchase only one box or download of each education product offered. Based on this, an eligible person can buy 1 copy of the student version for both products."

I'm not sure if they have all been resolved. Go to their website, check the user forums or send them a question. I've sent a few questions in the past and they do respond promptly. I've been cautious about updating the OS as well. Good luck!"

George"
3746,open-ended,B003RDVFOC,Can Finale 2011 do it? or other software to recommend?Thanks.,,"As far as I know, Finale can't do that, but I don't know any other software that does. Maybe some sort of piano educational software?"
3747,yes/no,B003SENTDK,does the program have designs for stand alone garages,?,"The program has a ""Building Wizard"" which has a couple of garage/house configurations, but these only give you the basic outline, as with any other building that you may want to create. All the elements are there for insertion, including a variety of garage doors and roof types. Basically, you can use the wizard or create any building freehand, simply by starting with drawing the walls....then go from there. It takes a little practice and I suggest that you make a hardcopy of the startup manual and run through it a couple of times before trying it from scratch. You can download this from the CAD website. Enjoy."
3748,yes/no,B003SENTDK,Will Floorplan 3D Home and Landscape Pro V15 be able to read AND MODIFIE my old Floorplan Plus 3D version 2 files ?,Y,I have the 3D V9 that didn't convert and I've used TurboCAD 2D since V1.7 that would convert to later 2D versions with a free V1 to V2 program! For 3D drawings that are totally realistic I have and use Chief Architect V-10! As the 2D I get from these 3D drawings isn't any good for fine drawings I switch to TurboCAD v18! While Chief Architect V-10 has the availability of a fine 2D drawing I prefer working in dedicated 2D programs! I originally learned architecture with a drafting board and a slide-rule so once I've found ways that work I use them!

3750,open-ended,B003U2T9EI,I've installed the Southern Africa City Navigator SD card I just purchased into my Garmin Nuvi 265W. But there's no detail in SA. Whats up?,,We had that happen too. I think you must go in the tools or settings and change it to take the infor from the sd card. I believe that's how we fixed. We used in Dec1023-Jan2014 in South Africa and it worked AWESOME!!!!
3751,yes/no,B003U2T9EI,Does this come on a MicroSD card?,Y,"Yes, it comes on a MicroSD card, therefore make sure your Garmin has a MircoSD slot."
3752,yes/no,B003U2T9EI,Does it come in micro card and it works with NU 3490,Y,Yes it comes with the MicroSD card and as long as your device has the MicroSD slot you are ready to go. We used through our extensive 7 week travels through SA and except for new streets that had been added since our departure we fully relied on the maps and enjoyed our travels with ease!
3753,yes/no,B003U2T9EI,"If you own a Garmin with LMT in the model name (indicates free lifetime map updates) and you ad this map, will you have free updates on it as well?",?,"As far as I know, yes. However, before buying a map, check whats on it. I bought S-E Asia, and upon arrival concluded that Laos was not on the map."
3754,open-ended,B003U2T9EI,What would you charge to mail to my adddress in Cnada?,,"The international shipping is calculated by Amazon, but sometimes they charge ridiculously high which is completely unfair, if that happens I will refund your excess shipping fees. The normal cost and insurance should be no more than $10"
3755,yes/no,B003U2T9EI,Would you ship to my Canadian Address,Y,Yes we ship to Canada Thanks
3756,open-ended,B003U2T9EI,Could you please confirm what version the map is? ie 2013.10 or 2013.20 or the latest release 2013.30?,,"The current latest version of the micro sd version is 2014.20 as of this writing. Make sure ask for version number from the seller you are going to buy from before purchase either new or used, as well as compatibility. There are 4 updates for each year version. So 2014.20 is the second update of 2014 map."
3757,open-ended,B003U2T9EI,"please confirm version, also confirm that this is a micro sd , not CD",,I bought this last year: it is a microSD ( see also description further down on the page)
3758,open-ended,B003U3JHGC,Does this come on an installation disc or must it be down-loaded?,,"Mine came on disk, but there was an update available that I downloaded and just used the license number from the retail package"
3759,open-ended,B003U3JHGC,"I know it is 1 user license, but on how many computers can you install this version of the program? I found some that said you can install on up to 3",,"I can't put my hands on my package for this but I researched this question about a year or so ago and my recollection is that you can actually run it legally on a small peer-to-peer network of 3 users. I have used this program for 25 years--including on networks. It is rock solid for what it is. Unfortunately for small time guys like me I think their successor is trying to take it to a higher level to compete with CRM systems which I'm sure it can do. However, they are pricing guys like me out of the market. The bad news is there probably won't be any support for this version going forward. The good news is you probably won't need it. I also wouldn't expect the folks who've sold out to come after you for license infractions but you never know."
3760,yes/no,B003U3JHGC,I used ACT 2000 when it was sold by Symantec. Will your program be able to import my old database from ACT 2000?,?,"I used a version prior to ACT 2000 and it imported my data. The only issue I had was using a none standard directory for my data. It thinks stuff is in the MyDocument directory. I pin my Program file to the task bar, It remembers the files I have opened and there's no problem"
3761,open-ended,B003U3JHGC,How many can connect to a single database? Is there a limit?,,"Purchased this product and could never make it work to my satisfaction, even with one user. I had owned an older version of ACT and had loved it. This one was not user friendly. I wrote a review on this product in 2011 and I stand by that opinion 100%. I have moved on to a more reliable system, and I suggest you do likewise."
3762,open-ended,B003U3JHGC,How many computers can I install this on?,,Just one. It is a single user license that gives you an install code that will only allow one installation.
3763,yes/no,B003U3JHGC,will it work with windows 8,?,"Sorry, don't know for sure. Works on Windows 7 though."
3764,open-ended,B003U3JHGC,I need to print 165 contact reports but this program print out only 5. I tried everything but it is not working. What the heck is wrong ????,,"You need to create a look-up of what contacts you want i.e. city, state, etc. Go to View&gt;Reports&gt;check off on the list what you want and click on Run Reports and look at the preview and select All Contacts."
3765,open-ended,B003U3JHGC,Windows 7: Is Act 2011this windows 7 compatable and is it 32 or 64 bit?,,"Yes, ACT! is compatible with Windows 7 both 32 and 64-bit. But it is only compatible with MS Office 32-bit versions. Lennart zoft80.com"
3766,yes/no,B003U3JHGC,Has anyone installed this program on windows 8.1,N,"NO, using Windows 7 This version does not have the SIDEACT feature. Get a newer version if you like SideAct. In order to get the reminder functionality, you have to start ACT! when you start your computer"
3767,yes/no,B003U3JHGC,Will this work on a 64bit system?,?,I have a Windows 7 Pro 64 bit system and have had no problems with ACT!
3768,yes/no,B003V04V0Q,"Does this program have Gotchas similar to Quicken's 3-year limit where one has to buy their latest joke ""Upgrade"" to keep it working ??",?,"There is an annual fee for support. That includes any upgrades to the software, but it also means you can ask any questions you have by e-mail or by phone, and you will get a prompt and helpful reply. (I see they now have online chat support, but I have never used that.) The cost last time was $45. But this is not ""Gotcha,"" because they are up front about it. If you do not update, the program will still work. (I am still using Quicken Basic 2002, by the way! But only for tracking expenses, not for investments. I will have to buy a new version if and when I need to use Quicken on a 64-bit system.) I have found the annual fee well worth it."
3769,yes/no,B003V04V0Q,Does IAM provide live updates to stock prices within your portfolios?,?,If you subscribe to their QuoteMedia service you can update prices. Check their web site.
3770,open-ended,B003V04V0Q,"It it useful for tracking all assets e.g. real estate, gold, bonds, etc?",,"yes, you can set up a different portfolio for each asset class. Go to their website I'm pretty sure they have a 30 free trial and you can try it out."
3771,open-ended,B003V04V0Q,Does this handle fund class changes where nothing is bought or sold but qty changes,,I haven't had such transactions but that is similar to stock mergers which the program handles easily. You would be exchanging funds rather than stock.
3772,yes/no,B003V04V0Q,Does it work on a Mac?,Y,"From the wesbite: Minimum System Requirements: Pentium Class Processor 1 GB RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit) if Windows 7 machine 2 GB Hard Drive Space Microsoft XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8 Internet Access So it looks like this is Windows only."
3773,yes/no,B003V04V0Q,Can this program work with Canadian investors?,?,I do not see why the citizenship of the investor in publicly traded securities should matter.
3774,yes/no,B003V04V0Q,Does it have an income forecast for stock dividends and interest?,?,"I have no experience with this. IAM can generate an upside-downside report. It seems it can also generate projected earnings and projected growth, but doing that may depend on subscribing to a data-download service. I suggest you simply ask the developers. This is a small company that responds to questions. They are straight shooters and will not con you in any way."
3775,open-ended,B003VNCROU,Can you Install Dragon on More than 1 PC? Will program allow me to do this?,,"When I recently purchased the premium edition of Dragon NaturallySpeaking (version 11 upgraded to 11.5), I was told that the software could be used on a maximum of three different computers by the same individual. I have it installed on two different machines."
3776,open-ended,B003VNCROU,Does Dragon Naturally speaking 11 Premium convert mp3 to text: Does this product actually read the mp3 files or do you have to play it back for it listen?,,"It will work with mp3 files. Select ""TOOLS""; then ""Transcribe Recording"" enter the file name, etc and it will go to work."
3777,yes/no,B003VNCROU,Does Dragon 11 premium work on windows 8 for PC?,Y,yes
3778,open-ended,B003VNCROU,Iphone Remote Microphone for Dragon: Has anyone tried the Dragon Remote Microphone with Dragon Home 11.5?,,The Nuance website lists this feature matrix which shows that Dragon Remote Mircophone (for iPhone) only works with DNS Premium or higher. http://www.nuance.com/ucmprod/groups/dragon/@web-enus/documents/collateral/nc_016429.pdf
3779,open-ended,B003VNCROU,"Does it work for interviews, where two people are speaking? Is this possible?",,"No, there is NO voice recognition software that can do this at all well in 2012. You know how when you call an airline or bank and get into arguments with their voice recognition software that tries to listen to what you need? It's a long-term goal to develop reliable voice transcription that can listen to multiple people with multiple voicings and dialects speaking conversationally, but it's not even close to being implemented yet. Right now, the state of the art for voice recognition, which Dragon employs, is that each user develops his or her own personal user profile that gets more accurate the more it's used. Dragon can only use one user profile per session. The software has to be restarted to load a different user profile for a different speaker, so it's totally impractical in a meeting- or courtroom-type setting where several people may speak a sentence or two in turn. Dragon would do a very poor job in this setting without restarting it to change to a different user profile as the speaker changed--way too many errors to be useful. There is transcription hardware available elsewhere that tries to work around this using Dragon and Word. You need a translator, who re-dictates what he or she hears the meeting or courtroom participants say as they're speaking, much like a foreign translator at the United Nations. This person wears a device that looks like an oxygen mask (to focus the input to Dragon to that user profile, and also to reduce the noise in the meeting or courtroom from having another person speak simultaneously). The people who sell this hardware say that it works well and saves years of practice with a stenography machine such as the ones used by courtroom reporters. I haven't tried it, so I can't say if it's a good workaround, though I do agree that in theory, it sounds workable with a little practice on the part of the re-dictator."
3780,open-ended,B003VNCROU,Trying to convert audio files from my Olympus Recorder to text. Will DNS do this? Will Dragon Naturally Speaking do this?,,"Well I bought an Olympus DM-420 that came bundled with the ""Digital Recorder"" version of Dragon NS 10. (This has been sitting on my desk for a long while because I didn't have the time to do the training previously) I did the voice training and started converting files. Some of the recordings where made while driving and the sound quality is probably below what is reasonable. But even the recordings that were done in quiet areas where my speech is clear and not noisy, DNS generates mostly random words that have nothing to do with what I'm saying in the recording. I'm really disappointed. I'm also glad I haven't invested a lot of time in recording things with the expectation of converting them ""eventually"". The fact it basically doesn't work means the audio files I do have are useless. Even taking the recording I made to do the training and running it through the transcription program generates substantial errors, that are clearly program bugs. About half way through that transcription it stopped using spaces allthewordswereruntogether. Three times now (version 1 and version 10 and one somewhere in between) Dragon's demos and the various good reviews have suckered me into buying their product, at this point I'm giving up. Either there is something about my voice, or their technology doesn't really work."

3786,open-ended,B003VNCRNQ,compare dragon to windows speech recognition,,"I tried Windows Vista speech program and nearly threw my laptop out in the yard! It was SO frustrating, adding words when I would take a breath, trying to predict what I was going to say. Dragon didn't do that. We are still learning each other, but I will say I prefer it to Vista. Hope this helps."
3787,open-ended,B003VNCRNQ,Hands-free editing with Dragon: Is this product a good solution for a writer who has lost the use of her hands?,,"Yes, Pace, it can be used that way. You would have to be patient as you started. You might find it frustrating when you didn't know how to do something or when the program didn't seem to be cooperating. If you can get someone to help you or have another way of operating a browser, check out the videos for Dragon NaturallySpeaking on YouTube to see how it works. To make a correction, I'm looking at your original post. Say you'd stumbled slightly when dictating, and Dragon had transcribed the phrase ""something I'd have to learn elsewhere"" as ""something I'd have to burn elsewhere"". (I doubt it would make that error if you hadn't stumbled when dictating.) Speaking in your microphone, you'd tell Dragon ""Select 'burn.'"" Dragon would highlight the word 'burn.' Since you made a dictation error, you could just repronounce ""learn,"" and Dragon would probably make the correction. If it didn't work, you'd say, ""Correct that."" Dragon would pop down a drop-down menu with about ten alternate words it thinks you might have meant. If you saw ""learn"" as #6, you'd say, ""Choose 6,"" and Dragon would make the correction. If ""learn"" wasn't in the list, you'd say, ""Spell that... l... e... a... r... n..."" [Your spelling would now appear as Choice #1 in the drop-down correction list for ""burn""]. You'd say ""Choose 1,"" and Dragon would make the correction. It would also remember and associate your pronunciation of the word with your spelling, and if it heard it again, it would *usually* not make the same mistake. (Like humans, sometimes Dragon needs repeat corrections of the same error but does eventually get it.) That's also the way you teach Dragon a new word or phrase it's never heard before and can't find in the computer's dictionary. Dragon actually prefers you spell a new or corrected word or phrase aloud than type it in. Dragon isn't trained by typed entry. It has to be spoken aloud (or selected from the Choose Correction drop-down menu) for Dragon to learn. Dragon may come with a few training tutorials, though only enough to get you started; however, there is much more material available online for free on the Nuance website and on other sites as YouTube. Dragon does have a learning curve that I would describe as moderate in difficulty. You need a good headset. The packaged headsets in some Dragon editions are just so-so, and more expensive headsets will perform better with fewer errors needing correction. Dragon gets much better at working with you as you train it and vice versa. If you've ever been to a dog training class, and I don't mean this in any way to be demeaning, as I love dogs, but you realize in a dog training class, the reason that you don't just drop the dog off and come back to pick him up later ""all trained now"" is that in dog training class, you're training the dog, but the dog and the teacher are also training you. So it is with training Dragon. You have to learn it. It does take some practice. Some people get too impatient early on and can't do it. You, Pace, would have a strong motivation to keep at it and would probably do very well with it and find it helpful. In addition to entering text, Dragon 11 can be used to control Word 2003+, browsers, and of course, Dragon itself--by that I mean, you can issue many of the program commands in those programs aloud and they will execute. The premium edition of Dragon 11 can also issue commands in Excel 2003+ without keyboard or mouse. Most other programs, however, cannot be operated by Dragon, so for those you still need some way to input commands such as open file, save, etc. To do this in Word at least, Dragon often also needs at least a computer with a dual- or quad-core processor, and extra memory helps Dragon generally. A ten year old laptop computer or even a new netbook computer may not have enough hardware resources to run Dragon 11 and execute commands in Word well."
3788,open-ended,B003VNCRNQ,this Home version does not work from a pre-recorded audio file: Why don't they offer a version without an inferior recorder included -- ie just the software?,,"Hi Testmaster -- we do offer the Premium Edition without the recorder.

I use it daily, and the approximately $30 price tag makes this version an excellent value for the money. It has a couple of idiosyncracies ( I probably misspelled that....), but I would still recommend it. It has trouble with homonyms, and will capitalize and punctuate on its own sometimes, but for thirty bucks you can't beat it. Good luck!"
3794,open-ended,B003VNCRNQ,does this work with excel: does anyone know if this will work with excel?,,"Dragon 11 can enter data into cells in Excel, yes, as long as she can navigate between the cells and operate the program using mouse or keyboard. If she needs to be able to control the program with Dragon rather than by using a keyboard or mouse, so that she is using Dragon to open the spreadsheet, navigate around the spreadsheet (such as jumping down 12 rows and over one column to select a different cell and make an entry there), save the updated spreadsheet, etc., she needs Excel 2003+, Dragon 11 Premium edition (NOT Home edition, which cannot operate Excel with commands, though Home edition can still enter Dragon-dictated data into the cells), and ideally, a fairly new and powerful laptop or desktop computer with reasonably good resources including extra memory. It will run on an underpowered or old computer, just not as well, and may balk at executing program commands. Even Premium edition Dragon 11 cannot execute dictated commands in most programs other than Word, Excel, PowerPoint, web browsers, and itself-- for that, you still need to be able to use a keyboard and/or mouse. She also needs a good headset. The packaged headsets included with some versions of Dragon are just so-so. Better headsets make fewer errors."

3808,open-ended,B003VUM9XM,Is Print Shop 23 compatibile with Word? Can I open .cph files in Word? I have Windows 7.,,"No, you can only open printshop files in printshop."
3809,yes/no,B003VUM9XM,Can only print 1 page at a time. I am using Windows 7 and only have this problem on Print Shop.,?,"You know, I thought it was just something I did wrong. Example: I will have a one page project that I need 15 copies of and sometimes it will only print one copy no matter how many I put in for it to print and other times I get all the copies I ask for. So now that you say that, I'd have to say it is a glitch. I have Windows 7 also and an old HP Office Jet Printer."
3810,open-ended,B003VUM9XM,How do I delete printing choices from the print wizard?,,I believe you just can delete it. I have never don this kind of thing.
3811,yes/no,B003WT1KAK,does iBank 4 offer Class function? Need to sort Categories for business purposes.,N,"No, unlike Quicken iBank does not have a Class designation. You can do sub categories such as TAXES:Federal, TAXES:State, TAXES:City, etc. You can subcategorize any category."
3812,yes/no,B003WT1KAK,is it good for small businesses,?,I only use it for personal finances. Your best bet would be tobtrybit out. You should be able to down load trial version to test drive to see how it works for you.

They were helpful and polite and after the download all went smoothly and I moved ahead. I think you could download the free trial version and then when you decide it works for you, then just purchase it directly from IGG. Hope this is helpful. I am not a heavy iBank user, but have been pleased with my limited use."
3815,yes/no,B003WT1KAK,"Are competitors orchestrating a malicious campaign to torpedo iBank with dishonest, baseless negative reviews? Sure looks like it.",?,"It looks like it to me, as well. I've used the product for three years. It is not as robust as Quicken in terms of its reporting capabilities, but it's much more stable than Quicken and has an excellent interface. It's not like Quicken is even trying to serve the Mac OS, anyway. I would never switch back."

Although iWeb and iDVD are are again included in the 5-app iLife'11 bundle, I don't think there's been much if any change to these apps since iLife'09.

The reviews of Office 2011 don't look like that version is stable. So, if I buy 2008, I actually have to uninstall Lion and re-install Snow Leopard? Apple's solution was to buy the upgrade of office or reinstall Snow Leopard-which they said was ""very difficult"". This is absolutely unacceptable! When I asked whether it was an oversight or intentional that PowerPC wasn't supported by Lion, I got ""I don't know, I don't have communication with the developers"". Pages won't open office documents either. So...given the choices, I am extraordinarily disappointed with Apple on this one and hope they will come up with a solution, upgrade or patch that works. In the meantime, Try downloading Neo Office for free. It works with Lion even though it is a very basic word processing system. Anybody at Apple listening?"

That being said I take my .doc and .ppt's to church where we use different versions of Office (2003, 2007, 2010) on several different PC's and the Office MAC documents work without issue.

When it is all working correctly, the scanner's name will show up in the import option of the left-most pull down in Elements. When you choose it and the scanner is on, you should get an interface to do the scan and the file turns up directly in the Elements editor when it is done. If there IS a compatibility issue, scans can be made with a number of accessories and freewares.... including my favorite.... Irfanview. Those files can be saved in a JPEG or TIFF format and then easily opened up for editing in Elements."

I use Microsoft Digital Imaging Anniversary Edition 2006 and Picasa which is free and it does everything I want to do and them some. I save everything in jpeg. When saving in Digital imaging I have a choice in which format I want to save a picture in. If your picture is in Elements 9 go to file and save as and you will have a choice of the format.

There seem to be some problems with printing the pdf but I quickly found people who had found ways to work around the issue. Here is the workaround: I have had this issue and found that by changing the Shortcut under the Compatibility Tab, tick Run as Administrator fixed it. Also run the QuickBooks Connection Diagnostic Tool can help as it looks at ports that are not open in the firewall and opens them for you. That said, if you really want to be sure before making the investment, Laura F.

3957,open-ended,B003YJ5ESM,"Starting a new company, shd I purchase QB Pro 2011 for my office accounting: Is QB Pro 2011 the best version to start?",,"Well that depends...First talk to your CPA and see what he/she recommends as you will be sharing info with them and it's good to be on the same page. Second, and this is my opinion, avoid this software unless you can help it because once you use it, you will be stuck with them much the way a gambler would be to the Mafia. Depending on which features you use, you have to upgrade every 3 years or they stop working. Yeah. Also, this is a very basic skeletal accounting software and things like payroll, printing tax forms, or even attaching files to invoices ON YOUR OWN computer requires a monthly or annual subscription service which often times costs many times more than the software. Case in point, enhanced payroll costs over $300 a year on top of the software. Read the high star reviews on here. Then see why Intuit would send so many ""product managers"" to spin greedy marketing practices as ""features"". Read the positive reviews too but you'll notice many of them are suspiciously cut and pastes from the Intuit website. Also notice how many comments have been removed by amazon to censor negative reviews. That should tell you about the character of this company."

I am not able to use the email invoice feature that was integrated into the program since 2009. If you still wish to email your client's invoices to them here's how you can do that: When you have you clients' invoice open and ready to send simply click on the menu item ""File"" and on the drop-down menu select ""Save as PDF."" Save your client's invoice in a named pdf file, for example, ""Client ""S"" April 12 2011.pdf. Once you have done that, click on the ""send"" menu item at the top of the invoice and the ""Email Invoice"" menu item will appear at the top of the drop-down menu. Select ""Email Invoice"" and then the email dialogue window will open. Now open your regular email client where you send all of your business emails from. Switching back to the email dialogue window highlight your client's email address by holding down your left mouse button and dragging it to highlight the whole text. Next, press ""Ctrl and C"" to copy the highlighted email address. Now switch back to your regular email client and in the ""To"" field and press ""Ctrl and V"" to paste your client's email address. Now switch back to the email dialogue window to highlight the main body of text by holding down your left mouse button and dragging it to highlight the whole text which may read something like this for example: ""Dear (Your Client): Your invoice for service date 04. 12. 2011 is attached. Please remit payment at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your business - we appreciate it very much. Sincerely, Your Company 000-000-0000"" Press ""Ctrl and C"" to copy the highlighted main body of text to be entered into your regular email client message body. Now switch to your regular email client to do precisely that. Place your cursor where you want the message to be inserted. Press ""Ctrl and V"" to paste your message into the message body field. Next, click the ""Add Attachment"" button. A dialogue window will appear asking you to open the file to be attached. Look for it in the location you saved it. When it has finally uploaded (it will appear as a paper clip usually attached to your email message.) and you are satisfied with the way your message reads, then press your ""send"" button and your client will receive it in the same format as they did using the integrated email service before the support for that will run out in May. The great thing is you can still send your clients' their bills and estimates and any other document that can be generated for your clients in this way and it does not cost you an extra cent. Sure it is a couple of extra steps, but once you do it on a regular basis, it is a ""walk in the park."" I hope this helps you and answers your question. =}:-)"

3962,open-ended,B003YJ5ESM,Question to 2011 users regarding email: The question is can I still use my bs email (name@companyname.com) with quickbooks 2011?,,"Very simple question: Can we email invoices from QB2008 after 05/31 by any straightforward means. Please, tell us how to do it from the 2008 version. If we have to upgrade to 2011 version and want to email invoices, do we have to subscribe to a service and at what monthly rate?"
3963,yes/no,B003YJ5ESM,do you have to register it?,?,"I do not recall if I registered. I am sure I probably did, however, it helps to register if you want to receive updates."
3964,open-ended,B003YJ5ESM,Making changes on invoices,,"Shirley, Sorry I do not use the invoice feature of QuickBooks."
3965,open-ended,B003YJ5DKG,"Quicken Deluxe vs. Premier: Can someone tell me if this is true, or does the Deluxe 2011 version still allow investment tracking (e.g. providing cost basis and capital gains info)?",,"I just upgraded to Quicken Deluxe 2011. As far as I can tell, 2011 has the exact same ability to track investments as 2008. This includes the Portfolio view, tracking of cost basis and capital gains, portfolio rebalancing, and all the relevant reports. In fact, apart from the user interface facelift, I find myself rather hard-pressed to see any change of significance - positive or negative. I know that there are changes, since the Intuit website brags about them, but they simply don't make much impact on the user experience. A waste of a forced upgrade, but at least it still seems to work."
3966,yes/no,B003YJ5DKG,Does this convert Quicken deluxe 2000 files well?,?,"AFAIK, yes it does. I don't remember which one I updated from, but I had no problem converting. If there is a problem, get an in between one, such as 2005 or 08 - you can probably pick those up very inexpensively."
3967,open-ended,B003YJ5DKG,I've been using version 1994 until now. Which newer version should I buy that will recognize and upgrade this version.,,"I would try advancing the upgrades no more than 5 yrs each time till you get to 2015. 2015 said it could only upgrade files for the past 5 yrs. I had 2007 so I went to 2011 and then was able to upgrade to 2015 so you might want to try 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2015. Or you could try the cheaper way and nstall Quickens in a new location and see if you can start a new file but you probably won't be able to upgrade the old ones."
3968,open-ended,B003YJ5DKG,"How many computers does this support? This says you can download again for re-installation and ""the number of computers may vary"" - does anybody know how many computers you can put this on?",,The EULA says you install on up to 3 computers as long as they are in the same household.
3969,yes/no,B003YJ5DKG,Does this Quicken 2011 work with Windows 7?,?,Yes it does and worked very well BUT quicken will no longer suport downloading from your checking accounts. They forced me to buy 2014 and I hate it.
3970,open-ended,B003YJ5DKG,Which version of Quicken works with Windows 8?,,"I had Quicken 8 and lost my old system. I ended up with windows 8 (or 8.1) and ordered the Quicken Deluxe 2011 with hopes that it would work. It does work quite well. There are a few things that I have had to adjust to and a couple things I can't find but all-in-all, very successful. Hope this helps."
3971,open-ended,B003YJ5DKG,"Suddenly, after more than five years of no problems, Deluxe 2008 crashes my pc when I try to pull up the full listing of scheduled bills. Any fix?",,The program did not crash your pc. You must have had a virus that hit at the same time you were pulling up your list. I hope you had a back up. I suggest you take your computer in to a shop and have them do a system restore.
3972,yes/no,B003YJ5DKG,Does this version work with Windows 8?,N,No.
3973,open-ended,B003YJ5DKG,When Quicken download will expire this Quicken DX 2011?,,"Sorry, I know nothing about Quicken DX 2011."
3974,yes/no,B003YJ5DKG,Can this program be used on Windows 8?,?,"It looks like it can be used with win 8.1 according to a quicken on line chart. However, most reviews and my personal experience would caution using this version. I would suggest you try it on a Windows 8 installation prior to converting an older version or upgrading your OS. Also make sure Intuit is still supporting this version."
3975,open-ended,B003YJ78AE,Which version year of Quicken Deluxe removed the ability to download stock quotes? Anyone happen to know which version of Quicken Deluxe removed it?,,I have Quicken Deluxe 2010 and it downloads stock quotes whenever I run my One Step update.
3976,open-ended,B003YJ78AE,Beta Testers: Quicken 2011 buggy? Should we wait until the first 2011 update? Anyone happen to know which version of Quicken Deluxe removed it?,,"I believe I have found the issue and it has nothing to do with my system but is actually a real bug in the software itself. First I installed on a clean (no third party apps whatsoever) virtual PC running XP, same crash. I was however able to isolate the issue down to a single account (a credit card with one of the big 5 banks), when I created a new quicken file with just this one account it would crash, when I removed this account from my 'main' file it worked fine with the remaining accounts. After thinking about what could be different about this account I remembered I have a very long password (32 characters) on this account; I changed the password to something shorter and now it works. The only reason I went to this effort is, as stated, Quicken is the now unfortunately only game in town - not that I have anything against Intuit but competition is always a good thing for the consumer - and while MS Money wasn't perfect, my track record was only a few (single digit number of) crashes in over 10 years of use - the last version I used (2007) did have one really annoying bug where it miscalculated my mortgage payment so every month I would have to manually correct the number. I really do want to use Quicken, as the spreadsheet alternative isn't worth the effort; I'm just really concerned that they don't invest enough in test and validation - while a boundary condition, a check for this particular bug should have been in any reasonable test plan."
3977,open-ended,B003YJ78AE,How do I copy a single account from a file containing multiple accounts?,,"It depends on exactly what you are trying to do. If you are intending to establish a new file with just the single account with which you are concerned, then probably the best thing to do is to delete all the other accounts except that single account and save the file (as modified) with a NEW NAME. This will result in two files now: the old multiple-account file and the new single-account file. If it was your intention to add the target single account to another FILE already populated with multiple accounts, I am afraid that can only be done for a limited number of account types (not bank, credit card, brokerage, etc.) such as asset or liability accounts. That would be done by exporting the specified account to a QIF file and then importing that new QIF file into the pre-existing Quicken file."
3978,open-ended,B003YJ78AE,Windows 7 CD vs XP/Vista for Download: Why does the CD version of Quicken 2011 say Windows 7 / Vista / XP but the download version says only Vista and XP?,,I would also like to know if the download installation is Windows 7 compatible.
3979,open-ended,B003YJ78AE,"Will there be downloadable versions? Will that be the case for the 2011 versions, too?",,"Would like to know same thing. According to Intuit's website, the downloadble version of Quicken 2011 should be available on Amazon but isn't as of this writing."
3980,open-ended,B003YJ7A3O,"this comes with the software receipt printer and cash drawer, correct?",,"this does come with everything, however if you are planning on keeping inventory this version is a waste of money. It will let you do everything for 90 Days then the trial period is over and if you decide to keep Intuit will ask for $1300 and $30 a month. I still use it as a cash register and keep inventory on excel spread sheet. hope this helps."
3981,yes/no,B003YJ7A3O,I just bought a new computer with windows 8. Does this software work with windows 8?,Y,"Yes, I have a new computer with windows 8 and it works great"
3982,yes/no,B003YJ7A3O,Will this work with Quickbooks Pro 2012?,?,"The software that comes with the Cash Register Plus bundled package is from 2010 and is no longer sold by Intuit. The new software is called Point Of Sale and costs $1,199. The Cash Register Plus software is very basic and is very limited in what it can do. It works fine for simple transactions but most of the sophisticated features are inactive until you upgrade to the Point Of Sale software.

3984,open-ended,B003YJ7A3O,Why is this product still offered when the item is clearly misleading?,,"I am not sure why they mislead you that way. It still did not deter me from my purchase. I had been pricing individual pieces. I even searched online ads, etc... . At one point I almost purchased a used system from a company that had closed. I am very glad I didn't. The equipment I got from Quickbooks was top rate. It had no flaws in construction and, most importantly, it was new. I didn't have to worry that it would malfunction. The software that it came with would work for me in a pinch. I could do basic things with the software and it would work. Ultimately, the flaw, for me, was the amount of information I wished to collect and store. It just wasn't able to keep up with my needs. I chose to purchase another software package that was more in tune with what I was looking for. The real benefit to me was that the equipment from QuickBooks continued to function perfectly with the package I purchased. So ... Misleading. I felt it was. Unusable. Not at all. It was high quality and it still works fine today. I hope this information can be of help to you."
3985,open-ended,B003YJ7A3O,Since this is the free trial version of POS 2010 I am assuming if I purchase the new POS software this will all still work?,,"Yes Catherine, it will... I tried the PRO version because you can do it for free for 30 days, and that is why I noticed that this is not what they offer on Amazon. If you want the PRO version, you have to pay more than $1,000."
3986,open-ended,B003YJ7A3O,how long does the 'FREE' software version last?,,"There is no expiration on the free version of POS 2010, it is not however a full version of the program, but one with basic functions only. You do have to register it in order to keep using it past the trial period. I would imagine that cash register plus would operate the same and if not you can download a free version of POS."
3987,yes/no,B003YJ7A3O,Is this compatible with Quickbooks Point of Sale 2013?,Y,Yes it is. Works great.
3988,open-ended,B003YJ7A3O,"When you say it comes with everything do you mean pc, cash drawer, receipt printer and software?",,You have to supply your own PC. It is in my opionion a little expensive. You have to piece together different aspects of the software to make it all work together.
3989,open-ended,B003YJ7A3O,Does anyone know how many inventory items you can enter into this basic program? We only need it as a basic cash register but have 2500 items.,,"Hi Aasta, The free version that comes with the kit only allows you to set up a very limited number of items.

4000,open-ended,B003YUBS2C,"Do you have to use a stop motion capable camera, or will any video camera work with this software?",,I'm using it with a Panasonic Pv-gs120 MiniDV 3-Chip camcorder on the Firewire mostly. But I have also used it with a Logitech USB webcam. I have also tested it with my JVC HiDef SD Camcorder on USB. It's a pretty flexible software when it comes to camera selection.
4001,yes/no,B003YUBS2C,can this be used with windows 8?,Y,"Yes, after a quick check it seems to. I haven't tried all functionality but the program does open normally and recognize cameras ok."
4002,open-ended,B003YUBS2C,Does it include a blue or green screen or do I need to supply that,,You have to create it yourself.
4003,open-ended,B003YUBS2C,aside from being able to use a green screen how is this different from windows movie maker?,,"It automates putting all the images together nicely, has a dotted clue as to where the previous image was, the little camera is cute and works."

4009,open-ended,B003YUBS2C,"no camera with this, right?",,The camera is included. Kit is really great but you have to look up the manual online (the kit comes only with a quick-start reference sheet).
4010,open-ended,B003YUJBXK,Does it work with MacWord? Does anybody know if that's a problem?,,Make sure you have the 2.5 upgrade. I'm able to use it on Word 2011 and also on Pages and Nisus Writer.
4011,open-ended,B003YUJBXK,Does Mountain Lion Kill Dragon Dictate? What does DD offer that I don't get for free from Mountain Lion?,,"Well, for one, you don't need an Internet connection in order to be able to dictate. It's also somewhat faster, and works a lot better for really long dictation. It depends on what you doing with it. If you're going to be dictating stuff a lot, you will certainly want Dragon Dictate. On the other hand, if you're not doing a whole lot, or it's really just a quick dictation, you might want to stick with mountain lion's built in dictation feature. One of the other options, which I would certainly recommend, when using Dragon Dictate is the use of a better microphone. It really makes a difference. I find it to be extremely accurate on my Mac, and overall quite fast. In fact, I just dictated all of this with it. You should really check Dragon Dictate's website. It contains most of what you're looking for, with all of the different features and everything. One of the best parts is the ability to almost completely control the Mac. This is in comparison with mountain lion only being able to dictate into text fields."
4012,open-ended,B003YUJBXK,"For $150, can I install on both my desktop and laptop computers? What are the licensing terms on this?",,I called Tech support about this very thing and they said that you can install it on 4 (I think it was 4.....either 4 or 5) computers.
4013,yes/no,B003YUJBXK,Will it work with sox (10.9)?,?,"It should, but not as well as windows version. Check software requirements. Mac version crashes a lot. Consider purpose of use. Also buy a really good mic and not one from nuance, Quality of mic matters a lot! It comes with 30 day money back if buying from nuance."
4014,yes/no,B003YUJBXK,Will dragon dictate work without lion?,?,I don't know if this will help you. I had to update my operating system to Snow Leopard 6.0.
4015,open-ended,B003YUJBXK,Standard Version versus Academic Version: Does anyone know if there is a difference between the two?,,"The academic version is the same product. The standard version comes with the serial number in the box whereas you have to prove your academic eligibility to receive the serial number for the academic version. For a college student, this entails identifying your school and uploading a picture of your student ID. For a high school student, you have to submit a letter of correspondence on letterhead paper and get it signed by a staff member. Upon receiving your materials, Nuance will issue your serial number or reject your eligibility claim within two business days. I am a college student who got the academic version. The verification process was pretty hassle-free and was worth the $30 I saved. And in case you are wondering, yes, this message was written with Dragon Dictate."
4016,yes/no,B003YUJBXK,is this program coming for different languages??,?,"I downloaded Dragon app for ipad. and it had spanish, norwegian and a lot of languages."
4017,yes/no,B003YUJBXK,Do i need internet to use it on my laptop.,?,No. It saves your profile changes (voice recognition patterns) to your hard drive. You have to initially load a CD with all the vocabular on it though.
4018,open-ended,B003YUJBXK,i have snow leopard 10.6 --will DD 2.5 work with Final Draft 8.0 ? if i have to update to 10.7 for interface with FD 8.0 it may disrupt pro tools 8,,It should work if you get the one for the older version of Mac.
4019,open-ended,B003YUJBXK,"Hi I wanted to know if this program is used for Spanish- Dragon Dictare, or which I recommend to dictate in Spanish.thanks",,"Hi; At this time Dragon Dictate does not make dictation software in Spanish. In January 2013 look for possible upgrades then. The only thing available at present would be windows dictation scratch Pad, this program does process Spanish-language among others."

If not, what are my options?",,"I'm sure the horrible experience I had with buying Adobe Premiere Elements through Amazon isn't typical, but it was a nightmare, and I would never risk trying to buy it again. Through some unfortunate snafu, I was sold an OEM version of the program which isn't supposed to be sold on its own like regular retail software. It wouldn't work properly, Adobe support tried to help but said the problem stemmed from the fact that it was an illegal copy. Long story short--My brand new computer was scrambled, I had to wipe its memory clean and start over, and Amazon issued me a refund. My strong recommendation is that you buy Power Director from Cyberlink. It costs less than this Adobe program, is fast, easy to use."
4032,yes/no,B003ZTRIW6,Is this age appropriate for an 11 year old girl?,?,"This would be a lot for most 11-year-old girls to master unless they have someone who can teach them. In fact, many adults have this software for months and still cannot master it. There is a kids' version called Flip Boom, that is much cheaper and could maybe be a good starting place. I think you might be able to upgrade from Flip Boom to Studio later on as well...You could check the website to confirm."
4033,open-ended,B003ZTRIW6,"This software can be installed multiple times, right? Like installing it on one computer and then using the same disc on another computer?",,It comes with two discs. One for Mac and one for Windows and I have installed both on my computers but beyond that I don't know.
4034,yes/no,B003ZTRIW6,would it be possible for a 14 yr. old to use this product?,?,"The software is a little quirky, so it's good to download the manual (you can download a pdf off their website) in order to better understand its capabilities. Also, make sure their computer can handle the software. Besides that, I don't see why a 14-year-old would have a problem with this software. You can do a lot with it, but it doesn't make it less intuitive."
4035,open-ended,B003ZTRIW6,so you can use your own images to use for animation,,Yes
4036,yes/no,B003ZTRIW6,would it work on windows 8?,N,I would not know cause I don't have windows 8
4037,yes/no,B003ZTRIW6,would it work on windows 8?,?,Sorry my os is Windows 7. I'm not sure how well it works on 8.
4038,open-ended,B003ZTRIW6,Which version is this? Educational or stand alone? any difference?,,"Stand alone. Includes some great art software, image editing, etc. as well as the animation software."
4039,yes/no,B003ZTRIW6,Can I install this on multiple computer unlimited times activated?,?,I think you can install on two computers. They don't have to be the same platform (we have it installed on a mac and a pc).
4040,yes/no,B003ZTRIW6,Will Toon Boom Studio 6 work with windows-8?,Y,"Yes, I have it installed on a Windows 8 laptop. No problems."
4041,yes/no,B0040FT30O,"Commercial VHS to DVD: Does anyone know if there is any kind of copy protection on the tapes, will this software still work?",?,I have some old VHS tapes from Europe (PAL system) which I want to convert to DVD. Would this software work for such a purpose.
4042,yes/no,B0040FT30O,Is there a way to save the videos to the hard drive rather than DVD?,?,It creates a folder on your hard drive to burn to the DVD. I have been able to play the file from the hard drive.
4043,open-ended,B0040FT30O,Copyright question: Will this allow me to convert my children's copyrighted VHS tapes to DVD?,,"My understanding of copyright law is IF YOU OWN IT you can make a copy for YOUR OWN USE, thereby allowing you to keep the original from being corrupted, damaged, or lost. You may not, however, make copies to share or sell. On the other hand, who's likely to be checking? As long as you're still using those kidvids for your own kids & grands... Makes sense. Just know that if you no longer own the ""originals,"" you might technically be considered to be running afoul of the original copyright exception. NOTE: I am not a lawyer, and my understanding is based on advice rec'd years ago, so you might still want a second opinion."
4044,open-ended,B0040FT30O,Big difference between vhs to dvd 5.0 deluxe and 4.0 plus? Is there a big difference between vhs to dvd 5.0 deluxe and 4.0 plus?,,"4.0 Plus does not support Blu-ray authoring/burning, but 5.0 Deluxe support Blu-ray burning. With 5.0 Deluxe, you can also make copies of the DVD movies that you made previously with VHS to DVD program (not copyrighted DVDs)."
4045,open-ended,B0040FT30O,How do you record more than one home video (that is in vhs form) to a DVD-R disk?,,This you use to digitize the video and you can use a DVD burning software to record multiple movies to one DVD. I think digitizing it is more helpful then put it directly to DVD. I never used the feature of putting it directly on DVD yet because I wanted to pick and chose what I wanted. Also if you want more than one movie on a DVD get larger capacity DVDs.
4046,open-ended,B0040FT30O,Cassette Tapes too? All hardware included? Does this product also convert Cassette Tapes to DVD and is all the hardware needed included in the box?,,"It does convert cassette tapes also.

4048,yes/no,B0040FT30O,Has anyone used this with a Macbook pro?,?,"I have not used it with a mac book, but I checked the install disk and it does have Quicktime which would lead me to believe that it would work with Mac. I hope this helps."
4049,yes/no,B0040FT30O,Does it do video editing before transferring to DVD?,N,No. After installing and registering I was unable to do anything without doing what they claim is a upgrade for a reduced one time only offer of @. 36.00. They said that without this needed upgrade it wouldn't be able to be used. At this point I believed I was being scammed and refused to pay what amounted to extortion. So needless to say it was useless to me after spending considerable amount of time
4050,open-ended,B0040FT30O,Can this product copy copyrighted movies to DVD? I have baskets full of old VHS movies that I would like to convert; does this work?,,"Have you tried it on copyrighted movies? I have a bunch of older exercise tapes that I would like to put on DVDs. Thanks,"

4063,open-ended,B0040GFFGO,Does buying the digital download version give a renewal code? Anyone know for sure?,,"I had the trial version installed on my computer when I purchased the download version. After purchase, Amazon gives you a link to the license key. I just clicked on that and copied it to the version I had installed. Norton updated and showed that I had 366 days left on my software. There is no reason to reinstall anything."
4064,open-ended,B0040GFFGO,Should I use the Norton Removal tool for Norton Antivirus? Bought NIS 2011: Should I use the Norton Removal tool for my currently installed Norton Antivirus 2010?,,"Have you contacted Norton T/S and asked for their recommendation? I have used this tool before and it works very well particularly for removing Registry entries. However, I have only used it based on T/S's recommendations. About three to five years ago there were continmuing problems with Norton's software apps (see Customer Reviews) especially Norton Anti Virus. For me the problems always occurred after Live Up Date ran (at least monthly). When I called T/S their solution was always 1. Uninstall the software using Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel, 2. Run the Norton Removal Tool, 3. Re-Install the software appllication. Starting in 2009 Norton has resolved those problems and my experience has been to just install the new software (the removal tool is not needed). I recently received an e-mail from Norton that provided me with a website that would allow me to update and use NIS 2011 for the remaining subscription time on my NIS 2010. Here is the URL http://updatecenter.Norton.com/manual/AutoDetect While the NIS 2011 installation program was executing I did notice that one of the program steps was ""Uninstalling previous version."" I recently purchased my NIS 2011 from Amazon. When my NIS 2010 subscription expires I'll just enter the product key for NIS 2011 and I'll have a smooth migration. Bill Atlanta GA"

4067,open-ended,B0040GFFGO,Installing Nortons Internet Security 2011: Are there directions on how to do this?,,"It depends on if you have other Norton software or anti-virus software in your computer already. If you have only previous versions of NIS, then the installer should take care of it. If not, you might want to use Norton removal utility to remove traces of earlier Norton software and then install NIS2011."

Here's an article from Wikipedia: Family Tree Maker (FTM) is advertised as ""the #1 selling genealogy software"". As with other genealogy software, FTM allows the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software, which was purchased by Brderbund in 1995. It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership. A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released August 14, 2007. The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claims to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times. A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was finally released November 4, 2010.

But it's anything but a one- or two-click process. In order to do this, one has to prepare the background image, then carefully (and tediously) use the selection tools to outline the subject. Then copy the selection, switch to the background image and then use the ""Paste as Selection"" function to place it on the background. It gets easier with practice. There are several methods to adjust the blend between background and subject. Values for ""Feather"" and ""Smoothing"" and anti-aliasing can be adjusted and the ""Soften"" tool can be used to blend the outline of the placed selection."

About three to five years ago there were continmuing problems with Norton's software apps (see Customer Reviews) especially Norton Anti Virus. For me the problems always occurred after Live Up Date ran (at least monthly). When I called T/S their solution was always 1. Uninstall the software using Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel, 2. Run the Norton Removal Tool, 3. Re-Install the software appllication. Starting in 2009 Norton has resolved those problems and my experience has been to just install the new software (the removal tool is not needed). I recently received an e-mail from Norton that provided me with a website that would allow me to update and use NIS 2011 for the remaining subscription time on my NIS 2010. Here is the URL http://updatecenter.Norton.com/manual/AutoDetect While the NIS 2011 installation program was executing I did notice that one of the program steps was ""Uninstalling previous version."" I recently purchased my NIS 2011 from Amazon. When my NIS 2010 subscription expires I'll just enter the product key for NIS 2011 and I'll have a smooth migration. Bill Atlanta GA"

4116,open-ended,B0043EV5EE,Installing Nortons Internet Security 2011: Are there directions on how to do this?,,"It depends on if you have other Norton software or anti-virus software in your computer already. If you have only previous versions of NIS, then the installer should take care of it. If not, you might want to use Norton removal utility to remove traces of earlier Norton software and then install NIS2011."
4117,open-ended,B0043QIUHM,Does anyone here own the emedia piano and keyboard method deluxe software also? How do the two compare?I'm stuck deciding between them.Any ideas?,,"Getting ready to order this, as I have the emedia stuff (both beginner and advanced) and they just have not kept up with updates and drivers. When the software integration with the hardware worked, it was BRILLIANT, because you can plug in with MIDI, and the program knows when and if you missed a note, and can SHOW you what note you missed (or were delayed or ahead) in playing. Spectacular in theory, but buggy in reality, now, since they have not updated it in a while, and the last time I tried it, it was unusable almost (if you use the tracking bit). If someone would just update it, I think it would be hard to beat. I look forward to trying this Pianoforall as a completely different approach (informal, chord-based, whereas the eMedia stuff is very formal)."
4118,open-ended,B0043QIUHM,Platform? Will this work with Windows 7?,,"Works great with Windows 7! Just be sure you have Adobe Reader and Apple QuickTime installed; PianoForAll relies on those applications for viewing the text, listening to the embedded audio clips, and watching the linked videos."
4119,yes/no,B0043QIUHM,"Compatable with Windows - Which Version? 8, 7, XP, 2000, ME, 98SE, 98, 3.1 etc. Have a very old machine to dedicate.",?,"I have a MAC and iPad which worked on both.

4120,open-ended,B0043QIUHM,Is this product an interactive one? In other words will it show you mistakes as you play and so forth?I apologize if this question has already been asked and answered.,,No. But I found it to be excellent material at a great price. I teach piano and have used Piano for All in my lessons.
4121,open-ended,B0043QIUHM,Is it best to get the cd or download everything?,,"Download everything, but that is not the best piano course out there. There is no music to play, only suggestions, which for a beginner can be confusing, but besides that it COULD BE an excellent way of learning to play the piano."
4122,open-ended,B0043QIUHM,Is this the same program being offered now for $39? Do all the embedded audios play off of the CD-Rom?,,"Hi Elizabeth. This is the same program as on my main website. The download version and the disc are different prices on the website. The books have embedded audio and video. Everything you need is on the disc (which is now a DVD 'data' disc) and needs to be accessed on your computer. The files work perfectly with PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone, or any Android tablet or phone. I hope that helps. Best of luck. Robin Hall"
4123,yes/no,B0043QIUHM,Is it possible to use this ebook to learn to play on a 61-key electric keyboard? I do not have a 88-key piano.,?,"For as much of the course as I've completed, 61 keys are all you need."
4124,yes/no,B0043QIUHM,Can this be downloaded on an IPad 1 ?,?,Hi Mary - I am the author of Pianoforall - the course can be loaded onto 2nd generation ipads (and onwards) using the Free Readdle Documents app (there are full instructions with the disc) It also works with the EZPDF Reader app - but this isn't free. If you can find out if you can install EZPDF Reader then you will be able to use the lessons on your iPad. Hope that helps. Robin
4125,yes/no,B0043QIUHM,"Hi, does this have songs on it that you can learn to play?",Y,"It has been awhile since I bought this - has many songs, but if I remember correctly, they are put out there as chords and you find the melody. This is more playing by chords/pattern than major music reading. I am a piano teacher and have used a number of things from this set in my lessons. It is by FAR the best collection I have found to get playing in a hurry and I highly recommend it."
4126,yes/no,B0043QIUHM,Can someone help me to make the audio and video work on my new Dell laptop with Windows 8.1 please? I have downloaded Apple Quick Time.

4127,open-ended,B0043SK9QU,when you zoom in to work on an image does the brush (or other tool) size also enlarge? does a fine point stay fine?,,"Since the size of the digital art is always expressed in terms of pixels per image and Dots Per Inch (DPI), the tool will always draw on the same number of pixels. So, if the brush is 10 pixels wide, that same brush stroke looks way larger when zoomed in versus way smaller when zoomed out."
4128,yes/no,B0043SK9QU,does it work with a mac?,?,"Platform: Windows Vista / 7 / XP, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion"
4129,open-ended,B0043SK9QU,what is maximum dpi?,,"The highest ""pixels"" per inch you can set your image to be seems to be 460. I don't know how that effects printed output. I don't have a good enough printer to test it, sorry. Hope this helps."

4131,open-ended,B0043SK9QU,Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011: Is Sketchbook pro something that might work for me?,,Heather - I just have this ordered myself and although I've never used it I have drawing friends who swear by it. When Amazon had it at 50% I had to jump at it. It was supposed to be here yesterday so hopefully today but I can post my opinion after I've tried it. I can ay all my art friends love it and we all work professionally. I do illustrations and comic books myself. Bt if I were in your shoes I'd spend the 40.00 for it because I've worked with lot of art programs and for 40.00 for something as powerful as this is supposed o be you just can't go wrong. So I'd take the leap.
4132,open-ended,B0043SK9QU,What is the tablet used in the Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011 video on Amazon?,,"The first tablet was probably a Wacom of some kind, my guess is one of the Intuos professional models. The large tablet monitor you saw was a Wacom Cintiq. Be aware that Cintiqs cost thousands of dollars, and are usually only worth it if you are actively making a living in a field such as concept art, matte painting, etc. You can do everything with a regular tablet that you can with a Cintiq minus draw on the actual screen, so it's really more of a convenience than a necessity. Still, in college I had access to a lab full of Cintiqs 24/7 for four years, and they truly are awesome to use. Maybe if I ever have large amounts of disposable income..."

I use ""stub-check-stub"" business format and get my checks from ASAP Checks, Forms and Supplies ( asapchecks.com) product number BSBM-2500 which is 2500 checks in a box.

4185,open-ended,B0045WAF9U,What kind of printer is needed? Any?,,"The software is for printing checks -either filling in payee, amount etc. on preprinted checks, printing blank checks to be used in other software such as Quick Books, or for doing both at the same time. Likewise with deposits. The software can also manage your check register and deposit register. I use it for printing blank checks and deposits to be used by other software. Having said all that, therefore a printer is needed. It will print to most printers I believe. As for the way we use it, we print via a laser printer with a MICR cartridge to make sure the check account line is encoded the way banks require it to be encoded magnetically."

4205,yes/no,B0046TPO5W,Are you able to write in english and translate into another language.,?,"The problem is with the Text-to-Speach feature, especially useful when you want to learn another language. This software allows translating from English into another language, but you might not be able to hear the pronunciation with some Windows version."
4206,yes/no,B0046TPO5W,Will it work with Window 7 pro 64 bit,?,"The Power Translator installed without problems. It works very well with Windows 7, Pro and Ult. The Power Translator has various modes and I use it frequently for English - Spanish & German. Very good programme."

4211,yes/no,B0046ZLW1G,can use on windows 8,?,"I have been a tech for 17 years own my own successful business worked for the local school district and can assure you that THIS IS ROTTEN TO THE Core. PCmatic will allow your PC to get infected and it's registry corrector is chaos. Use a free antivirus like Avira, or Zone Alarm Free Internet security which uses the kapersky virus engine. Normally about $60. I don't know how they can keep up this charade. It makes techs like me come out and clean up the mess."
4212,yes/no,B0046ZLW1G,Is it better than Norton?,?,"Hi hikingviking, I have Norton on both of my desktop computers but don't use PC Matic's antivirus. I just use PC Matic to clean up the garbage on my computers and update my drivers, fix problems, etc. I am happy with Norton so I have not tried PC Matic's antivirus. PC Matic does speed up both computers, one is 11 years old and my ""new"" one is 8 years old. I hope this helps from a Viking fan in Ohio."
4213,yes/no,B0046ZLW1G,does it provide antivirus protection for XP,?,It seems to filter virus however it has tremendous overhead and during definition download every 12 hours it takes over the machine and can't be put on hold. It process priority is highest so older low RAM XP machine gets totally locked up for up to 45 minutes.
4214,yes/no,B0046ZLW1G,is pcmatic at all connected to the company that does winpatrol ??,?,"Billp studios produces Winpatrol. Many people like it, some don't. It can protect you from registry changes attempted by malware, but it also can pop up and bug you about programs that are legitimate. It is not an anti virus program though. If you really want good protection and utilities that keep things working well. Buy Norton anti virus and Norton Utilities. They are separate programs. I avoid the other Norton products, like their norton 360 etc. as they don't do as good a job and are too complicated."
4215,open-ended,B0046ZLW1G,how do I now if the program is in my computer,,"Their advertising tells the truth. For $50 for five computers for a year, for me was to try it out and it's worth every penny. Remember though, everybody has different types of systems and environments. For me am running Windows 7 with a quad core and Asus motherboard that six years old. I use a good backup system to clone my hard drive just in case, but I've never had to use it. I give it five stars, it's well worth the money"
4216,open-ended,B0046ZLW1G,do you have to purchase pc matic once a year or is it a one time purchase that keeps updating.,,"PC Matic must be renewed each year. The lowest purchase is good for 5 installations, which averages out to about $10 each. If you don't need 5, you could opt to share with family members, having each pay his or her $10 towards the cost."
4217,yes/no,B0046ZLW1G,Does it really work?,?,"I was very frustrated and tried to call them as they advertise they are in this country, speak English....etc. What I was told is they do not offer any phone support at all. They simply do not take calls from customers. They will email you, but if you need to clarify anything, and it is confusing to type, you are out of luck. They refunded my money no questions asked. It did not fix the problem I had when I ordered it, I could not talk to anyone about my issue, so I canceled service."

4221,open-ended,B0047B0U1C,I have windows8 will linux work ok on the laptop?,,"It should work, but there can always be driver issues. Some hardware components are proprietary and may not have full function. But its easy to test. Just go to the ubuntu website download it and run it live off a usb. This way you wont make any permanent changes to your laptop. I normally dont install any linux software on my computer which are all windows and I run linux of a micro usb dongle. so first download ubuntu. Then go to http://www.pendriveapps.com/uui-universal-usb-installer/ and download uui - universal installer Run uui and burn ubuntu onto a usb. Once you burned it onto a usb, you can boot from usb. But make sure your bios is set to let you boot from usb before booting from hard drive. If your bios is set to boot from usb before harddrive your set. Restart your computer and let the linux load from usb. Once loaded you can play around with it and see if anything does not work or if everythingn is fine. I use a micro dongle, with linux install on it. And because its so small I usually dont remove it unless I need to use windows. Because its running from my usb and saves information on the usb it doesnt make any permanent changes to my laptop, but presently i am running windows 7. By the way, go to ubuntu.com to download ubuntu. Dont buy it online since ubuntu is free from the creators."
4222,open-ended,B0047B0U1C,what size usb drive is required to burn ubuntu to the drive?,,4gb or bigger USB drive will suffice nicely. USB drives are cheap so bigger is better!
4223,yes/no,B0047B0U1C,"will linux load on a new hard drive, the old hard drive has been removed",?,It should.
4224,yes/no,B0047B0U1C,"Have old desktop running XP - LinuxLive overwrite not working - if I reformat (to kill XP), will disks load OK?",?,"In my opinion you should treat Linux as a completely new O.S. Do a complete backup of your XP: files, format your HDD, and boot from your DVD I think that you will be running Ubuntu. It is the better of the bunch. Make sure that it is 14.04, not 13.x."
4225,open-ended,B0047B0U1C,"Will Linux run if vista has problems booting? I've tried to restore/repair vista, failed. Will this run on crappy lappy?",,"Yes. That's exactly why I got it. I tried to restore my copy of Vista as well, and it worked ok at first but then went right back to being fussy again. The Linux actually deletes Vista from the drive completely and replaces it with Linux. Stylistically, it looks a little different than Windows, but not much. If you're used to the way Windows looks, it should only take 10 or 15 minutes at most to figure out where to find things in Linux. I think I had to find an e-mail program to use because it doesn't come with one. Thunderbird works well and is easy to figure out."
4226,open-ended,B0047UEXP2,Premium price increase: Why did premium suddenly go from $32 to $57,,"Because Amazon's prices like any retailer are not written in stone. You see a nice deal, get it when you see it."
4227,open-ended,B0047UEXP2,Software vs. online filing?,,I have always used Block (formerly Taxcut). It has always cost less to buy (price wise) and does the job with no hidden klinkers.
4228,open-ended,B0047UEXP2,How much does a state e-file cost? Can someone tell me how much?,,"Well, it depends on the revision you use. If you by the software to install on your computer it's $19.95, if you use the internet verison it is what the chart says... $35"
4229,yes/no,B0047UEXP2,Can't import data from Charles Schwab: Is this correct?,?,"That's correct; you cannot import info directly from Schwab into the H&R Block software. I've used Tax Cut for years (I'm a Schwab customer), and I copy the info I need from Schwab into an Excel file, and then use a third party macro (from InvestoTeK, called ConvertExcel2TXF, $5.00) to make the conversion of the info from Schwab into the needed format (.TXF file) which can be imported. I discovered this last year when doing our 2009 taxes and it works great. You just pay for the macro and download it online. (I have no connection to InvestoTek except as a satisfied customer). FYI if you are a Schwab customer you can buy TurboTax through them for a discount. I just prefer the H&R Block software to TT."
4230,yes/no,B0047UEXP2,Is H&amp;R Block Q&amp;A only or can you go to forms and start? Where I'm going with this is I want to do a return on my own in forms mode and then do one with the interview method and see what gives the best result.,?,"In my experience using H&R B for the last several years, you can manually complete any form. You may, however, run into some issues when the program carries entries from one form to another. You do have the option to override entries, so the manual process should be workable, if not totally painless."
4231,open-ended,B0047UEXP2,schedule c: Does the deluxe version also include the schedule c for self employment?,,"Premium has an advanced Schedule C, but there is a basic one in Deluxe."
4232,open-ended,B0047UEXP2,charitable deductions: Does H &amp; R Block have the same?,,Yes I believe they do.
4233,open-ended,B0047UEXP2,Display cuts off numbers: Has anybody found a way to get around this or is it just an inferior product?,,"I noticed that too as I use large font option, however it is only a display problem in my case, the numbers are there. If you put your cursor on the field and pan you might be able to see the rest of the number. I do in my display."
4234,open-ended,B0047UEXP2,Does 2009 At Home Need To Be Installed To Import? Is this correct?,,"No, but you need your data files on line."
4235,open-ended,B0047UEXP2,Data import? Does this software import tax data from Vanguard or other financial web sites?,,"I know you can import from Turbo, but not sure about websites. I would say a ""99.44%"" yes"

4237,yes/no,B0047UEVAY,will this work with winxp os,Y,"According to the instructions with the disc, it will wipe all Windows OS, including XP. I did two passes on Windows 7 and my HD was wiped clean. The cost is worth it."

4241,yes/no,B0047UEVAY,Will Wipedrive get rid of the trojans/viruses on the computer when it wipes the computer of everything?,?,"I imagine it will since it's going to clean ""everything"" off the hard drive. If you plan to selectively clean identified files, use caution as this is an aggressive cleaner."
4242,yes/no,B0047UEVAY,can you get a downloadable wersion if your cd drive does not work?,N,No
4243,yes/no,B0047UEVAY,Will it work with Windows 8?,?,I was trying to wipe XP off mine to load 8 but never got it to wipe drive clean.

4245,yes/no,B0047UEVAY,can I choose witch parts I want it to wipe? like can I choose just to wipe the recycling bin only. Thanks,N,"No, you cannot. The wipedrive will wipe the hard drive completely."

Can I use this upgrade on my current version?,?,I upgraded from version 9 to this one and it worked however the upgrade to away features I had with 9 like customers adding gratuity on their credit card receipts. When contacting customer service I was told it is no longer part of the basic program and that I would need to upgrade to another program to get that feature back. So I would just be sure the upgrade will enhance not take away from what you are using.

I have Fluenz installed on all 3 of mycomputers. Plus, they have the full program online which you can access from any computer even if not installed. They give you a login for that website when you purchase the program. They are extremely customer focused and responsive if you call or email with questions.

Be careful to read all the reviews about POS 13. We just upgraded from POS 9 and are now opting to return POS 13 and take our chances with no support for POS 9 after 5/31.

4284,open-ended,B004E564PW,Is there a way to search by typing a last name or just the letter of the last name and then have those people's names starting with those letters come up?,,"Hi Jessica, yes I just checked and tried it myself, you can search by the letter of the last name; not only that but by first name only, by address, by phone, by work place, work phone, fax number, email, web sites, city, cell phone, by more than I would have ever thought of. To me in my humble opinion, this is by far the best program EVER!! Truthfully, I still have not discovered everything it can do. I hope you go on their website and see a demo (I believe they have one) and all the fabulous features available. Plus, even better, you can back it up to any device you wish. I have it backed up on a flash drive, in DropBox.com and on an external hard drive. The reason is I have lost so many important things over the years due to computer crashes and my neglect to backup my data, so as you can see, I try to cover all bases and feel no shame that I have 2 to 3 locations for things that are very important to me. Hope this helps you and have a blessed day."
4285,open-ended,B004E564PW,Can I print 100 different address labels with this program? The last program I bought could only do multiple copies of all one label.

Like products purchased in past?,,"You should have plenty of room for that at the ""notes"" section at the bottom of each file. Only the address prints when doing labels. There are many fields that are not included in the ""print labels"". good luck Rob J."
4290,open-ended,B004E564PW,Which fields can it search by? By name only?,,"I use EZ Home & Office in a limited sense, so may not have the definitive answer for this, but every name/address is saved under at least one category such as ""family,"" ""business,"" or any category heading you desire, so the program can also search by category."
4291,open-ended,B004E564PW,Can it print on clear address labels Avery 5160 or 18-660 avery.,,"I don't know since I have not tried it, but I have the paperwork that came with it and you can e-mail them at Support@ElwoodSoftware.com.

4381,open-ended,B004MKBXGY,what does the No Operating System mean with the 2010 version. I'm not computer literate and I'm trying to purchase something that will help out my friend on his sermons?,,"I don't know what they're getting at with that description. The product requires Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. I'm not certain if it's compatible with Windows 8.1 yet or not. This is NOT MAC/Apple compatible. That version is clearly labeled as such."
4382,yes/no,B004MKBXGY,Does this product allow for more than one person to use it. In other words can it be switched from one voice to another without losing anything?,?,Yea it worked for my husband and i
4383,open-ended,B004MKBXGY,what does no operating system mean?,,"I'm not sure, it's very confusing and nonsensical. This is a Windows based version of the program."
4384,yes/no,B004MKBXGY,Does it come with a headset?,Y,"Yes, the headsets vary according to the packaging, but mine was nice with a mic that folds up and is flexible, kinda like a bendable straw, I felt like it was a free gift for what I paid for it."
4385,yes/no,B004MOH5IU,Can you create custom characters?,?,On this no- all pre-fabbed figures. Even Poser 9 is problematic in letting you create custom characters.
4386,open-ended,B004MOH5IU,"Does Poser Debut include a skeleton? I'd like anatomically correct images of skeletons playing drums, and I'm wondering if I can make them with this?",,Yes
4387,open-ended,B004MOH5IU,Where is the serial number location?,,"Two disks are supplied, one for the PC and the other for the Mac. Look at the back of both disk envelopes. I believe the Serial Number is on the back of the Mac envelope. If not, try the other."
4388,yes/no,B004MOH5IU,Are the horses on there too?,Y,"Hi Eleonora, Yes the software includes the horses and some extra animals also it includes cartoons, sceneries, etc. I had lot's of fun using this software and I bet you'll love them to."
4389,open-ended,B004MOH5IU,"I have a MackBook Pro, I though to buy the software and I was thinking on buying a hard disk to make it work. Yes or No? I need something to draw on?",,"Well - if you have a MackBook pro, you should already have a 500GB hard disk - maybe you have a macbook air? I was able to install it and run it successfully on my MacBook Pro. It does take up some space, though, so if you don't already have a hard drive, you'll probably need one."
4390,yes/no,B004NDT6GY,will it work on windows 7?,?,It ran fine when I was using Windows 7. Not so good on Windows 8.
4391,yes/no,B004NDT6GY,Can you use this for Legal Guardian of a minor,?,"All the forms that is needed for anything you need is on this program. If I'm not mistaken, the Legal Guardian forms are included. I use this whenever my boys are away and need to have the forms for someone else to give permission on medical care. I haven't had to use any Legal Guardian, but I believe it is there."
4392,yes/no,B004NDT6GY,Can you use this for Promissory Note Contracts.,?,I have never used this document but it seems to me that it would be fine.
4393,yes/no,B004NDT6GY,Does it contain a Quit Claim Deed,?,"I can't find a quit claim deed, just warranty deed."
4394,yes/no,B004PBG8EC,I want to print a larger scale map to put on my wall. Is this doable?,?,I don't thinks so with this program
4395,yes/no,B004PBG8EC,Will 2011 open maps made with the 2007 Version? The 2013 Version will open back to 2008 Version Maps,N,I haven't tried this. I uninstalled the 2007 version to install the 2011 version. I also did not save any older version maps.
4396,open-ended,B004PBG8EC,Updates? How often does this product get updates?,,"Never, and you cant import older "" est."" files into it. I have lost hundreds of files of addresses when I foolishly bought version 2011 to update my 2005 version. All my old saved data is useless. Also, there are few improvements in the 2011 version except easier access to the (optional, expensive) GPS plug in. This GPS plug in is useless and redundent since most serious drivers have GPS in there autos anyway. I rate Streets and Trips an ""F"". It sucks."
4397,open-ended,B004PBG8EC,"Truck route suggestion? Does anyone know that is this software able to suggest a truck route to avoid the ""no truck roads"", please?",,"Hi Early - No, Streets and Trips will not generate routes based on truck restrictions (No Truck Roads). Many truckers do use the software for planning regardless. There are 'tools' available that will help in planning routes for your big rig...the link below for instance is part of a discussion at LaptopGPSworld.com that talks about the 'POI Mega File' that includes - among other things - a low bridge heights listing. http://www.laptopgpsworld.com/2595-poi-mega-file-pushpin-collections-truckers-rvers-other-travelers#post20736 Of course - as a professional driver, you know you are ultimately responsible for adhering to road signage and staying off 'No Truck' routes....there are Software Packages - such as ALK CoPilot - that generate routes based on truck restrictions...but even these packages can never be 100%. Streets and Trips is a great low cost tool - I suggest trying a post to other truckers at www.laptopgpsworld.com. You'll also find free training at www.mypointsales.com Hope this helped!"
4398,open-ended,B004PIPG2A,My facebook email address has changed. How do I get it changed for corell studio5?,,"To start with it's Corel, not corell and Pro X4, not Studio5. This is a video editing software, not a social media."
4399,open-ended,B004PIPG2A,Editing VCR tapes: Can I use this to import VCR tapes to my computer?,,"Not sure if you're still looking for an answer. But if you still want to know, the answer is ""no"". This is not a tool to transfer or import clips from one format to another. You will have to first convert your VHS movies into digital format before you can use this software for editing."
4400,yes/no,B004PIPG2A,can I use windows 8 with it,Y,I'm using it with win 8.1 and on win 8 prior to that.
4401,yes/no,B004PIPG2A,does this work with Windows 8?,?,I have no idea.. I never bought this.
4402,open-ended,B004PIPG2A,My facebook email address has changed. How do I get it changed for corell studio5?,,"To start with it's Corel, not corell and Pro X4, not Studio5. This is a video editing software, not a social media."

4406,yes/no,B004PYH7X0,"Had 1st Broderbund version. What kind of adventures can you have, i.e., secret tepees, Indian attacks, surprise objects, using your brain, etc.?",?,very good graphics and more exciting than the first edition
4407,open-ended,B004PYH7X0,I bought oregon trial thinking it would work with windows 7 because that is what you said on your ad but I can't get it to work at all,,The copy we got of Oregon Trail did work on Windows 7.
4408,open-ended,B004PYH7X0,I bought this because you said it works with Windows 7 and it does not! Don't they have a game that runs on windows 7?,,I have been using this one for years and it works fine. My grandkids just played it yesterday.
4409,yes/no,B004PYH7X0,"I have windows 7, maybe 64 bit system, will these work with what I have?",?,"I run the game on W7, 64 bit. So yes."
4410,open-ended,B004PYH7X0,why will it not download to windows 8?,,"As I understand it ,it was based on Windows 98, then XP would run it then the one we have was patched for windows 7 but I'm sure I've head there is no or very little Dos in Windows 8"
4411,open-ended,B004PYH7X0,cannot install: Does anyone have a similar problem?,,"I have windows 7 and it worked perfectly on mine. Do you have the full windows 7. On my previous laptop, I had windows 7 starter. I am not disputing it is not working on some windows 7's but I have a dell and it worked fine on mine. It also is a little slow on loading. Try deleting any portions of it from your computer and then put the disc back in and try again. Maybe something went wrong the 1st time and if it sees any of the ""oregon trail"" on your computer, it may think that it is already loaded."
4412,yes/no,B004PYH7X0,is this compatible with windows 8?,Y,"The copy I bought did not even work on Windows 7, but as I recall, when I got it, it turned out not to be the right version. So, it's possible that it will if you actually get a copy that was designed for Windows 7. If it just says in the add that it is compatible, but it is old, it probably won't work. If it's cheap enough, it might be worth taking to risk to see, but in my experience, it didn't work."
4413,open-ended,B004Q0N9US,Is this a 32Bit or 64Bit version of the software?,,R2 is 64 bit only.
4414,yes/no,B004Q0N9US,Does this version come with user cal's?,Y,Yes 5 cals
4415,yes/no,B004Q0N9US,Does it support 4 CPU servers,Y,Yes. 4 is the max physical CPU count it supports.
4416,open-ended,B004Q0N9US,Does this come with a disk or is it downloaded from the cloud?,,comes with a disk.
4417,open-ended,B004Q0N9US,This software comes with the Key license to enter on a previous server installation ?,,"Generally yes; sometimes the key will only work if the previous install is exactly the same version as this version. However, you could reinstall if there is a difference in versions, since you will have the installer disk."
4418,open-ended,B004Q0N9US,Is this 32-bit or 64-bit?,,64 Bit Only. There is no 32 bit 08 R2.
4419,open-ended,B004Q0N9US,User licences: How many users can I have with this version?,,"it actually comes with 5 CALs for which you choose whether they will be user or device CALs, in any combination not exceeding five. You choose this once; legally you are not permitted to alter this choice later."
4420,yes/no,B004Q0N9US,can this be run in vmware virtual machine? do you have a product key provided,Y,"Yes, this can be run in a vmware virtual machine. It actually includes two license keys, the primary key and a separate license key in the packaging for the virtual server deployment. If you go with vmware you lose some of the licensing benefit by having only one key be legally usable, but if you go with hyper-v, this essentially means you may use the physical machine license key on the host server, configure hyper-v, and then use the virtual machine license key on a virtual machine on that host, giving you two usable OS installs for the price of one."
4421,open-ended,B004Q0N9US,Is this the retail version or oem?,,I think that it is the retail version. I had just bought it for the lic code.
4422,open-ended,B004Q0PT3I,Can I install this on my Windows XP computer and make it WIndows 7? How much space does it use? THanks!,,"Hi Really depends on the age of your machine. This version is for system builders, meaning you'd have to wipe windows xp and install win7 fresh. This won't upgrade an existing windows installation. If your machine is older than 4 years, I'd suggest a new machine. The install took 15gb of my hard disk"
4423,yes/no,B004Q0PT3I,Is there a product key with this program???,Y,Yes there is.
4424,open-ended,B004Q0PT3I,I need to know if this will work on a new build computer ??? Im building my own system for running CAD programs so I need to do a full install,,Yes. Almost all modern CPU's and chipsets are 64-bit. Can't speak for AMD but for Intel it's Core 2 Duo and later are 64-bit.
4425,yes/no,B004Q0PT3I,Will the 64 bit version of Windows 7 work well on a 32 bit computer?,?,Impossible. 64 bit programs only work on 64 bit computers. 32 bit programs will work on both 64 bit and 32 bit computers.
4426,open-ended,B004Q0PT3I,Is this an upgrade disc or the full installation DVD? I need to install windows on a Mac but I need to know the difference from the $199 DVD?,,"This is a full install dvd, but only for a clean drive. I'm guessing the one for $199 is an upgrade...I would suggest Win 8.1."
4427,yes/no,B004Q0PT3I,I just ordered this product to upgrade from OEM installed Vista on my laptop. Will there be any installation issues?,Y,I upgraded from Vista on 2 computers. it was a hands off success. Both of them work significantly better now.
4428,yes/no,B004Q0PT3I,"can this version, since it is an OEM, be used for installation using boot camp on an early 2011 macbook pro?",?,"Absolutely. I installed Windows 7 on a late 2009 iMac via boot camp. I am running Mountain Lion OS on my Mac by the way. Also, my Mac has a 2.66 ghz processor and 8 GB of RAM. Windows 7 runs flawlessly, buttery smooth and lightning fast. You will love it. My only regret is I should have made the partition larger. I only devoted 80 GB to Windows, I wish i had devoted 200 GB of my 1 terabyte drive. Also, when you get to the point of formatting the drive during installation when Windows starts, choose ADVANCED and format the partition in the NTSB format. Windows will only run in this format, NOT the default FAT format that boot camp creates."
4429,yes/no,B004Q0PT3I,Can you install this on a Mac with Parallels?,Y,Yes you can. I did that and it worked but the game performance was too slow to suit my son. So we uninstalled it and installed it again using Boot Camp. This way it works much faster.
4430,yes/no,B004Q0PT3I,"Hate Windows 8 !!! As a TOTAL non-tech person, would I be better off buying the ""Full"" rather than ""System Installer"" to get back to Wind 7?",?,"I myself am disappointed with Windows 8. I am a technical person and removing one operating system with another can be tricky depending upon the type of machine you have. After discussion with a local computer shop I do business with, told me they charge $200 for the operating system and the labor cost to replace. They are doing many replacements of this nature and having difficulty keeping windows 7 in stock for sale because of this. If you are not technical then replacing an operating system may be extremely difficult for you. With some laptops, for example, you have to change some BIOS settings before you can boot your machine from the installation disk. Do your research for your particular machine on how to replace 8 with 7 before you spend any money. Also look into a free program call ClassicShell with makes windows 8 screen look like Windows 7 after installation - start button and all. It has quirks but makes 8 more useable if you don't have a touch screen. Hope this helps. Best of luck to you in your endeavor."
4431,yes/no,B004Q0PT3I,"Installation: I need to know if I wipe my hard drive and start again,will there be issues?",Y,If you do a clean install you shouldn't have a problem. Sounds like your sims game is failing. Possibly you installed 64 bit and originally had 32bit?. That might be the problem with your game.
4432,open-ended,B004Q0PSMK,Is this the entire Windows 7 operating system or is it just the SP1 upgrade? Im not very computer literate and want to make sure before I click buy.,,Its the whole OS including SP1.
4433,open-ended,B004Q0PSMK,"Need to downgrade 5 identical Lenovo computers from Windows 7 64-bit to 32-bit for 3 months!! Do I buy 3 DVDs, or just 1 DVD and clone 5 hard disks?",,"Interesting scenario. Have you contacted Lenovo to see if they can send you 32 bit disks? Licensing forbids multiple installations from one license. Some of the Windows 7 came with virtual XP (32bit), could you app run on that?"
4434,open-ended,B004Q0PSMK,Dpes this come in a retail box or a cd holder with a code key on the back?,,"Mine came in a Windows 7 sealed boxed, cd holder with key code inside."
4435,open-ended,B004Q0PSMK,how many computers can I use this software?,,You have to buy a license for every individual computer you install the software on.
4436,open-ended,B004Q0PSMK,"If I have a problem and have to reinstall this Win7, can I re-install? Someone mentioned that it is a one time only install. Is that true?",,"Technically yes. However, the License is good for one PC and one installation, however you can perform an inplace repair installation (by using the upgrade option) by launching the setup program via the installation media from within Windows 7, and if you need to completely reinstall the operating system (where you might re-format the Hard Drive) despite it being activated a phone call to Microsoft's Activation hotline may allow you to use the key again as long as it's on the same computer. They're usually pretty helpful if something goes wrong with your 1st attempt at installing their software."
4437,yes/no,B004Q0PSMK,i have the 32 bit windows 7 pro w/4 gb ram. i was going to go to 8 gb but read that 32 bit will not read it. could i get a second opinion ?,?,Correct. You need 64 bit operating system to read over 4gb ram
4438,open-ended,B004Q0PSMK,I want to upgrade a Laptop currently with 32 bit version of Windows VISTA to Windows 7. What do I buy?,,"First things first. Make sure you have all of the Windows 7 drivers for your laptop motherboard. Also make sure it meets the minimum requirements for the OS. Any of the Windows 7 OS should work for you, except Enterprise of course. Hope this helps, good luck."
4439,open-ended,B004Q0PSMK,what is sp1? i have a 5 year old computer with windows xp.would my driver handle this?,,"sp1 means Service Pak 1 it is a consolidation of numerous patches,security updates and other updates to Windows 7. The minimum hardware requirements are: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit) 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver"
4440,yes/no,B004Q0PSMK,Does this Win7 come with a Product Activation Key? I noticed in some of the comments that they had problems in finding a key or in registering.,N,"This is a fully functioning developer version factory sealed by Microsoft. The product key is included. I had no problems installing or registering, but this is NOT the retail version so you will not have any technical support available."
4441,open-ended,B004Q0PSMK,"i want to know, if I can upgrade from XP to 7, with this? Another question, is 1 gig ram enough to run 7?",,"2 GBs is the recommended minimum. I upgraded to Win 7 from XP, but I had 4 GBs memory. Works fine."
4442,open-ended,B004Q0T10A,Xp to 7,,"Hi David I can give you my experiance. I own a 3 year old Dell 410 desk top PC. It needed an upgrade to keep up with newer software. Step 1 More memory Max for this model. 2 New hard drive, went with the new Solid Sate Digital Drive 60 Gigabyte. To make this happen needed to purchace Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 32bit (OEM) System Builder DVD 1 Pack. OS does have support for SSD drives, with other experienced tweaks these were the results. Windows XP to 7 with the upgrades mentioned. The entire prosses took me about 3 hours. 2 hours to install 7 and all my other software. Has run flawless out of the box. computer start up went from 5 to 7 minutes to 92 secounds. from user screen log on it was 3.5 minutes now 23 seconds. All made possible by the product you want to purchase. I hope this helps."
4443,open-ended,B004Q0T10A,where is the windows office with WORD program?,,"Microsoft's Office with ""Word"" has never been included with Windows 7 Home Premium. It is purchased individually as a separate product. Back 2 or 3 years ago MS office was included in most new laptop and PC purchases but this has also stopped being true. What most new laptops and PC's offer is Microsoft Office starter. This is a reduced functionality Word and Excel with advertising. Pretty much useless. There is ""Open Office"" which is free, fully functional and compatible to Microsoft office. Just Google around for it, you'll find it. There is also Google business apps which is finally beginning to cut into Microsoft's market share, however... it is cheap, but not free. Good Luck!"
4444,yes/no,B004Q0T10A,can i install windows 7 premium (oem)sys.builder dvd 1pack on more than one machine?,N,"No you cannot. You must have one unique (paid for) Product Key for each machine you want to install Windows 7 on. The System Builder DVD gives you one product key good for one machine only. You can buy additional licenses, however. I don't know the details of how to use or take advantage of Microsoft's ""Volume Licensing"". I don't install Microsoft Operating Systems in large enough volume to justify the cost of a volume license. However the idea is you get one product key per machine -- something like that. What you can be sure of is that if you install a Microsoft Operating System from a DVD, be prepared to type in a unique, paid-for product key for each machine you install on. You can browse http://www.microsoft.com/oem to get more information about their System Builder program, including the licensing."
4445,open-ended,B004Q0T10A,What is the difference between the OEM version and the Full Upgrade version other than the price? I am planning to upgrade from an old XP system.,,You will be far better off doing a fresh install rather than an upgrade. Definitely worth the price difference.
4446,yes/no,B004Q0T10A,I have a Dell 32 bit laptop....it has Vista..is this what I want to change to Windows 7??,?,That would be the best thing you could do for your computer and your piece of mind. I feel it is better then Windows 8.
4447,yes/no,B004Q0T10A,can i install windows 7 if i am running windows 8 right now ??,N,Not with this product unless you format your hard drive first.
4448,yes/no,B004Q0T10A,Will it update VISTA?,N,"As I read it, after I got it is NO. It will not update anything unless, you completely format your hard drive, since it is for new computers, and not an upgrade. That is what I wanted and when I got this I couldn't even understand what I was supposed to do. You have to buy another program to get ready to install this one. So my answer would be no upgrade for any operating system. I wanted it for XP, but have a Vista too, NADA, as I read it. I sent it back and Amazon is amazing in handling returns. Thanks Amazon............."
4449,open-ended,B004Q0T10A,i have a ibm thinkpad with a partial install (failed) can i wpe and install as a clean drive or do i have to have a system to work off of.,,"I have installed Windows on hard drives that were brand new and just had the original factory formatting. Once started in the CDROM drive Windows would check the new drive for formatting, format if necessary, and then proceed to install itself on the new drive."
4450,yes/no,B004Q0T10A,"Can I install win7 home premium over win 8, which hate",?,This is new install so it wipes any other OS and ALL FILES that you have previously loaded. Be sure to backup your files first and have the media to reinstall the programs or apps that you run.
4451,yes/no,B004Q0T10A,Will I be able to do Microsoft Word?,Y,Yes There Is A version For Windows 7 Probably Available For Download If You Do Not Have It Already
4452,yes/no,B004Q0PTD8,can i replace windows 8 basics with windows 7 professional on my desktop help,Y,"Yes, I hated Win 8 that came with my laptop. I bought Win 7 Ultimate on Amazon, took the laptop to a local computer house and had them wipe Win 8 and install Win 7. Been using it ever since. Win 8 is not suitable for a mostly business computer. It is for tablets."
4453,open-ended,B004Q0PTD8,how do you install Windows 7 Professional on new SSD drive?,,The same way as if it was a regular hard drive. Can you be more specific? What kind of issue are you having with installation of windows 7?
4454,open-ended,B004Q0PTD8,how many computers can i install this on,,One. Multipack will be more expensive. But if u just buy this one u can still install on another computer and within 30 days you can purchase additional code from Microsoft for full activation on the second computer
4455,yes/no,B004Q0PTD8,Is Microsoft Office included in this operating system,?,No it's a seperate software. But the operating system is a good rock to throw it on.
4456,open-ended,B004Q0PTD8,"I'm about to buy my first gaming PC and I can't decide between Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 Ultimate, which works better?",,"I love my Windows7Ultimate64 but I am OLD SCHOOL!, They say Windows8.1 has less FAT and more slimlined interactivity. Windows7 has good support for now but will end some day. Windows 8.1 will take some getting use to. I would go with Windows7 but as I said I AM OLD SCHOOL"
4457,yes/no,B004Q0PTD8,Can I use this product to upgrade my Windows 7 professional to windows 7 ultimate WITHOUT having to format the machine?,?,You should be able to
4458,open-ended,B004Q0PTD8,Can I do an in-place install to my Windows Vista Home Premium 64 or must I do a clean install?,,"You must do an clean install. Vista Ultimate was upgradeable to Win 7 Ultimate. Truth is you maybe able to do an ""Upgrade"" but your License Key is not likely to work even on an upgrade. Your best bet is to backup, verify you have your drivers and your applications at hand, then delete the partitions. Reloading to clean partitions is your best chance of success."
4459,yes/no,B004Q0PTD8,Do you just install it in your computer like a software ?,Y,Yes
4460,open-ended,B004Q0PTD8,What 60gb ssd would you recommend me for this OS?,,"Well I use a Samsung 830 Series 256GB SSD in my gaming laptop. Never had any problems with it. Do not ever defragment one or you'll ruin it! I would go with at least a 128 GB SSD such as a Samsung 840 EVO-Series 120GB SSD. Also don't bother with the software that comes with it. More people run into trouble using buggy software. Run it as is - set to ACHI in BIOS and enable TRIM mode. Lifehacker has tips on ""How to Maximize the Life of Your SSD"". If you really just want a 60 GB go with Kingston Digital 60GB SSD."
4461,yes/no,B004Q0PTD8,"does ""system builder"" make this different from regular win 7?",?,The actually operating system is no different. Just the legality of its use.
4462,open-ended,B004Q0T0LU,The infamous OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) [and why you don't need it] What horrible fate awaits the PC user who fails to install the OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) before installing Windows 7?,,Thanks for the TRUTH. Just another Microsoft bloat-ware gotta-have dont-be-left-out press-here-for-important-blah-blah-blah
4463,yes/no,B004Q0T0LU,Can it be installed on multiple computers,N,"No, this is an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and single use disc for installation on new build. I would also recommend new motherboard and memory if you decide to buy. With 64bit you are not limited to 3GB memory maximum on 32bit systems. I purchased this item because I was dumping all my 32bit windows XP Professional systems and building new 64bit systems with multiple cores and maximum memory.

It was close to $400.00 and believe me, if I didn't have so much of my past invoices and hundreds of inventory items in this piece of junk software, I would have used anything else to run my business.

Most windows operating systems allow you to run software backwards compatable. It's usuully in the install or properties dialogue box where you simply check a box.
4580,yes/no,B004V2H3DA,Would this be useful for someone that types with just one hand? One handed typing program on amazon wasn't useful can't seem to find anything,?,I don't believe so. Check their website to see if that feature exists...

4613,open-ended,B004YHXXHC,COREL PAINTER 12 Education edition vs regular edition: Can someone please point out the differences?,,"@E. Ocasio -- Sorry, but your honest, reliable friend is dead wrong. It took me about thirty seconds to find the End User License Agreement on Corel's website. The EULA specifically states that the education edition can be used ""only for educational purposes and for no other purpose. Academic versions of the Software may not be used for commercial, professional, or other for-profit purposes."" In the next paragraph, the EULA again states in plain English, ""If this Software is clearly labeled a Student and Teacher, Home and Student or Home Edition ... you may not ... use this Software for any commercial purpose or in any commercial enterprise or business."" As for eligibility requirements, the EULA clearly states, ""You are not entitled to use the Software unless you qualify in your jurisdiction as an academic end user (e.g., student or personal learning versions of the Software may only be used by faculty, staff members and degree-, diploma- or certificate-seeking students at qualified educational institutions)."" Since the education edition is used as a learning tool, I would assume that all of the tools and features are the same in this and the ""regular"" version, however, the EULA states ""Work product and other data created with academic or education edition versions of the Software may contain certain notices and limitations that make the data unusable outside the educational use area."" I am not a student so I would not risk my hard-earned cash on a product that I may or may not be able to register, activate and use. Also, I would not want to spend hours working on a project just to find out my completed artwork is tainted with ""certain notices and limitations that make the data unusable."" Moreover, using the education edition to make any type of profit, according to the terms of the EULA, is flat-out illegal. Simple as that. Think about it -- why would Corel price their product at $379 when anyone, student or not, could instead purchase a heavily-discounted educational edition for only $99? It doesn't make sense. To give you another example, Adobe sells Photoshop Extended CS5.5 for $999, while their educational equivalent is currently priced at $199 -- a difference of $800! Using your logic, any professional photographer (as I am), graphic artist, web designer, publishing firm, or architect could purchase the product at just 20% of its retail price and use the software in their business to turn a profit. It's ridiculous to think that Corel or Adobe would be okay with that! The terms of these companies' EULAs are very simple to understand. It doesn't take a rocket scientist, brain surgeon, or even a ""certified pc technician"" to get it."
4614,yes/no,B004YHXXHC,I have a newer mac laptop with no CD-ROM drive. Can I buy this and use its license key for the download edition?,N,"No, you have to have the cd to be able to use this edition, the code will not work for the download."
4615,open-ended,B004YHXXHC,I will use Painter for cartooning colors (like in comic books) any reason the educational version wouldnt work for me?

4616,yes/no,B004YHXXHC,I am homeschooled. Do I need to have proof of a school to use it?,N,"We homeschool too, Cory. No, you do not need proof. Good luck with it; we are loving the education edition here!"

4619,open-ended,B004YHXXHC,What cant I use it for?,,It's just like painting but better. I don't use it as much as I would like to but I have a friend who is doing remarkable work with fine art photographs. He uses a photo as a base and works with painter to create some wonderful art. The program is robust and will require a steep learning curve. Best to take some on-line tutorials. Good luck.
4620,yes/no,B004YHXXHC,Does Painter 12 allow for a gradient hilight (called a screen in PS CS3) that creates coloring FX as seen in modern comics?,?,"I don't know what ""coloring FX"" means, but, of course, one can bucket fill using diverse gradient pattern presets, and create any kind of gradient pattern for use when filling. One can also paint with a clone brush of any kind (oil, water colour, etc.) that clones from a standard gradient picture so that each brush stroke creates a gradient in itself. Painter 12 is suitable for artistic use, that is, ""hand painting"". Technical picture manipulation can be done even more effectively with other programs, such as PaintShop Pro X6. Note that Painter 12 works best with double cores and a good amount of RAM. But most people have such computers today. /Mats"

So if you like doing this for hobby and projects for personal reasons, the Educational one is the way to go. If you're selling artwork like commissions and stuff, or a professional - get the retail version.

So does that mean it is legal and safe to buy it from Amazon?,,"Been thinking about this myself...at time of this post Corel had raised it's price to $350 while Amazon had dropped theirs to $200, normally this would be a no-brainer except that a lot of the comments referenced serial numbers not working and dealing with Corel customer support for a product not purchased from them directly.

4645,open-ended,B004ZZO07U,What is included in the box?,,"It has been quite a few years since I got this program, but I believe that at that time two program cds were included and approximately 9 or 10 audio cds that had the same lessons as the computer program, but for listening on a cd player, and a little lesson book that followed the program as well. I have the program installed on two computers and have gone thru the lessons multiple times. I used to listen to the audio cds in the car as well, but have not done that in a few years. For me, I much prefer the software cds that I can load into a computer to play as often when and where I want and for as long. On-line subscription learning is not for me as it expires and also requires an internet connection. I got verb modules II and III as well from this company, but I do not believe they were as well done as Level I. This is because I felt they skewed the lessons to be more for young students where games and ""video learning machines"" needed to be part of the lesson approach. However, the tutorial parts of all lessons were still well done and explains things in a logical way for me."
4646,yes/no,B004ZZO07U,Does this work on Windows 8?,?,"Sorry, I don't have Windows 8 but Visual Link has a website you can google. Maybe you can find the answer or ask there."
4647,yes/no,B0050TVAWS,I was bilked by someone on Ebay into buying a bogus Windows7 Home Premium package. Will this install over it ?,?,"Backup your vital files, and do a clean install. Aka... boot from the server disc, format the drive, and use it as a server os, not a workstation. Installing over something is not really a viable path, in my humble opinion. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/install-configure-2.aspx"
4648,open-ended,B0050TVAWS,"How well does this work in a Mac environment? I just need shared storage, nothing fancy. Just be able to see the drives and use the files on them.",,It works perfect. I shuttle files back and forth between my Macbook Pro and WHS 2011 all the time.
4649,open-ended,B0050TVAWS,Once it is installed can anything be done on the actual computer? Or remotely only? Can it be used as a desktop? DirectX? Home Theater PC?,,"There are about three basic functions of this software: 1) automatically backup all PC's/Mac's on the LAN, 2) be used as a master storage repository for files, and 3) play stored multi-media. It has Internet Explorer installed, but it's really bad practice to expose the server to the internet by using surfing from the server; better to use another computer. It has Windows Media Center installed, but the crippled version will not permit you to remotely log onto the server and play music from speakers attached to the server; you must be logged in at the server locally to do this. Finally, you cannot use the server like a corporate server hosting business applications that you simply use from the server; software licensing issues prevent this capability. See my review on this product for more info on its pros and cons."
4650,yes/no,B0050TVAWS,Does this work with win8 machines on the home network?,Y,Yes
4651,open-ended,B0050TVAWS,I am looking for a simple to use home server software. Would you recommend 2011 WHS or 2012 MS Server Esentials?,,"2012 MS ServerEssentials. 2011 WHS is based on windows server 2008, which will be sun-setting pretty soon. The only drawback to using 2012 is that the connection to ""client"" computers is through use of a ""domain"" to tie all the client computers into a single network. The old method was to have the server connect directly with each client machine - you didn't have to be part of a domain in order to use the server. 2011 WHS uses the ""old"" method."
4652,yes/no,B0050TVAWS,"Hi, Can you run x86 32 bit programs on 64 bit WHS 2011 as you can on Win 7. Thanks",?,"I can't say that I know the answer to this for certain - but generally speaking Windows will run 32 bit programs if it is a 64 bit OS. I don't see why WHS would be any different than Win7. I just did quick check on mine and I have two programs that I know are 32 bit running on my WHS so there should be no problem. Best way to check is install - if they work, great, if not - just uninstall. That's assuming you already have the programs you want to install of course, if not then cross your fingers; seriously though I think you won't have a problem as long as it is a windows program it should run. The only problems I have ever had with 32 bit programs is if they were ancient, then it can become problematic. Good luck."
4653,yes/no,B0050TVAWS,can it run on a computer like windows 7 so i can use it like a normal pc?,Y,It is a bad concept for anything but amusement use of computers. There shoud be an upgrade based on productivity of other software.
4654,open-ended,B0050TVAWS,10 CAL's - Does that mean that up to 10 PC's can connect to the server PC at the same time with good speed without someone getting booted off?,,"Can you clarify ""connect to the server""? If you mean, ""...connect to a resource or share..."" then yes. ""Good speed"" would be a function of your ethernet or wireless networking connecting to that server but yes, you could have 10 simultaneous connections. NOTE: you can do the same thing in Windows 7 and 8 as they will allow up to 20 simultaneous connections to the shared resource on Pro and Ultimate. If you mean connect to Remote Desktop, then no. It does not have any Terminal Server CALS. Remote Desktop is for administration only. Hope this helps."
4655,open-ended,B0050TVAWS,I have the original WHS and I would like to upgrade. Do I have to uninstall the old one first or will it update?,,"Excellent question. My experience with Windows Servers in the past is that upgrading from an installed server should work, but I would image the server (back it up so you can do a full restore if necessary) and then try the upgrade. The other problem I have had with in-place upgrades is that they sometimes leave messes behind that can be difficult to sort out. When it comes to servers I have generally always done a clean install - a little more time consuming but much cleaner. Just make sure you have a good backup of everything before you start. If you have a program that can create an image of the server - even better. Good luck and let me know how it comes out."
4656,yes/no,B0050TVAWS,Not one word about printer sharing. Does this software support printer sharing?,?,Yes....Windows Home Server 2011 does support printer sharing. All MS Windows OS support printer sharing.
4657,open-ended,B00519868I,does it have math games or quizzes?,,The entire program revolves around engaging math games that keep a child's interest as they purchase a pet and help to train it as they answer and learn math.
4658,yes/no,B00519868I,does it work with windows 8.1,?,"I know it works with windows 7., not sure about windows 8.1."
4659,open-ended,B00519868I,Encore Software Elementary Advantage 2012 Desktop Short Cut - How do I do it?,,"I think I clicked on the start menu, then ""all programs"" and then on encore. This should display a file and an icon for the game. You an launch the game from the icon or drag it to the desktop to create a shortcut. I hope that's right."
4660,yes/no,B00519868I,could this program be used for a complete home school curriculum?,?,"No. I really like this program, and it has helped my daughter immensely. She likes doing it and that is, from what I've learned, about 60% of the battle. But it can't be a complete curriculum. My opinion is that it is the best reinforcement for what you teach at home. I'd go with AlphaOmega and when the days coursework is done, turn them loose on this as a ""treat"" for as long as they want. With my daughter I don't allow any TV until she ""goes up a level"" in something. The pleasant surprise is that she forgets that she only had to level-up one and keeps going for a long time."
4661,open-ended,B00519868I,What academic areas does this program focus on?,,"Hi, this was a gift for my grand kid who is on the 3rd grade, her mom says that this is a great program and challenging for her daughter. Therefore I could not give you more info. My grand kid is advance in learning, so based on my daughter's response I think is a good buy. This is just my opinion. I hope this helps."
4662,open-ended,B0051M6I9O,"two packages the same? What is the difference between this product (""Sony Creative Software Movie Studio HD Platinum 11"") and the very similar product with a slightly different name (""Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 11 Production Suite"" by Sony...",,"No they are slightly different, look at the pictures in both and you will see. The one is the production suite, the other is not. Similar overall product, not the same extras."
4663,open-ended,B0051M6I9O,So it works on Windows 8....do you have to download a patch or anything? Thanks,,When I installed mine it didn't ask for a patch so I'm going to say no. ^.^
4664,open-ended,B0051M6I9O,"I have been doing slide shows on the computer for years using the one supplied, so I can do slide shows with this program?",,definitively... hell you can a movie on this software.
4665,yes/no,B0051M6I9O,Can you import video from old hi-8 digital tapes?,Y,Yes
4666,yes/no,B0051M6I9O,Will this run on Windows 8? Thank you.,Y,Yes
4667,open-ended,B0051M6I9O,"Can you use this for a laptop with Windows 7? If not, any suggestions on what software you can use? Preferably Sony Vegas.",,Yes
4668,open-ended,B0051M6I9O,Does it handle mp4 files? Can it handle a 1.2 gig file? Can it work with laptop video?,,Never got that far I had a new laptop and it froze when I tried to use it.. when I tried to use it for making movies for my video class and it wouldnt work..
4669,open-ended,B0051M6I9O,How effective is the image stabilization utility?,,I couldn't really tell u I wasn't able to use it but it seemed stable.. but I had to stop using it because it caused my computer to freeze...
4670,open-ended,B0051M6I9O,Which build version is this (e. g. 11.0.0.322 or 11.0.295 or 11.0.75) ? Thank you,,Not sure what build version it is since I can't find the original specs and disc it came with. I also had to change my PC 2 months ago so I haven't re-installed on the hard drive. Sorry.
4671,open-ended,B0051M6I9O,Will this software play Blu-ray discs? If so how well laid out is the movie player (if there is one)?,,"This software use Apple Quicktime, and Windows Media Player 9, to play the movie clips you have made and preview your compilation. I don't know much about Apple software, but Media player versions 7 and above all play BlueRay discs, so you should be able to preview BluDisc clips and rendered files. I don't know if you can use Veags studio as a media player program, as it will only play the video in the preview panel. Probably will not give you access to the menu and settings part of your disc. Of course you must have a BluRay DVD drive on your computer."
4672,open-ended,B0051M6JZW,How do I get the product key?,,There should be several little fold-over booklets inside the box. One of them has the product keys.
4673,open-ended,B0051M6JZW,Can you add things such as words and/or pictures ?,,Yes. You can also do green screen etc.. in Vegas movie studio platinum.
4674,yes/no,B0051M6JZW,Does this software include DVD Architect Studio?,?,It includes DVD Architect Studio 5.0
4675,open-ended,B0051M6JZW,"Does anyone know it this version will work with Windows 7 Pro, 64bit? Thanks",,Yes
4676,yes/no,B0051M6JZW,"Can I join videos together from youtube, and re -upload them as one?",Y,You can't directly download from YouTube but if you use another tool to download the videos you can. Bear in mind Windows Movie maker on Windows 7 and above supports this and is free. Also bear in mind that it is against YouTube's terms of service to download any video.
4677,yes/no,B0051M6JZW,Can I use this software to burn movies to dvds?,?,If the file will open.
4678,yes/no,B0051M6JZW,Is Sony creative Imagination Studio 3 compatible with Windows 8? please answer,Y,Yes
4679,yes/no,B0051M6JZW,Are these programs compatible with Windows 8?,?,"The side of the box reads .. ""Windows XP (Service Pack 3), Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) or Windows 7."
4680,yes/no,B0051M6JZW,Will this software act as a simple dvd player for pre-recorded movies?,?,You should use VLC or Windows Media Player for that.
4681,open-ended,B0051M6JZW,Anyone know if this comes with a complimentary Sony Loops download for the included ACID? I'm referring to their Loops site not a CD...,,"Came with mostly worthless loops. They didn't install automatically. Had to search for them and drag them off the installation cd. Also the same deal with 1001 sound effects. Good software, good deal overall."
4682,yes/no,B0051M6IPI,Can you import mp4 videos? Was looking through the features and it didnt note mp4. Unless i'm blind.,Y,"yes, I imported .mp4 for editing. thanks"
4683,yes/no,B0051M6IPI,"Can this editor zoom in on a specific section of a video? e.g. view just the top left of a video., and make that that section larger",Y,"Yes, in the pan/crop tool, but unfortunately, most of the time when you zoom that much, the picture will become fuzzy just like zooming in any other program or device."
4684,yes/no,B0051M6IPI,Will this work on windows 8,Y,"Yes, it works fine on both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1."
4685,yes/no,B0051M6IPI,Can you take 2 separate videos and make them into one?,Y,Yes you can !
4686,open-ended,B0051M6IPI,"Can you do split screen with this software? Also, can you have more than 2 audio tracks at the same time?",,Yes and yes.
4687,yes/no,B0051M6IPI,"I've been using Windows Live Movie Maker to edit video, but am tired of dealing with that program's numerous glitches. Is this a good upgrade?",?,"I'm glad I made the move to Sony Vegas. Not that I didn't enjoy Movie Maker, but Vegas gives me so much more control. Also, I can see things on TV or in a movie and think about it a minute, then realize I can make the same effect happen with Vegas. It just takes some practice. Also, you'll want to acquire Bill Myers' 101 Tips and Tricks DVD. It will give you a great idea of just how much you can accomplish on Vegas and how easy it is, once you learn the tricks."
4688,yes/no,B0051M6IPI,Will Work with WIN 64 Pro 64 Bit,N,No
4689,yes/no,B0051M6IPI,I read the description but I'm techno challenged. I want to create a DVD with chapters you can select. Will this software allow me to do that?,?,"Vegas will allow you to insert chapter markers wherever you want them in the timeline. You can also custom-name them. After you edit your video project with chapter markers and all, you select a rendering template (you can also customize a template if you wish). Ideally, you should select a template (customized or not) which is compatible with Sony's DVD Architect software (also included on disc in the box). Make sure to check the box in the template which allows you to keep the chapter markers in the rendered video. Once rendered, you put the video and audio files into a folder for DVD Architect (video and audio files should be rendered separately, but in the same folder). The folder should also contain a .sfl file so your chapter markers will also carry over into DVD Architect. You then import the rendered video into DVD Architect and select to create a chapter menu. Just import the video; the audio and .sfl files will follow automatically. That is when you can create a menu system based on where you inserted chapter markers in Vegas. To speed things along, you can simply select ""make movie"" in Vegas which will automatically send the appropriate files to DVD Architect. However, I've found that taking the more complex route of selecting a rendering template and customizing it does yield a much better picture when the final DVD is burned. Selecting ""make movie,"" I've found tends to compromise picture quality on the completed DVD."
4690,open-ended,B0051M6IPI,Hello I have a Puppet Production Company that shoots video commercials for businesses and Events importing company logos into the video is easy? and I was previously using Movie Maker but need something more advanced and easy to use.,,"If you are experienced with sony software then there are option s when you start the program one of them is ""show me how"" it basically shows you what to do when importing image file its easy as drag and drop"
4691,yes/no,B0051M6IPI,"I'm interested in this program for Youtube music videos, can you do split screens with this program?",?,"This is great software program however it will not perform split screens. It has several advantages and is just below the professional grade software. This version also includes the 200 music tracks, the audio version that allows you to splice music, and the DVD menu software that allows you to include video as a background for main and sub menus. The help menus provides good support and you can save your finished project in multiple formats. I would recommend to purchase this software since other companies that have the split screen (which I do have) will not work after the recent Microsoft update. I purchased this as a backup until the issue would get resolved (going on 5 months). This Sony version is now my primary video software. Hope this helps."
4692,open-ended,B0052VKOYO,recommended age: Would you recommend this?,,"Creating animations takes a bit of time and can also be quite rewarding. If this 11 year old is willing to spend some time to play around with the features of this product, read parts of the quick start guide, check out the tutorials online and get inspired by the countless animations on the product's Facebook page - facebook.com/animestudio - then I would definitely recommend that you buy it. I am aware of some awesome 15 year olds that animate using Anime Studio, and are quite good at. My opinion is also that if you can get an 11 year old, or a teenager for that matter, to stop playing single player shooter games all day long, and try something more creative then it's worth the money. I also believe that this would be a great product for a parent and child to use together and work on simultaneous projects, that way they can feed of of each other's energies and spend some quality time together. Hope this was helpful."
4693,yes/no,B0052VKOYO,Help. Product key will not work? Is it the same product key for both mac and pc.,?,"I do not know about the product key but I did not find Anime Studio to be helpful. It took a team of fellow computer wizards to come to the conclusion it is very limited. Maybe a good start to learning animation? But to use this to apply, not so much."
4694,yes/no,B0052VKOYO,Can this work with Windows 8?,?,"I don't know. I have Win Vista. It works well there. - But Smith Micro, the manufacturer can answer that question. (Of course, they'll try to sell you the latest version, but the info should be there.) - Usually, the Windows stuff is scalable."
4695,yes/no,B00532UT7Y,I do not have MS office on my computer. Does the key card work for initial installation on my computer?,?,"Yes it does. Unfortunately Microsoft has moved their download website for Office 2010 and the one on the box is invalid with no forwarding to the new one. Go to the Microsoft website and search on ""Office 2010 Backup"". It will direct you to a site where you can enter your Program Key and download the program. The download takes about 45 minutes with high speed internet. It will also give you the option to purchase the DVD/CD's for about $13."
4696,open-ended,B00532UT7Y,"Is this a permanant download, or is it a year subscription?",,This is a permanent download. It brings only a product code that allows you download Microsoft Office 2010.
4697,yes/no,B00532UT7Y,Is this compatible with Windows 8.1 OS?,Y,"Yes, I put Office-2010 on my Windows-8, now upgraded to 8.1 PC with no problems."
4698,yes/no,B00532UT7Y,Are any of these Home &amp; Student software made in the USA?,?,"It is my understanding that the Office program is written in the USA by Microsoft. If you are only ordering the ""Product Keycard"" you don't get a CD/DVD, so made in USA is moot. If you only purchased the ""Product Keycard"" you have the option to order one DVD from Microsoft for about $12, unfortunately the ones I received are off site, so don's know were the DVD's were made. My Windows-7 OEM & Windows-8 OEM say made in USA. My old Office Home and Student 2010 (Family Pack for 3 PCs) say made in Puerto Rico."
4699,open-ended,B00532UT7Y,how many downloads come with this software?,,one...
4700,yes/no,B00532UT7Y,Does it have Excel?,Y,yes
4701,yes/no,B00532UT7Y,Is it possible to get the product code e-mailed to me while the package is in transit?,Y,"Yes, but will be non refundable"
4702,open-ended,B00532UT7Y,"I live in Brazil, If I buy this Key Card, Amazon will send me a 25-digit product key by email or an actual credit-card like card with the product key?",,The key is printed on a card and included in the package. There is simply no media/disc included with the software.
4703,yes/no,B00532UT7Y,Microsoft no longer sells Office 2010. Will the key card still work?,Y,"Yes, but it is rather hard to find the Office 2010 installation files now that Microsoft is pushing Office 2013. Go to the Microsoft web site, and search on ""Office 2010 Backup"". It will offer you a download (takes about 45 minutes) or the purchase of the DVD/CD for about $13. If a friend already has the DVD/CD use it and your ""Product Key"" to save the download time."
4704,open-ended,B00532UT7Y,what is a key card?,,"A key card is a card that is located inside the packaging. The number is hidden by a scratch off material. Use a penny or something to scratch the material off to reveal the code. Go to Microsoft Office website, enter in the number with your account information and you can download the software."
4705,yes/no,B0053N8ARO,"does it have blank pages that you can add objects into like backgrounds, border &amp; frames from other than the software program",?,It has a blank page and I am able to add photos etc. Had difficulty putting in a border but it may be I need more practice. I have only used it twice so I'm not much of an expert. Sorry I cannot help more
4706,yes/no,B0053N8ARO,Will this program work with windows eight?,Y,Yes it is compatible with Windows 8 32bt & 64bt as long as you have .NET installed.
4707,yes/no,B0053N8ARO,will it work with windows vista?,Y,"Nothing works with Vista and I had to almost go buy all new software. I finally got rid of my Vista. I think it does but not easily. My advice is get rid of Vista! And don't buy Windows 8 either, that's crap. Find a refurbished Windows 7, great operating system!"
4708,open-ended,B0053N8ARO,Does this run on Win 8 and does it have blank templates for newsletters or 5x7 cards? I used Creatacard for years but that will not run on win 8.,,this is a great program i'm using it on XP so don't know about 8 I guess I'll find out soon
4709,yes/no,B0053N8ARO,Will it import projects from earlier versions?,?,I had no problem with this at all.
4710,yes/no,B0053N8ARO,is this software for mac computers,Y,I have PrintMaster version 18.1 and it works Ok with Windows 7 . I chose this older version because it is simplier and easier to work with.
4711,yes/no,B0053N8ARO,does it print addresses on envelopes,Y,yes
4712,yes/no,B005576Q6U,is it compatible with windows 8 ?,?,I'm running it successfully on Win 8 / 64bit / 6GB ram

4716,open-ended,B005576Q6U,Is this the disk or a download?,,It is a CD and is a great program for the money.
4717,yes/no,B005576Q6U,Does it have electrical symbols ?,N,"No, so I purchased the add on 3 million symbol pack and was very disappointed. The absolute best is Visio 5 technical. See if you can find an old copy. It will only run on XP or earlier OS's. Do not use the new Visio as it sucks ever since Microsoft bought them out. Visio is a joy to use. I use it to do electrical layouts for marine applications."
4718,yes/no,B005576Q6U,Can this software be used to provide a design to a three dimensional printer?,?,"you can , but is only available in pro and platinum versions. I am using Deluxe."
4719,open-ended,B005576Q6U,"I build cabinets, shelves, display cases, etc. Will this work with these and other projects and will it calculate the amount of wood needed?",,"I used it to draw a deck for the back yard, and used the dimension application to calculated lengths and widths, etc. and the deck ended up pretty great. Since I was a CAD CAM Programmer at work, and using different software, the TurboCAD software I had at home fitted in smoothly to what I wanted to do with the deck. Mastering TurboCAD isn't going to hold back anything you're planning to fabricate, and plan material usage. It's surely worth the effort for Your own projects You want to engage in.."
4720,yes/no,B005576Q6U,"I saw one answered question saying the this program requires ""350 GB"" of space. That seems way too high. Could it be 350MB? Thanks.",N,Chris; I am operating v19. The requirement is 350MB not GB. I hope this helps.
4721,open-ended,B005576Q6U,If I draw something for say my left hand can Turbo Cad automatically reverse the design for the right hand without my having to redraw the design?,,Yes there is a mirror command within TurboCAD.
4722,yes/no,B0055A7RS8,Will it import address/contact list from Microsoft Outlook?,?,it does but did not do it completly it is not a great product I have used the V6 before and it was much better I think this is a waste of my money and time
4723,open-ended,B0055A7RS8,Why does the software request a calendar and contact list after I have entered the correct e-mail address and password and shows me a blank screen,,"Wilbur...I am not familiar with the fact that a calendar & contact list are ""required"". I didn't have this issue as well as having to enter e-mail address and password to access the software. If you think you are having issues with the software try uninstalling and then install again. Otherwise, you may have bad software and will need to contact Amazon or Individual Software. I have found 'AnyTime' to be glitchy and fraught with problems, so no surprises when I read others having issues. Poor quality product. Good luck!"
4724,yes/no,B0055A7RS8,Will this product load on several computers? If not I need one that does.,Y,"I, truly, DOUBT that this product will meet your needs. Fact is, since you need an active, internet connection, just to USE this product, I suggest that, if you want something you can use, on a variety of computers, try Day Minder Calendar. I have used the free, LITE, version, myself. This way, instead of paying, several times, for the same program, just to the ""Free Calendar Downloads"" site, such as Cnet.com, find Day Minder, and download a free copy, to each computer that you want to use it on."
4725,yes/no,B0055A7RS8,"Can I use AnyTimeOrganizer on several computers? I need it at on my old standard computer, my laptop and at my office.",?,"The license authorized use on one computer at a time. You can install it on two computers, but are licensed to use it on ONE COMPUTER AT A TIME. That is not a serious restriction, since I only use one at a time. I'm not a good enough multi-tasker to use several computers simultaneously. :-)"

4728,yes/no,B0055A7RS8,will this work in 8.1,?,"It will work with windows 8.1, but I do not use it because I found that I can use the google calendar in internet explorer for my work calendar and then use the calendar app in Google Chrome to synchronize my laptop calendar with the google calendar at work, and any changes I make on the stand alone calendar are synchronized when I attach to the work network. The synchronized period covers about 90 days and that is more than enough for when I am away from the office."

I didn't have this issue as well as having to enter e-mail address and password to access the software. If you think you are having issues with the software try uninstalling and then install again. Otherwise, you may have bad software and will need to contact Amazon or Individual Software. I have found 'AnyTime' to be glitchy and fraught with problems, so no surprises when I read others having issues. Poor quality product. Good luck!"
4734,yes/no,B0055A7RS8,Will this product load on several computers? If not I need one that does.,Y,"I, truly, DOUBT that this product will meet your needs. Fact is, since you need an active, internet connection, just to USE this product, I suggest that, if you want something you can use, on a variety of computers, try Day Minder Calendar. I have used the free, LITE, version, myself. This way, instead of paying, several times, for the same program, just to the ""Free Calendar Downloads"" site, such as Cnet.com, find Day Minder, and download a free copy, to each computer that you want to use it on."

I had a 600 series and the SD card worked great in France
4744,open-ended,B0055XNWJI,If ordered through Garmin they make that card at the time it is ordered. How old is this Europe map?,,"If ordered from Garmin, it should be the latest version. To find out the latest date, call Garmin customer service"

The post only shows a pic of Office 97 Professional, so I don't know which choices you are comparing? I'm no computer expert, either, but I would suggest it just depends on how you intend to use the programs. If you want it just for your own use then I would absolutely recommend Office 97. It's inexpensive and effecient. As stated below, you should be able to research the differences between the products you want to compare online. So again, depending on how you will use it, just be aware that Microsoft Office 2010 programs are pretty much incompatible with older versions. Which means if you will be receiving files from other sources that use 2010, you will be unable to open their files. There is a workaround for this, though. Just ask the sender to save the file as a .doc (Word) or .xls (Excel) before they send it to you."

I can tell you that the earlier versions of PA did do banners nicely; and, I would imagine they continued that aspect of the program. I have used Print Artist from the very beginning and was disappointed in how it works (or doesn't with Windows 7). The older versions are really great, and are a good way to learn these types of programs if you aren't familiar with them. I use PA 2003 with Windows 7 and it works great...was just hoping to use Platinum 24 because it should be outstanding given my past history with this software.

4831,yes/no,B005BE71LG,"this product ""Symantec Endpoin 12.1"" was published in 2011, is it still a valid version of Symantec?",Y,"Yes, we bought it two months ago after doing a chat with Symantec from their site and asking them if there is a newer version. It is the current version and was a much better price from Amazon than direct from Symantec. I'm not loving this product due to some poor tech support issues, but it mostly works and is current."

In terms of scanning, it is same as any scan software, you may use your computer's default scanner. What Paperport should excel is editing scanned documents, however it is so buggy you cannot use it. It is a good product in concept that could not mature in more than a decade."

The interface is not that much of a difference. However, if you are having problems adding an icon to the desktop, you may have to go through Windows Explorer and find the ""Quicken"" folder in ""Program Files (86)"" and send a shortcut to your desktop manually. If it installs okay, it should work fine."
4855,yes/no,B005CELLHK,can I use it on Mini MAc?,Y,"It's a Windows program, so first of all you'll need Parallels or another virtualizer to run Windows. Then it will work fine on a Mini. But you'll have to pay both for Parallels AND for Windows."
4856,yes/no,B005CELKLM,"Wow.... is Paperport 14 PRO as bad as everyone says? We were thinking about going paperless, but after reading the reviews, I have my doubts.",Y,"There is not much difference between v. 14 and v. 12. I own both. I have been using PaperPort on-and-off since it came bundled with one of my old scanners decades ago, and started using it full time when I bought an expensive all-in-one to go ""paperless"" from Konica Minolta in 2006. I purchased the standard version of v.12 directly from Nuance as it came with all of the extra pieces that made it ""better"" than just buying the pro version. That worked fine on my XP machine. The fun began when I decided to reinstall the program on a machine with Win7 this past few weeks. The software worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then, out of the blue, I got an error shutting it down on start-up. I researched this on Nuance's website and it had a fix listed for this error. However, the changes that you had to make to correct this problem were already done on the machine. I decided to give Nuance a call as I assumed it would be a quick fix they'd be able to direct me to over the phone. After being in hold-hell for an eternity, the ""tech"" that answered wanted twenty bucks to answer my question... and suggested that instead I pay to upgrade to v. 14. Ummm... Hello. I wasn't looking to be up-sold to the newest version (which, in reality I already own)... but... to get my still supported version working. I told him I was unwilling to pay twenty bucks for support (since 1) I was just installing the software; 2) the fixes on the website didn't work and 3) I could almost buy the newer release [which I already own] for almost the same money)... nor get sold a newer version as this one was supposedly still supported. He said ""Okay"" and hung up. Despite searching their knowledge base, I could never find a solution. I put in for ""eMail"" tech support, assuming I'd get a resolution, but instead got an email from the same tech I spoke to looking for $$ to answer my installation issue... and suggesting I pay to upgrade to v.14. I was pissed off. I already OWN v.14 but wanted to stick with v.12 because it's what I'm already using AND is still supported. Is it THAT difficult to understand? I reset the machine back to factory settings and tried to do a new install. Again, it worked (this time) for a few days. Having had enough, I dug through my boxes and pulled out the v.14 release. I installed it two days ago. I should note that on their ''support'' website my initial call was documented as ""resolved"" --- which to them obviously means it was resolved that I wouldn't pay them another nickel. Version 14 STANDARD is currently running without fixes. I kept the older version of their .PDF reader as the newer one that came with v.14 didn't have all of the features of the older one. I'm waiting to see whether this one continues to work or decides to crash and burn on me. I'm sure that if it does the later, they'll be looking to friction burn my credit card to resolve the issue with their bugged-out software. If that's the case, I'll be packing it up and moving over to FileCenter or some other alternative just to not have to deal with these bozo's. In my opinion, after having worked with software vendors since the first PC XT came out in 1983, these guys are in the business of selling you the latest and greatest, not supporting what they have on the street. I've NEVER had a technical support person attempt to get me to buy a paid upgrade on a still supported piece of software. I wonder if he's on commission!"

4893,yes/no,B005DM5QEK,Can I publish to Kindle from this software?,?,"Hi, Aleta. Actually, the very best software to publish to Kindle is a reasonably priced package called Anthemion Jutoh. WriteWay has a how-to publish to Kindle, Nook and Kobo in their help file, but it will not directly make Kindle files. Even Scrivener doesn't do the best job at Kindle files. I would suggest using Word or another processor, then invest in Jutoh, if you want to quickly and easily publish. Hope this helps. C. B.

Probably you have either Windows Vista or Windows DP. I just checked the WriteWay website and they say the WriteWay runs on the following Windows 32/64-bit versions Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 and Windows 8. You need to check which version of Windows you have. If it's Vista or XP, the website says it will work. Check for yourself at http://www.writewaypro.com/product_info.php. Hope this helps.

I write fiction. I might suggest writing your paper chapter by chapter, or section by section, whatever the case might be, and then export your finished work to word at as RTF file. That's how I edit my writing. I like WWP because it's easy to move around paragraphs and chapters. JTR"

The WRITE WAY PRO people sent me my license no and allowed me to redownload - since I couldn't find the one I had previously - THEY MAKE IT VERY EASY!
4901,yes/no,B005DM5QEK,Might this work for screenwriting...?,Y,I'm a huge fan of WriteWay but I've never use it to write (formatted draft) a screen play. I did use WriteWay to develop the story and outline a screen play just to have the fun of doing it. When I had the story figured out I used Fade In to write it and have it properly formatted. The combination of WriteWay and Fade In worked great. Both of them are affordable. Fade In is remarkably simple to use for writing a perfectly formatted play or script.

4922,yes/no,B005F387NY,will this work on the garmin 810?,?,Oh yeah. I have an 810. Works great. The turn by turn sometimes isn't all that but not a consequence of the added map. Probably a consequence of the device.
4923,yes/no,B005F387NY,Will this work on a 2015 Mercedes C300?,N,We would not make this recommendation.
4924,yes/no,B005F387NY,Does this work with Garmin N&Atilde;&frac14;vi 52LM ?,Y,Yes it will according to research on maps you can load in that Garmin.
4925,yes/no,B005F387NY,Can I use it in my car?,Y,Yes - you need to get the holder for the best results - it will work on its own.
4926,yes/no,B005F387NY,Will this work with Garmin GPS 62st?,?,"No guarantees, but the specs for your GPS show that it can accept Micro SD cards as well as city navigator maps, so it should work."
4927,yes/no,B005F387NY,is this a dvd that I can transfer from my laptop to my Nuvi 2595 that has European maps installed?,?,The version I got is a 4 GB Scan Disc micro-SD card that fits in the micro-drive slot on the Garmin 810. Bob
4928,open-ended,B005FCW42K,What is the difference between Avid Software Sibelius v.7 and Avid Sibelius 7 - Professional Edition?,,No difference; just different labeling.
4929,open-ended,B005FCW42K,What are the contents of the box - how many CD/DVDs and user manuals?,,"There are 3 discs. 1 Sibelius 7 installer/ program DVD an 2 content discs. There are quick start instructions but no physical reference manual. Digital reference guide is available in the program, you can print out the manual...780 pages or purchase the printed manual. Believe the Avid manual is available through Amazon. There are also tutorials available in the program."
4930,open-ended,B005FCW42K,I JUST BOUGHT THIS and I'm trying to load it on W8.1 ... error message says A DIGITALLY SIGNED DRIVER IS REQUIRED. WINDOWS BLOCKED THE INSTALLATION.,,"You may have already tried this, but on the Sibelius/Avid site, you can search the Knowledge Base, and there are various notices about Windows 8, including installation issues. Apparently it does work with Windows 8, but there is a recommendation to download an update before installing. I'm not sure what the issue you're having is, since my machine runs Windows 7. Good luck though; I hope you get through the installation. In my experience, it's the only really difficult part of this software. After that, it gets to be more fun."
4931,open-ended,B005FCW42K,Can you download or use this software on more than one computer?,,"This is answered at the Sibelius FAQ web page: http://www.sibelius.com/products/sibelius/faq/index.html#46 Q: Can I use Sibelius 7 on more than one computer? Yes, in these two cases: (i) you can install a single-user copy of Sibelius on two computers for your own use only; (ii) Site licenses are available for schools, colleges and universities. Apart from in these cases, you are not allowed to use Sibelius on more than one computer. Apparently the install DVDs come with both Mac OSX and Windows versions, if you use both platforms at home you should be good to go. When I rebuilt from scratch my Macbook Pro to a new OS, I don't recall having to unregister the original install in the old OS (Lion) order to reinstall in new OS (Mountain Lion). Your mileage may vary."
4932,yes/no,B005FCW42K,Does this item include the free upgrade to Sibelius 7.5 when it comes out?,?,I don't know. I've just barely started to work with it.
4933,yes/no,B005FDK7J6,Can you run Parallels 7 with the OS X version 10.8.5,Y,"Yes, that is the version I have."
4934,open-ended,B005FDK7J6,"do you need to buy windows too? If you buy Parallels Desktop, do you also have to buy Windows operating software to be able to run Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.?",,"Yes, unless you already have a legit copy of Windows installation disc; Parallels comes by itself."
4935,yes/no,B005FDK7J6,Can you run Parallels 7 on OS X 10.10.3?,N,I do not know. Go to the Parallels website they have a list of compatible operating systems.
4936,yes/no,B005FDK7J6,do you have to purchase a copy of windows with this?,?,Yes you do. There sadly isn't one included.
4937,open-ended,B005FDK7J6,If I install this can I play windows games like Skyrim and Halo?,,"I don't know those particular games. However, Parallels just lets you install a copy of the Windows operating system on your hard drive - parallel operating systems of Mac and Windows. Anything you can run on Windows on any brand computer, you can run on Windows on your Mac."
4938,yes/no,B005FDK7J6,can I use this with MacBook air.,Y,Yes. I used this software with my MacBook Pro.
4939,yes/no,B005FDK7J6,Does version 7 work with mavericks,?,I am using Parallels with iMac OS 10.9.2 and works very well. Go for it!
4940,open-ended,B005FDK7J6,What versions of Windows can I Run?,,I am running windows 7. I am not sure if this works with the newest versions. I am currently running 10.7.5 and it works fine. I have not upgraded due to other programs on my comp that have issues with latest updates. I am not sure on this with other versions of the OS.
4941,yes/no,B005FDK7J6,Is Parallels still giving out license keys?,?,Just buy version 9 and you will be able to run any windows and Mac version. They probably are but no reason to get this version if you have the latest Apple iOS or wanting windows 8.0 support.
4942,yes/no,B005FDK7J6,Will this run on Snow Leopard?,?,"I would think it would, since I'm running it on Mountain Lion. It will not run on Mavericks. Can always verify with Parallels."
4943,open-ended,B005FIWULY,Pro + Enhanced payroll does it includes subscription??? QuickBooks Pro 2012 W/QB Enhanced Payroll 2012 Can someone explain this package to me???,,"I have been buying this package for the last several years. Each year the ""renewal"" for the payroll service costs more than this package. What is in here: The newest version of Quickbooks and a one year subscription to the 3 employee of enhanced payroll. With some careful shopping, I beat the ""payroll renewal"" and keep my system up to date. If you have more than 3 employees on your active payroll (within one month) you can add payroll for 4+ employees at any time for usually (historical) $100.00 Less than a buck a day for the latest and payroll. QB 2012 alone is $200+."
4944,yes/no,B005FIWULY,If I am operating with QB 2011 can I just buy 2014 payroll or do I need the bundle. Would rather just purchase the payroll,Y,"Yes, you can buy just the basic payroll or the enhanced payroll separately from Amazon."
4945,yes/no,B005FIWULY,"Upgrading to unlimited employee version: If I have more than 3 employees, do I order this version and then call Intuit to upgrade to the payroll program for over 3 employees?",?,You can use the same product and upgrade payroll from within the program.
4946,open-ended,B005FIWULY,"if I already have an enhanced sub can i wait to activate this? If I purchase this, can I wait and activate it next November when my current sub expires, or is it only for a 1 year period starting from installation?",,"I'd like to know this as well, I wonder if it would stack the subscription. I just wish I had checked amazon for the update as opposed to buying through the 'discounted price' from intuit. I really dislike quickbooks these days. Once they snag you for the auto renewal for enhanced payroll, you simply can't get rid of them. I originally renewed on a CC, it automatically reupped the following year. That kinda peaved me a little. I called intuit and they claimed to remove this from my account. Next year it reupped again, on a CC that was no longer current. But yep, I got the bill from the CC company. How is this possible???"
4947,open-ended,B005FIWULY,Easy way to transfer quickbook files from one computer to another? What would be the easiest and safest way to transfer quickbook files from one computer to another?,,"MS Easy Transfer will move all data and docs from one computer to the other and can move items from XP to Win 7. It is pre-installed on Win 7 and a free download for XP. If all you want is to move the Quickbooks files, backup to a thumb drive (or any portable drive) on the old machine and then do a restore from that thumb drive on the new one."
4948,yes/no,B005FIWT6K,will it work on mac?,?,I'm sorry but I do not know. I use a windows system. I want to say that it should from memory but I cannot verify. Again my apologies!
4949,yes/no,B005FIWT6K,will this work in Microsoft 7 ???,Y,It worked on my Windows 7 system.
4950,yes/no,B005FIWT6K,will it work on mac?,Y,I have Windows 7 and I can't even get it to sync with my bank.
4951,yes/no,B005FIWT6K,will it work on mac?,?,Checked the box it came in and only Windows OS are listed. Sorry.
4952,open-ended,B005FIWUMS,Quickbooks 2012: Does Quickbooks 2012 do payroll as well?,,"It does not. You need to purchase an annual subscription which for more than 3 people costs you around $380 a year in addition to whatever your software costs. If that's not bad enough, after 3 years you will be FORCED to upgrade your Quickbooks software in order to continue to have the privilege of paying the annual subscription which by then will likely be $500 a year. There is an all manual mode buried in the software somewhere or it used to be...but good luck finding it and if you do use it, you can't print any forms. In the old old days, before Intuit turned evil, they would offer a one time free tax table download which in many cases was good for a few years...all you had to do was tweak the federal withholdings manually. Those days are long gone."
4953,open-ended,B005FIWUMS,Forced to buy 2012 software for invoices? Is this the only problem or am I going to lose my many years of invoices and not be able to continue using the program?,,"I've been using QB2012 profor the past 5 months and while it is true that they charge too much for ""enhanced payroll and other features,"" I found the service very helpful. I run payroll for 2 employees and the annual cost is over $300 bucks plus a $29 monthly fee. This is too much! But when it comes to Fed 941 and state's liabilities I don't have to worry and just process the liabilities via electronic filing. I also contacted their payroll customer service and they were very professional and helpful in answering my questions. I also posted a question on the Intuit blog and I got a response within a few hours. Every software company comes up with upgrades for their products and charges for them but I do agree that QB's upgrades are too expensive, specially after you have spent a considerable amount obtaining the software and paying for services. QB should care more a about its customers and provide upgrades and services at reasonable rates."

4955,open-ended,B005FIWUMS,2012 versus 2011: Why does the 2012 Quickbooks Pro cost less than the 2011 version?,,"Read the reviews on the 2012 vs. and I think you will see that the 2011 vs. may not have the issues that the newer vs. does. I have used QuickBooks Pro in the past, beginning in 2002 and the last year was 2008. I was very impressed with the ease of use and the ability to make corrections to posting without having to do journal entries, ie. just fix the posting. The payroll, when I was doing it came with the annual upgrade for free, so I upgraded annually. There was no limit on the number of employees, or if there was we never reached it. Our highest employee count was probably twenty. But having read the reviews for 2012 I am wondering if I want to install for my new start-up company. Maybe the 2011 for now and see what else is out there before we have employees."

4960,open-ended,B005FIWUMS,Can I sill use this version to do my basic booking be downloading my bank information? Why QB threat me that it will NOT work after this coming May?,,"Tax laws change, so the software must, too. I personally use an updated version so the integration to my bank and business stays current and within tax code."
4961,open-ended,B005FIWUMS,Quidkbooks Pro 2012: Is upgrading to 2012 any better?,,"Quickbooks Pro 2012 2011 can certainly look at 2009..what hogwash! If your accountant told you that, then get rid of them. They certainly are not that familiar with QuickBooks. In the Denver metro area at least, almost all small businesses use some form of QuickBooks. It is the best software for small businesses."

4963,yes/no,B005FIWTHO,can quicken 2012 be used on windows xp?,?,"Yes, but I am curious why you are interested in an older version of the program? DO NOT GET QUICKEN 2014 as its functionality is less than earlier versions. 12 may actually have been my fav. Attaching documents to my transactions is my issue. In earlier versions I could attach Checks or Invoices or Other. When I wanted to view an attachment I chose one of the 3 categories and picked my image. In 2014 there no longer seperate categories. You have to selec, then open, each individual image to find the one you need."
4964,open-ended,B005FIWTHO,which quicken is compatible with window 8?,,I can't answer that as I have windows 7. My quicken 2012 works well with Windows 7.
4965,open-ended,B005FIWTHO,Does QP 2012 still have the retirement planner? Does Quicken Premier 2012 still have the retirement planner?,,"Hi Laura, yes it does. Right mouse click at the top of Quicken where the icons are located and left mouse click the ""customize tollbar"" choice. Then look to the left of a new window and click ""Tax Planner"" and choose ""add"", then click the ""OK"" button. The retirement icon is now added and you may now click this icon to gain access to this planner."
4966,open-ended,B005FIWT74,Quicken vs. Microsoft Money: Does anyone else miss Microsoft Money?,,Yes. And I'm yet to find a replacement. Although I recently discovered that Microsoft offer the sunset version for free by download. I'm seriously considering using this. I actually purchased YNAB but it lacks so many features Money had.
4967,open-ended,B005FIWT74,Down Loading transactions to Quicken 2009: What kind of BS is this?,,There is a huge market for a financial management tool that works. It might take another year but there will soon be a replacement by a vendor that cares and will fix the issues that have made the Quicken and Turbo tax experience so painful.
4968,yes/no,B005FIWT74,Was just about to upgrade ... saving my $$$ Deceptive???,?,"I've been seriously considering upgrading Quicken for several years (I've been using v 2004), but every time I look at the Amazon reviews and read about the unfixed bugs, terrible support and general user dissatisfaction, I figure I'll wait til Intuit gets its act together. With 44% of users still being so dissatisfied, I'll keep waiting. Too bad, since I'd like to take advantage of the transaction downloads."

I had to set it up special in 2011. That means I had to find it in the menu, and set it up as my opening page on Quicken. Not the same way as the prior versions had it. Its hidden this time. I am sure 2012 is the same way. I would try the Quicken discussion page if you can not find it. Good luck"

How do I get it to work with windows 8?",,"Unfortunately I have no knowledge of Windows 8, as my computers use either Windows 7, XP or Vista and my software is Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2012. However, I have occasionally successfully emailed copies of my cards which are automatically put into the AVI format for email purposes. An AVI file is an Audio Video Interleave file used by video players and Microsoft Media Players. If I email a card, I firstly always send a copy to myself so that I can make sure its ok. It appears in the email as an AVI attachment and when I double click it, in my case it plays it in my media player. The first page comes into view after a few seconds, which then fades out to reveal the subsequent pages, one by one. I hope this helps. Angela"

I had used the older version for a few years on my PC so when I switched to Mac a year ago I ordered the mac version and it did not work. You would think someone would test all phases of a program before they put it on the market. I returned it and did buy the PC version since I have Parallels on my iMac and can run PC programs. but I'd rather have the Mac version and just get away from the PC. Hope I was some help to you."

One thing I did not like was you could not delete the Hallmark information/logos. When I make a card I don't want people knowing I was using a stencil. I had been using a card maker program that is no longer available and it was easy to use."

4977,open-ended,B005FNVINU,how do i change my email address on my email a card,,"Hi Chrissy I am not exactly sure what you mean. Do you mean that you have more than one way of emailing, for instance Hot Mail or Yahoo and you wish to change it from the default email address? I only have one Virgin Media email account so when I click on ""email"" within the Hallmark program, it automatically takes me into a new message in Windows Live Mail (my operating system is Windows 7) so I put in my recipient's address and then send it on its way via my Virgin Media email provider. On the other hand, when it first goes through into your default email, instead of ""sending"" it, you could ""save"" it to ""My Documents"" and then go into whichever email account you wish to send it from and add it as an attachment from ""My Documents"". I have just tried saving it and you can then attach it to any email. I hope this information helps. Angela"

The easiest way to do it (I did it) is using your school's email address, ie. tiara_still_fly@yourschool.edu. They want to see an edu ending. They will send you your activation key through that email. You can also fax/email your school ID card and they will send you the activation key the same way you sent your ID."

They have different part numbers",,"Thank you for your question. The software itself is exactly the same, and sells for the same or close to the same price. The only difference is that the student edition includes 4 years of free upgrades. AVID is fairly strict about verification, so you definitely need to provide verification that you are a student or teacher to qualify for either of these two academic editions. I hope this information is helpful. - Arnie Schachere, Music Studio Direct Amazon Store"
4982,yes/no,B005FV8S4O,"Is this identical to the Sibelius 7 Academic product offered on the Avid website for $295, including all packaging and documentation? thanks!",Y,"Yes it is the full box product, but you have to have an educational email account in order to use this.

4986,open-ended,B005FV8S4O,how Amazon will activate the SW purchased after its receival? because Avid says thay prove of elegibility needed. What if they dont accept it as valid,,"I've ordered this product from them twice and both times they insisted on eligibility documentation. I understand that they want to verify academic credentials but they need a smoother, more professional way of doing it. And they need to keep on record, past purchases where credentials were already submitted and approved. When I order things on-line, I expect a minimum of required contact with the vendor after the order is placed. I want to place the order and move on. No phone or further email contact required."
4987,yes/no,B005FV8SGC,Can you upgrade from sebilius first?,Y,"There is a discounted price for those moving from Sibelius First to Sibelius 7, but it isn't exactly an upgrade as the core software is different."

Why would my sound card not function in this mode?,,I had to go to the hidden icons button on the task bar and right click on the volume speaker and open the Volume Mixer and unmute Honestech Audio Recorder and now I have sound. It took about an hour to figure this out. Troubleshooting support is really lacking. Hope this solution helps someone else out.
4993,open-ended,B005GI1AY6,"Specs say that system reqs are Windows 7, Vista, etc. Does anyone know whether it will work with a Mac OS?",,"Sorry, It only works with Windows"
4994,open-ended,B005GI1AY6,Does anyone know if this works for reel to reel players?,,"I have a reel-to-reel, and would guess not. The Honestech folks send you a cassette player that will connect with your PC (where the Honestech program is loaded), so if you can find an adapter to jack your reel-to-reel tape deck into your PC, then it would probably work. The old jacks I have are not designed to connect to anything other than an amplifier."
4995,yes/no,B005GI1AY6,Does it work with Mac?,Y,I don't know about that. I plugged it into my pc and used it once. That's all it gave me.

I have never had that problem, but have had many other problems with this program. It maybe your printer settings but I wouldn't be surprised if it is the program itself. I have used the older versions of Printmaster for many years and was very happy with it but since I changed my computer I had to buy one for windows7 and it is the worst I ever had! What a waste of money. Nothing prints out right and it has a very limited selection for cards etc. I would see if it can be returned for something else."

5002,open-ended,B005GISNUU,why can't I print a half fold greeting card correctly?,,"You probably need to let your printer ""Learn"" the way it works. And if not, do a test print and see which way to put the paper back in... OR print on two pieces and glue the inside one to the middle of the fold."
5003,open-ended,B005GISNUU,Reimbursement or New software: Have any of you gotten any replacement software or help from Broderbund as it relates to this?,,I have requested a refund just two hours after purchasing this software ....we'll see what happens.
5004,yes/no,B005GISNLY,does it work with windows 8?,?,"James, I believe that Encore's The Print Shop is the biggest piece of garbage ever issued. It was almost totally unusable, and could not do any of the tasks that the earlier versions did so easily. We returned it, and kept the old computer and printer to run it and keep my wife sane. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!! It doesn't work well with ANY system."
5005,open-ended,B005GISNLY,"if you have a choice of print shop for window 8.1, which print shop should i buy?",,Since I really dislike the printshop 3.0 I haven't really looked into buying another version. The old version I had (I think it was 6.0 but back in the 90's and it was GREAT but not compatible with my newer computer). 3.0 is a big waste of money as you can see from the reviews.
5006,open-ended,B005GISNLY,where is the crop function in The Print Shop deluxe,,"There is none. I use Google Picasa to crop all photos. Very unhappy with this product. Also, if you do ""landscape"" you have to save in jpeg form to print. Another headache, you can't customize font size between sizes given I.e. 48 to 72, nothing in between."
5007,yes/no,B005GISNLY,"What software, that is easy to use, would you advise for Windows 7 and 64 bit OS??",?,its not worth the money. it won't load properly a total waste of money

5012,yes/no,B005GW83H4,"Does it have Engravers, preferably Engravers MT?",?,"I believe it does. I installed the fonts, but can't say for sure if Engravers MT was a part of that, or on my machine already. Sorry - that's probably not much help!"

5014,open-ended,B005GW83H4,where can I see a list of included fonts before I buy,,I don't think there's a complete list available....not sure....it's been a long time since I purchased. Sorry. I guess you could try the vendor's website. Best I can do.......
5015,yes/no,B005GW83H4,Will this download work for Windows 8?,Y,It will download but the software didnot add the fonts to the group of fonts that came with MS Office.
5016,yes/no,B005GW83H4,Does this product include the type of script used for baseball team logos such as Brooklyn Dodgers?,?,"Hard to tell.....you can get close with some, but I doubt you could cover all of MLB teams. I believe that all team logos are copyright protected."
5017,yes/no,B005GW83H4,Does this product have a font that looks like chalk -- ie. writing on a blackboard?,N,No. This is a boring font package. I wanted bulk fonts on my computer so I got this. its Not bad just not wow.

5027,yes/no,B005HTIWIQ,Will this software allow me to add music to my photo slide show???,?,"This is something that I do not use PSP for. If I am going to add music to a photo slide show, I prefer to use a non-linear editing program that is meant for that such as Sony's Vegas Movie Studio, or Corel's Video Studio Pro or even Adobe Premeire. This is mostly a photo editing program, and while adding music might be a possibility, I confess I have not done it with this because in my view there is not enough control."
5028,open-ended,B005HTIWIQ,Does this software work well for digital background editing? Like adding a digital background when taking photos against a white/green screen?,,"I never tried to do that, but this software will allow you to change background, colors, etc. It is very similar to PhotoShop."
5029,yes/no,B005HTIWIQ,Could I dowload paint shop Corel to my 2 pc's ?,?,"PaintShop Pro X4 is no longer on the Corel web site but PainShop Pro X5 is available. From experience with purchasing downloads from other Software providers I can tell you that you would prefer to purchase it on-line but receive it in the mail, two reasons: 1) Downloads can drop data which causes issues, and 2) It's nice to have the disc just in case something ""burp's"" within the software that causes an issue."
5030,open-ended,B005HTIWIQ,waterslide decals: Does this program have that?,,Yes. See the video and see for yourself. It's interesting. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ne8tcRWkW4

5032,open-ended,B005HTIWF4,Why won't it play some movies,,what kind? And it has a new update: WinDVD_11.6_Pro.exe Depends what region you are.
5033,yes/no,B005HTIWF4,Does this software play HD DVDs,Y,"Yes it does, but so does VLC and it's free."
5034,yes/no,B005HTIWF4,Will this play commercial blu ray movies?,?,"I never got it to play anything on blu ray. Tech Support was somewhat responsive, but clueless to resolve the issue. I gave up on the product."
5035,yes/no,B005HTIWF4,is it worth the money?,Y,"Since I was unable to run it while using 2 monitors in my workspace, I would say no. Their tech support even stated that I had to have one monitor to get it to work. If you have a laptop, then it should work. But after suffering through that headache, I purchased Cyberlink PowerDVD 14 Ultra instead: and it works great: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JOVFT0W/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o02_?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
5036,open-ended,B005HTIWF4,"My Corel WinDVD Pro 11 is not working with my Office 365 on Windows 8.1, why?",,Because this program just straight up doesn't work. I am serious. I got it to work for me about 5% of the time before I returned it.
5037,open-ended,B005HTIWF4,how well does the upconverting of DVDs work--- and how does the video image compare with VLC,,it does a great job I am running it through a standard 1080 I flat screen and still get good 3-d graphics all in all I would say this program exceeds what I thought I would get.
5038,open-ended,B005HTIWF4,easy use,,very easy to use.. though I thought it plays blue ray.. it does it very nice for normal dvds
5039,yes/no,B005HTIWF4,Does this work with windows 8?,?,Unknown. But Pro 13 is designed for Win8
5040,yes/no,B005HTIWF4,Does this convert video formats? I am looking for the best and CHEAPEST software for PC to convert to WMV,?,Don't know. I just use it to play BluRay and DVDs.
5041,open-ended,B005HTIWF4,easy to use,,"fairy easy but don't expect to use the same license you installed on win7 to work on win8, that happened to me and they wouldn't allow me to activate it on the PC I upgrades 6 weeks after I bought it."
5042,open-ended,B005HTIWW2,genealogy: Is there a way to download all my information from Family Tree Maker 2009 to other software?,,GEDCOM - Export your data to a GEDCOM file then import it into your new genealogy program. Look under the File tab for Export - then follow the directions.
5043,yes/no,B005HTIWW2,Is it possible to import .FTW or similar tree file from Family Tree Maker 2006 into this program?,N,I have not been able to download this program at all.
5044,yes/no,B005HTIWW2,Can this be used with Windows 8?,?,"I run it on Win 7 and have no problems and even though I haven't tried it on Win 8 yet. I do have a Win 8 computer and so far have not found anything that will run on 7 that won't run on 8. Sorry, but I will try it now to see for myself."
5045,open-ended,B005HTIWW2,How can my Family Tree Heritage be transferred to my cousin's Family Tree Heritage? I have all the information.,,"It seems that the best way is to copy your database file and use the ""Merge"" under the ""Tools"" menu to add in the files that are not in their own database. It should also update any information they have that you do not."
5046,yes/no,B005HTIWJ0,Can you burn a DVD or blue Ray after copying files from this software. Does it include a quality burner program?,Y,"My experience is limited and I do not have any experience with software other than Corel. I have used the DVD burner to create DVDs that will work on a DVD player. It seems to work OK. The picture quality was not as good as I get when I just save the data to my computer and watch it from there. However, I needed to burn some wedding videos for the bride and groom that they could watch on a TV. They seemed very happy with the videos. Overall I am very satisfied with this software."
5047,open-ended,B005HTIWJ0,1080?,,What are you asking?
5048,yes/no,B005HTIWJ0,Will Corel VSPX4 allow me to import/edit .MTS files?,?,"Yes. You will also be able to export your HD video to DVD media using AVCHD format. The files can be played directly on to your Blu-ray player. Or, you can export to DVD, but the files will not be HD, because DVD players do not support HD. There are other export choices as well, but I find that putting HD video directly into a Blu-Ray readable format is convenient."
5049,yes/no,B005IHW242,Is this software good to write a business plan for a Hotel construction and also for a non-profit organization?,?,The software is a canned software. I have found it to be useful but you must know accounting and you must know about the companies goals for a business plan.
5050,yes/no,B005IHW242,Would this be helpful for writing a business plan for an internet startup seeking venture capitalists?,?,"Absolutely not. This program is buggy and hard to use. If you want a cookie-cutter business plan, this is for you though. You would really have to have growth potential for venture capitalists to even take notice of you. You are much better off doing lots of research by looking at other business plans than buying this. This does not provide the detail you would need for something like that. If you're starting an internet start up, you had better learn to code and show people how something works, not just theory. Additionally, by writing your own business plan after thorough research you will know your company that much better and be able to pitch it with greater success."
5051,open-ended,B005IHW242,download or ship?,,"Download, get it faster and can begin using it. You can always burn the executable to a cd"
5052,yes/no,B005IHW242,Is it compatible with windows 8?,Y,"Yes. I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8/8.1 two weeks ago, and had not attempted to open the software since then. Thank you for asking this, because I learned that I had to re-download the product (for free through my Amazon account). I opened the program, and checked most of the features. Everything worked fine in Windows 8.1. A word of warning to anyone who might transition from XP/Vista/7 to 8: upgrade to Windows 8 before creating business plans using the software. I believe I temporarily lost 2 business plans (I have it all backed up somewhere, I just have to find a computer with which to open the full backup)."
5053,yes/no,B005IHW242,"Can your collaborate with multiple people online, sharing file etc.??",N,"Not with this version no, but the company's website does offer a new online version that allows you to do exactly that. From what I've heard it's actually a really great product."
5054,yes/no,B005IHW242,is this software compatible with OS X yosimite for Mac,?,"No. But if you have windows installed on your MAC, you can run it from there. On my Airbook, I have windows separately installed as an operating system, so I am able to log in and use this program from there."
5055,yes/no,B005IHW242,Does this Business plan Software have an Dutch language option?,?,"I looked in the software for language options...I could not find any...I asked the company and they have not responded...I know Windows has language options, but I don't know if you can do it with this software...or if you can do the plan in English and translate it...sorry"
5056,yes/no,B005IHW242,I am trying to make a business plan for a Dog Grooming Salon. Is this software a good tool to do that ?,?,I purchased this software and was highly disappointed with it. It is only a sample of a business plan. If you need other documents you have to purchase them through a third party. If you csn buy it for less than $8 then it may be worth it. Otherwise I would suggest formswift 7 day trial for $7.95 . Thats where I ended up getting mine done. Ir turned out wonderful.
5057,open-ended,B005IHW242,"Starting a B&amp;B from the ground up, new green construction, and need to ask for loans and grants is this software a good product for my needs?",,"I'm working on a start-up, too. I find the software very intuitive and easy to use. Plus, it helps paint an accurate picture for potential investors to see your cost and revenue projections."
5058,yes/no,B005IHW242,Is this software compatible with Windows 8?,Y,Yes it is. That is what I have
5059,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,Does printmaster 18.1 work on windows 8,Y,"Yes. it certainly does. When my computer crashed and I had to replace it with Windows 8, I was not happy. Not just having lost everything, but because Windows 8 was quite different from my Windows XP. However, Printmaster 18.1 is basically the old familiar Printmaster I've loved over the years, but with some upgrades (more functions possible). I've had no problem using Printmaster 18 with my Windows 8."
5060,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,can you make collages,Y,"yes, I believe you can make a collage with PM 18.1. You can copy a variety of images, pictures, etc., and paste them on a MP poster or blank page. I think this program is exceptionally versitile, but I have been using PM for years. Once you get familiarized with this program, I think you will love it. I certainly do!"
5061,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,"Can I use it to design Business Cards, and are there lots of Avery Business Card Options? Thanks!",Y,"Yes, you can design all sorts and sizes of business cards. You can buy the matching sheets of business card paper. Coordinate all of this with the printer and you should have good results."
5062,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,can it make water proof laser labels for jars and bottles?,?,"It makes tons of different kinds of labels. I haven't tried them yet, but there's a laser ""Avery White WeatherProof Address Label"" as well as some Weatherproof Shipping Labels that are available, plus a wide assortment of other label sizes. It also does full-sheet labels. Hope that helps!"
5063,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,"I need to produce a really nice looking brochure for work and haven't used this product for yrs have Windows 7 and a great printer, is it good?",?,It's the best of the Printmaster series. Tried the Platinum and didn't like it but I can do anything with this one. You can make an awesome brochure with this program.
5064,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,Does Printmaster 18.1 work on Windows 8.1. No one seems to agree on whether or not it works. Please only answer if you are running Windows 8.1.,?,"I am running Windows 8.1. I used Printmaster to make invitations, place cards, and to address envelopes for a wedding reception. It worked very well, even though it did lock up a few times, causing me to have to restart my computer. So, not perfect, but workable."
5065,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,Can I use software to make t-shirt transfers.,Y,Yes. The issue is whether your printer will accept the transfer paper.
5066,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,"Does printmaster 18.1 print in reverse for iron on transfers to bags, t-shirts, banners?",?,"Yes,,just the prior progams."
5067,yes/no,B005IIUFYU,will this program make labels for wine bottles and canning labels,Y,"Yes, it will make great labels."
5068,open-ended,B005IIUFYU,"How do you mirror images left to right? Also, how do you make the text have shading (used to be called drop down text)?",,Not sure about the mirror images- but the shading is done by selecting the font format that looks like a letter with shading- you can then pick the color of the letter and the shading
5069,yes/no,B005JRGV3Y,will this run on 64bit OS Winows 7 ??,Y,"Yes It will, Runs fine on my laptop w/ win 7"
5070,open-ended,B005JRGV3Y,"does this program have ""air brushing"" ? A feature that can air brush out double chins and fat hips ?",,"PhotoPlus Serif do not have the air brush or air spray brush, but Serif DrawPlus x 5 does, the spray brush and corel painshop pro x 4 or even x 2 include the air brush, that you can use to do anything you like, changing features in face or body, adding sun tan, color, skin tones or shapes, adding make up or deleting, depending of what pictures are you working with. Both program I own and both are great programs."
5071,yes/no,B005JRGV3Y,"Does this program do ""batch editing"" of multiple photos?",Y,yes. It is better that the adobe product photoshop
5072,yes/no,B005JRGV3Y,"Has anyone found solution to the ""insufficient memory"" when working with large size images without having to downsize? (16Gb RAM here)",N,no longer use this it has given me nothing but problems and I think its a European version to begin withdo yourself a favor and get another program just not that one
5073,yes/no,B005LRM50K,can this system be used with a mac,?,"There is a special version of Dragon Medical that is exclusive for the Mac computer. We sell it on the KnowBrainer dot com website but I do not recommend it. DMPE can only be used on a Windows PC or a Mac computer running Windows in Parallels or boot camp. PS: if you are looking to purchase DMPE, you'll get a better deal by going directly to our website where we can offer you lifetime support and complementary training"
5074,open-ended,B005LRM50K,"I am looking for medical practice edition 1 specifically, not 2. Is this medical practice edition, or medical practice edition 2?",,Nuance licensed/certified resellers (which are the only people who can legally sell you Dragon Medical or support you because Nuance doesn't offer any support for Dragon Medical) can only sell you DMPE 2 (2nd edition). I can imagine why you would want the 1st edition which is full of bugs and numerous complaints but I'll certainly be glad to answer any questions you may have. You can also reach me directly at (615) 884-4558 x1. There are no legal copies of the 1st edition of Dragon Medical because Nuance certified resellers are required to return old software to Nuance.

5076,yes/no,B005LRM50K,"I want to use Dragon 10 or 11 for MT work from home.will not be using it for EMR, just transcribing from dictation,which one will be best?",?,"Hello, I""m currently using version 11 and from what Dragon Support team told me that version 11 has much more enhanced medical library, accent recognition etc. I would say version 11 is a safer bet.

Mac installable?,,"I've only installed it on PC, but it came with a separate Mac disc - and the box says it works with MacOS X 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7."
5080,yes/no,B005LXONE0,Will it work with Windows 8.1?,N,"No , 10 is though but only because of pressure 14 is the only other to fully support 8.1"

""The latest versions Kaspersky Internet Security and Kaspersky Anti-Virus (both 13.0.1.4190) fully support Windows 8. The latest version of Kaspersky PURE (12.0.2.733) partially supports Windows 8.

5082,yes/no,B005MLOROM,Is this the 2013 version of Kaspersky One?,Y,Yes it is since it's a download. If your were to not download until later in the year you could download the 2014 edition.

Depending on which OS you are using (Android, Windows, or Mac) all installations will be different. For Windows, using a KIS 2013 trial for 30 days and then activating it with the license key will extend your service by 30 days, so long as you activate it with the key the first time. Anytime you activate it on ANY device, all the 5 licenses dates start from there."
5084,yes/no,B005MLOROM,can u send me the serial only ? .. I don't want the box,?,Sorry - when you purchase Kaspersky One - or any other program - you get a serial number. Guess you will have to purchase Kaspersky One.

The only thing I can't seem to do is get my raw files (pics) to load directly from the organizer into the raw software instead directly into the editor. Therefor, I can't edit in raw. This copy of PSE 10 was downloaded from Adobe."
5093,open-ended,B005MMMT6E,Download vs. mailed to me,,"Easier reinstalls when a machine replacement (planned or unplanned) is needed. My most recent case was unplanned after a machine crashed, but previous years it was planned."

Can I use this version (10) that I already own on a second (new) laptop that I have just ordered, or will I have to repurchase?",,"You should be able to use it on the new laptop. Do you have a hard copy of your version 10 and the License Code? If so, then just install it from your disk and enter the License Code when asked. If not, you can clone from one laptop to the other (e.g. using Casper), but I would likely check with Adobe support on the best way to accomplish your needs if you installed from a download."
5095,open-ended,B005MMMT6E,RAW Format: Can I edit RAW images with my new Nikon D300S with Elements 10?,,"For the D300S you need Camera Raw v5.5 or above. PSE 8 shipped with 5.5, so PSE versions 8 and above should handle your NEF raws."

Will upgrading cure this?",?,"I have never used version 7 so am not aware of exactly what the issue is. I have not had any issues with the appearance of lettering in Elements 10. Besides, the newer features of v9, v10, etc. make upgrading worthwhile, I suggest."
5097,yes/no,B005MMMT6E,can photoshop elements resize pictures,Y,"YES... you can resize any and all pictures. I go to YouTube and search how to do things on PhotoShop Elements. In the YouTube search type ""Photoshop elements 10 resize"" you will find many videos to walk you through and more!"

5099,yes/no,B005MMMT6E,"Is it possible to put two different photos together into one? I know I can open one and it becomes the background, but is it possible to open anothe",?,"If someone is missing from the photo, or you have two photos where not everything is right, you can put the two together. It would require selecting the part you want from one and moving it into the other. I taught this as a fun project in my Computer Art class where the student would have their picture taken and then insert it into a famous place from Art History. (Like climbing the pyramid in Egypt). We used the full version of PhotoShop, but I have a friend who does it with Elements all the time. Just do a file&gt;open for each photo and go from there. I would have to research the directions for Elements but I know it can be done."
5100,open-ended,B005MMMT6E,"I have elements 10 which worked fine for Nikon D90 NEF files, presently purchased D7100 &amp; elements 10 says there is something wrong with file.",,"I'm no digital geek, but try a different memory card, or maybe a different kind of card reader. I had the same thing happen to me with a Nikon D300, and once I switched the card, it was all right. Worth a try, anyway. BruceS"
5101,open-ended,B005MMMT0A,Photoshop Elements 10 - OS Lion: Will Photoshop Elements 10 work with Mac OS X Lion?,,Yes it will. https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-premiere-elements/tech-specs.html
5102,open-ended,B005MMMT0A,Two questions.Is Elements 10 and easier to use for the non- professional beginner than Elements 12? Wich version is necessary for Windows 8 and 8.1?,,"I'm not sure either is ""easier to use."" Photoshop of any version requires a long and steep learning curve just to do basic stuff. If you have any photo background, you'll be a step ahead but you'll have to ""learn your way around"" the interface. Once you get comfortable with the basics, you can work magic with your photos. Their ""help"" helps a little bit. This website has some pretty good tutorials, although it now teaches the later versions (Creative Suite which comes after Elements 12): www.photoshopessentials.com. As to Windows 8, I doubt v10 will run on that platform - do not know about v12. I run Windows 7 Pro and v12 runs fine on that, v10 was a bit cranky which is why I moved to 12."
5103,open-ended,B005MMMT0A,why am I not able to use new Nikon D7100 with elements 10 worked fine with Nikon D90,,"I believe that this was published by the Adobe folks... Support for the D7100 was added after Photoshop Elements 11 was already out, at which point we stopped releasing updates for Photoshop Elements 10. If you would like native support for the D7100 (file opens directly into the appication) you would need Elements 11. Otherwise, you can use the DNG converter to change the files from NEF to DNG and then they will open in Elements 10."
5104,open-ended,B005MMMT0A,Full or Upgrade Version: Is the full or upgrade version since there is nothing to confirm either in the product description?,,I have the same question. What is the answer. Is it a full or upgrade version???
5105,open-ended,B005MMMT0A,Canon movies: Anyone know?,,"I have a Canon Rebel Ti 1 and use premier elements 9 for editing the videos. It does a fine job. What I have a problem with is copying onto a DVD. I followed their suggestion of ""burning"" to a folder, then doing the DVD. That worked. A Roxio program does a better job of burning the saved folder to DVD, though."
5106,open-ended,B005MMMT0K,Why Upgrade? Buy New for Less: Why pay for the upgrade when you can buy a new copy of PE 10 right here on Amazon for less $?,,"Yes, this confuses me too. I have PS Elements 3 which, from another question, I understand is acceptable if I want to upgrade to Elements 10, but why do so if I can purchase a fresh install for much less?"
5107,open-ended,B005MMMT0K,"upgrade from what? Will the upgrade work, or does it only work for 9?",,I have PS Elements 5 . . . is that too old to upgrade to 10?
5108,open-ended,B005MMMT0K,"how many installs? Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 Upgrade I have 3 computers that I want to load this on, does anyone know how many times this can be installed?",,"According to the Adobe website, it can be installed on two computers. Additional licenses can be purchased."
5109,yes/no,B005MQKDPE,will this work on Windows 8 as well as Windows 7?,?,"I only have a Microsoft Tablet running Windows 8; I could not get it installed, so I can't say if it will work on regular computer, but it will not run on my tablet"
5110,yes/no,B005MQKDPE,IS HOME INVENTORY PRO 2011 COMPATABLE WITH WINDOWS 8.1,?,"Yes, that is the OS I am using and have not had a single issue."
5111,open-ended,B005MQKDPE,"It says file import and export, what type of files can it import? EXCEL maybe?",,"I have not yet imported any files as of yet, but I have exported files to Excel. Hope this helps. There is very little documentation that comes with this, so everything for me has been trial and error. Of the two inventory systems that I tried, I liked this one the best."
5112,open-ended,B005MQKDPE,Which is better- Home Inventory Pro 2011 vs HomeManage Inventory,,"I used to use HomeManage until it stopped working and their tech support would not respond. I had input almost everything we own and did not want to start over from scratch as I couldn't import my data from HomeManage into Home Inventory. It went easier than I thought as I had HomeManage in Excel format. Not easy but doable. I found out there was legal action against the company through BBB of Canada. That didn't help me it turned out. So I bought Home Inventory Pro 2011 and find that I really like it. Funny thing, last week I got an email from HomeMange to upgrade and I was wondering if they are under new management. I won't go back though. I'm happy with what I have."
5113,yes/no,B005MQKDPE,Is this product compatible with Windows 7,Y,Yes. this works with windows 7....
5114,yes/no,B005MQKDPE,does it work on windows8,Y,"Yes it does. I installed it on my Win8 machine, which I have since upgraded to 8.1. Worked in both cases."
5115,yes/no,B005MQKDPE,I own a regular document scanner of good quality. Is there a benefit in purchasing a scanner designed with an option to scan receipts?,Y,I have an HP Photosmart 3210xi All-in-one and it handles scanning all of the documents I use with Home Inventory Pro. I also use Nuance PDF COnverter Professional as a software interface to scan in my inventory documents. I didn't see a need to get a separate scanner just to handle receipts. Hope this helps.
5116,open-ended,B005MQKDPE,anyone have a better software package than this?,,"SAP has inventory and production control for industry. Otherwise, for home use, this will be more than you need."
5117,yes/no,B005MQKDPE,does it work on win 8?,Y,"Yes, I've had no problem with my 8 laptop as it's basically just a string of ascii."
5118,yes/no,B005MQKDPE,i am starting a home inventory business. would this software be good for seperating multiple accounts with its own contents inside for each client,Y,"I only use it personally so I don't know about multiple accounts. In my opinion, it is a great program."

5129,yes/no,B005N2CSLY,Can you copy a tree to CD with images?,?,"You can create a ""book"" which would take some effort but it does allow you to add images. The book can then be saved as a pdf. You can export trees as Family Treemaker files with images/media, but the user would have to have FTM to open them. GEDCOM files, a universal file system, do not support images."
5130,open-ended,B005N2CSLY,"Can you transfer your whole Ancestry.com tree (and/or specific entries) into a Family Tree Maker program, or only the reverse?",,"Yes, you can transfer all of your ancestry.com research onto the Family Tree Maker - pictures, notes and all."
5131,open-ended,B005N2CSLY,Does anyone know the difference between this version and the newest 2014 version that just came out?,,Not much of a difference - you can still pretty much do the same things with both (books and all) and can still sync to ancestry.
5132,yes/no,B005N2CSLY,Will Family Tree Maker Platinum 2013 work with Windows 7?,?,I have Windows 7 and it's working fine for me.
5133,yes/no,B005N2CSLY,"Are you having problems with the display? Mine is too large in places, teeny in others.",Y,"Don't exactly understand what you mean by the word ""display"". If you mean the grid with all the relatives and generations past, you sometimes have to drag it up or over to make everything seen."
5134,open-ended,B005N2CSLY,Comparison of FTM Deluxe and Platinum?,,The additional cost is offset by 6 months of free membership which is also good as a credit toward your current active subscription/. It includes a good FTM manual that would cost extra. There is an additional CD to give to a friend but that would require full membership dues.
5135,yes/no,B005N2CSLY,I have some very old files/pre 2007/FBC.FTW. Will I be able to load this onto this software and see all my info such as pics Ive saved and such?,?,As long as your files are not from the original Family Tree maker you should be alright. The only thing is is that you can not go back to the older version of FTM unless you make a copy. Also it is recommended that you use the backup file if you have lots of pictures and documents because a GED does not save them but will reference them as a source.
5136,open-ended,B005N2CSLY,How do you access the ancestry.com membership that is supposed to be included in this?,,"If you were luck and received all 3 cd's then just go to help inside family tree maker and click on ""Activate Ancestry Subscription"""
5137,open-ended,B005N2CSLY,Can the free 6 months be added to a current paid account? Will the free 6 months be added to my current account?,,it says that you can on Ancestry.com
5138,yes/no,B005N2CSLY,Does the gift disc work on a Mac computer?,?,"No, the gift disc is formatted for a pc. However, it would probably work if you have Parallels installed on the Mac."
5139,yes/no,B005N2CS8M,"I have Family Tree Maker by broderbund, version 8. I need to upgrade. Can I upgrade to FTM 2012 by Nova?",?,You shouldn't have any problem. I have used FTM for years and generally upgrade about every two versions. It is generally seamless. I am using FTM12 now and had no problem upgrading.
5140,yes/no,B005N2CS8M,Is Family Tree Maker Deluxe 2012 the same as Family Tree Maker 2012 Complete?,?,"The Nova Development manufactures and sells Family Tree Maker Deluxe 2012 and they have 3 related products. Essentials, Deluxe, and Platinum. They do not have a Complete so I'm not sure what that is. The difference in the three products has nothing to do with the FTM 2012 itself, it is the same in all three. The differences lie in the extras that are included. For example with Essentials you get a 1 month free membership to Ancestry.com, with Deluxe it is 3 mo and with Platinum it is 6 mo. There are other extras as well. I realize this doesn't really answer your question, but I hope it helps."
5141,yes/no,B005N2CS8M,"Another ancestry.com question... Is it possible to extend a current subscription to ancestry.com with the ""free trial"" included?",Y,"Yes. It took a week or so to show up on my account page, but my last purchase of FTW included 30 days free and it was added on to the length of my current subscription."
5142,yes/no,B005N2CS8M,Is Family Tree Maker Deluxe 2012 compatible with Windows 8?,Y,"Yes, it is. I was leery about buying it with my Windows 8 computer but it works just fine."
5143,open-ended,B005N2CS8M,"I cannot open my older version of Family Tree Maker, if I buy will I be able to open it on windows 8?",,"hello Pat, I purchased Family Tree Maker Deluxe and I love it. It is compatible with WindowsXP which I use and also with Vista and Windows 7 and 8 . I hope this helps in your decision. Good Luck, Pat Burdick"
5144,open-ended,B005N2CS8M,"What does Family Tree Maker Deluxe [Old Version] mean? Is there a new version which has some significant difference from the old version? If so, what is that difference?",,"the Old version has no tie ins with ancestry.com.IOt also ahs a better entry page than the""newer' Versions(which tie in with ancestry.com and is now up to version 2014. The site ancestry.com contains numerous wrong items. They claim you will see a leaf and it brings up information on the highlighted person. I tried the newer version and the ""leaf"" information had no relation to the person . Example: I could be looking for George Washington (The first president) of Virginia and it gives me a George Washington Married to ""Sue Smith"" . We all know President Washington was married to Martha. Many consumer watchdog sites say thee same thing.The site ancestry.com amy shoe relevant info but insist you subscribe to actually see the info. Recently they had a free trial and I did try the free access and all people I searched brought no correct information."
5145,open-ended,B005N2CS8M,"If I pull pictures, etc from Ancestry.com to Family Tree Maker and later cancel ancestry.com, will my pictures still be viewable or only the links?",,"Your pictures should still be there in Family Tree Maker even if you cancel Ancestry. To make sure, I would download them to a flash drive or somewhere else on your computer and that way you would have them for sure. I always put my Family Tree Maker onto a flash drive and that way if something happens with my computer I have all of my information still in tact. It is always good to have a back up on Family Tree Maker for all of the work that we put into it. I teach Researching Family History and use Family Tree Maker and always tell my classes to back up your information."
5146,open-ended,B005N2CS8M,I am currently using Family Tree Maker 8.0 by Banner Blue. Which version should I buy which will allow me to upgrade my existing data base?,,I never heard of the program you have but family tree maker 2012 gives you acess to ancestry.com and it allows you to search their data base for info you may not have. I truely like this program. I hope this was helpful.
5147,yes/no,B005N2CS8M,Will this work with Mac?,Y,"There is a mac version, looks like amazon has it for $99.99"
5148,yes/no,B005N2CS8M,I have data on FTN v 2011. can I import that data directly to FTM v 2012,?,Follow these steps. First back up your FTN data. Next open FTM v 2012 and select import. Search for the FTN data which could be Hack.ftn (the name of the family tree or similar.) Ignore the screen about back up first since you already backed up your FTN data.
5149,yes/no,B005N2CS00,is it for imac?,?,This particular version is only for a Window PC. But there is a version for Mac: http://www.ancestry.com/cs/apps/P-4949
5150,yes/no,B005N2CS00,"Had older version of FTM, changed computers, files won't open with this version. Any thoughts on why?",?,"Had to change them to a gedcom file then they would open but the new files are totally different! Not impressed with the new software, but the old version wouldn't open on my new computer, go figure.."
5151,yes/no,B005N2CS00,Is Family Tree Maker 2014 any easier to use? I want to up-grade from FTM 2005 and import that data. There are bad reviews about 2012 product.,Y,It is different form the old version but after using it for a while I like it better and more comprehensive than before.
5152,open-ended,B005N2CS00,How do you find your notes once you've imported your backup file?,,"Sorry, I have no answer to this problem."
5153,yes/no,B005N2CS00,Will this version work with windows 7 64 bit?,Y,Yes works great!!!! Good luck finding your family ties!!!
5154,open-ended,B005N2CS00,I have Family Tree Maker 2005 on my hard drive. I cannot find my original disk. What do I need to be able to transfer my info to a new computer?,,"If you have done research and have saved information you found from a site like Ancestry.com, there should be a file or files with your family name with the file extension '.FTM'. For instance, Jones.FTM. This is found, in Windows, under: My Documents/Family Tree Maker. You can then import or transfer that file to you new computer. If you are asking if you can install Family Tree Maker on a new computer without the original install CDs, then I think you will have to buy a new copy of FTM. Sorry."
5155,yes/no,B005N2CS00,I have older version of Family Tree Maker -- version 10 for XP. I recently bought new laptop running Windows 8. Do I need to buy newer version?,?,Version 10 should run fine on Win8. I have a Win8 box that I recently installed a lot of XP vintage software on and have had no issues. I was using 10 but switched to Essentials 2012 because of issues with merging web info with my tree. Ancestry support told me what I was seeing was a known issue and would likely not be corrected. They suggested I upgrade because the latest version doesn't have the problem and so far it has been fine. I'm still running Essentials 2012 on my XP box because that is where my files are but I'll eventually reinstall and move everything to the Win8 machine.
5156,open-ended,B005N2CS00,Family Tree Maker: Does anyone know if you can put Family Tree Maker on a Kindle or anything like that?,,http://longlostrelatives-smp.blogspot.com/2010/12/kindle-for-genealogy-redux.html
5157,open-ended,B005N2CS00,Family Tree 2012 vs Family Tree 2012 Essentials: What is the difference between Family Tree 2012 and Family Tree 2012 Essentials?,,Did you ever get an answer? I got both for Christmas and I don't know what the difference(s) is/are.
5158,yes/no,B005PODUAS,"Does it teach how to read music notes, tab. This is the main reason I want to buy this type of program.",?,It teaches Tab. Good program and very easy to use.
5159,yes/no,B005PODUAS,"Do I need to buy anything else with this, like the guitar to USB interface?",?,You will need a microphone our some way to get sound into the computer
5160,yes/no,B005PODUAS,"I've never played guitar before an I don't read music, will I learn to play with this?",Y,Yes
5161,open-ended,B005PODUAS,Is this plug n Play or do you have to hunt for drivers etc.,,"Plug and play for me, good luck!"
5162,yes/no,B005QSBQEK,Will this work on Windows 8?,N,No it will not.
5163,yes/no,B005QSBQEK,will this load older version files,?,"Hi - wasn't sure, still not positive. Went back and found some greeting cards from 2009, using version 20, and they worked OK, others did not. But I've been using one form or another of 23 for many years and going strong. Sorry I can't be more helpful. Also should mention that I have a copy of my old Windows XP virtual installed (when I bought this PC which used Windows 7) just so my Print 23 would work. It works on both."
5164,open-ended,B005QSBQEK,wiil the print shop 3.5 work on windows 8,,I use version 3.0 and it works fine on Windows 8.
5165,yes/no,B005QSBQEK,Can this be installed on Windows 7?,Y,Yes. I installed on windows 7 and all my old files came over from my old Xperia and works great
5166,open-ended,B005QSBQEK,We cannot load Print Shop 23 on our Windows 7 system.,,"I had no problem, mine was downloaded to windows seven and it works fine. Did you try downloading it manually, I am not that computer savvy, so I am afraid I am not much help, sorry"
5167,yes/no,B005QSBQEK,is there a way you can reverse writing to do iron-on transfers,?,"I don't know about doing reverse writing, but Print Shop 23 has transfers available in it's project picker. After you finish your project and choose print it will automatically reverse the print for iron on transfers. Hope this helps."
5168,open-ended,B005QSBQEK,Are the images on the DVD or accessed online? Approximately how many are photos?,,It has many images on the disc and more are accessible online. The program has more clip-art images than photos. However you can import your own photos and images easily.
5169,yes/no,B005QSBQEK,Is this compatible with Windows 7?,?,yes...Im using windows 7 on my laptop.
5170,yes/no,B005QSBQEK,Is this software pretty easy to use? My old version is from 1997. Don't need anything fancy! Just making flyers or posters.,Y,"I love this software. In fact, I depend on it so much that I have 3 of the same one just in case..........and yes, it is pretty easy to use. I used it on my old PC which was Vista and it worked great; I use it on Windows 7 and it works great on that. You just have to monkey around with it a little and get to know your way around, but the project selection makes things quite simple. I think you will like it."
5171,yes/no,B005QSBQEK,Could I do a funeral memory folder with this program?,?,"Hello, Cheryl. First, may I extend my sincere sympathy for your loss. I wasn't sure what you meant by a ""funeral folder"" so I looked it up, bless Google. From what I saw, there is special paper you can buy for that and I honestly can't see any reason why you could not make your folders with this program. It does so many things, works with so many different types of paper, and it is really easy to navigate through. I mainly make greeting cards for my children and grandchildren with it, but can't see why you couldn't make a booklet. Good luck to you. Cheryl (also)"
5172,open-ended,B005S4Y13K,Get error when trying to download: Anyone else having trouble?,,"Save the link to your desktop, then, log out of amazon then close your browser, then, double click the link on your desktop to go back to the page you were on to download. Sometimes the pc, or site or browser, needs a cick in the butt. If all this doesn't work, call amazon help desk and read them the message and they should be able to help. Hope this helps, good luck."
5173,yes/no,B005S4Y13K,Is this product for filing your 2011 taxes,Y,Yes. I started using TurboTax when I stopped doing income taxes professionally with a much more sophisticated program and this program was just as good and actually easier to use.
5174,open-ended,B005S4Y13K,"Does the 2011 Deluxe version have anything for a small business I run on the side, or do I need to find a Home and Business version?",,There are questions about business income. You have to physically look for it. There is a schedule C available. How ever I used to own a business and I recommend the Home and Business Turbo Tax. You get a lot more help with preparing your taxes.
5175,yes/no,B005S4Y13K,is it printable,Y,"Yes, you can print a paper copy and also e-file if you wish."
5176,yes/no,B005S4Y13K,is a printable program,N,I do not understand your question.
5177,open-ended,B005S4Y13K,"Second State: Does anyone know how this works if I were to buy the Deluxe edition, would or could I buy a second state version or something?",,I have been able to get a second state for the last three years with no problems.
5178,open-ended,B005S4Y13K,Is the download version the same as the CD version? (1) Are the two versions exactly the same?,,I'm interested in the answer to this as well. I've always bought the cd version thinking it's the only way I can share with family members. (I believe it's up to 3 filings)? Would the 'download' version allow for this too?
5179,open-ended,B005S4Y13K,On the Cloud? How much memory does this eat up?,,The product here is the one you install on your computer. They do have a web-only version on turbotax.com you can buy there. As for how much space it takes up...the minimum requirements state: RAM: 512 MB (1 GB recommended) Windows Hard Drive: Federal Products: 500 MB for TurboTax (plus up to 1.5 GB for Microsoft .NET 4 if not already installed) State Products: 15 MB Federal plus State Products: 515 MB for TurboTax (plus up to 1.5 GB for Microsoft .NET 4 if not already installed) Mac OS Hard Drive: Federal Products: 300 MB State Products: 30 MB Federal plus State Products: 330 MB
5180,open-ended,B005S4Y13K,How do I efile a federal and mail a state return? Has anyone figured out how to do an efile/mail for federal/state returns with this software package?,,"Yes. Just choose to print out to mail both, get the state and mail it then go back & choose to efile the fed only. This should solve your problem. You have to, lots of times, go around the options or trick the pc to get what you want. Hope this helps, good luck."
5181,yes/no,B005S7ZMXA,will this work on windows 8?,?,"Bob, I am running it with Windows 8.0 without any problems. I hav not upgraded to 8.1 so can't answer to that. Rick"
5182,yes/no,B005S7ZMXA,Will this software covert written notes once scanned into text?,N,"No. For that, you may want to look into a Windows 8 tablet with stylus or possibly a Samsung Galaxy Note tablet. It's difficult for software to recognize handwriting from a picture (after you've written) and even software that claims to be able to do it, won't do a very good job unless you already write like a computer. There are also a few technologies that use a special pen and paper and the pen records what you write on the paper and can then dump that data into a computer which can probably perform handwriting recognition. Don't know how accurate it would be though."
5183,yes/no,B005S7ZMXA,i want to scan word documents (a manuscript) into editable word files. no headers or footers or page numbers; mostly plain paragraphs. will,?,"I assume you are talking about scanning in a plain paper document with no particularly unusual formatting. What you'll get in ABBY is an editable representation of that document with ABBY's best guess as to the identity of poorly or lightly printed characters. You then work through the document, page by page and line by line making any corrections that you require. After that you can save the edited document to MS Word or to your favorite word processing program for further touch-up. How much touch-up required depends on your preferences set in the word processing program and how closely those preferences match those that you chose in ABBY. The most obvious match-up you'd want to watch for is font type and point size. Margins, indents, tab spacing and line spacing settings are also important. You want the document in the word processor to look as closely as possible like the paper document you originally scanned into ABBY. This may take a little playing around to get right, but is tedious rather than difficult. For a reasonably clearly printed paper document, the accuracy of the letter-by-letter translation into the editable image will surprise you. As to headers, footers and page numbers, you can de-select those before you save the edited image to your word processing program, simply by drawing a box around the elements of the image that you want to save."
5184,yes/no,B005S7ZMXA,"Does Abbyy Finereader 11 Professional come with a CD for downloading. For me, downloading software from the interest is very slow.",N,"The product I purchased was the one that came with a disk. However, Amazon also has sellers that sell just the download for programs. So, you have to make sure the product you are considering is one with the disk. BTW, Love the program!!!! Came from OmniPro, 2010 version whatever that was. All of a sudden, that program stopped working and the fix that was required???? Omni Pro required us to purchase a newer version holding us hostage until we updated. We help inmate authors selfpublish books and use our scanner every day - so their little trick essentially disrupted our business. We are not only happy we found a solution around Omni Pro - but the Abbyy Finereader 11 Pro is such a better program than Omni Pro."
5185,yes/no,B005S7ZMXA,Does windows 8.1 and finereader pro v12 are compatible ? i don't succeed to make it work .strange finereader spring 6 work but not v12 !!,?,I had xp pro now with new computer I have windows 7 My opinion I consider Abby Finereader a garbage program with lousy tech support. most definitely not worth the money. I use a prf converter program. good luck
5186,yes/no,B005S7ZMXA,Will this version redact?,N,"Not sure I know what you mean. I understand ""redact"" to mean to block out text we don't want someone else to be able to read. Not sure how that translates into OCR software."
5187,yes/no,B005S7ZMXA,"When you replace a hard drive, will Abbyy allow re-installing the software without having to re-purchase the license?",Y,"Yes, I'm guessing it will. We got a new computer to add to our home network and I was able to load and use it from there."
5188,yes/no,B005S7ZMXA,"will it work with a TWAIN scanner, will it scan newspaper articles correctly, will it work with Word Perfect?",?,Call ABBY on this one - FR works with word and dff files. No OCR program is perfect but FR does do a great job.
5189,open-ended,B005S7ZMXA,"I don't like PDF. Can I scan directly to MSWord, or to the note pad?",,"You can save your scanned documents to word, excel, plain text, openoffice.org, html and a few others in addition to PDF. Lots of flexible options with this program."
5190,open-ended,B005S7ZMXA,How well does this work converting scanned tables into an editable Word/Excel file? I work as a translator and often get faxes and scans of tables.,,I typically use photos of documents for my text conversions and I find the quality of the table scan depends depends on the quality of the photo input. if the photo is slightly out of focus the ocr output is poor. A scanner should be better quality than some photos so it should work.
5191,open-ended,B005UR6AXY,"Which programs are included in this suite? Particularly looking for Word, Excel, and Access and SICK of paying subscription for Office 365.",,Word and Excel and Access are all in this package. Other things also. I have been pleased with the performance.
5192,yes/no,B005UR6AXY,does this come with frontpage 2003,N,"No it does not. The last version of office that included it, that I am aware of, is 2000. And then it was only included in the Premium and Developer editions."
5193,yes/no,B005UR6AXY,Is Office 2003 Pro compatible with Windows 8?,Y,"It should run. MS wants us to update to the ribbon format by scaring us into it. MS is stopping 2003 support, (like they supported us 2003 users anyway) in order to make us believe we have to update to the newer office versions."
5194,open-ended,B005UR6AXY,Can this be put on my home computer and also my computer at my gallery? 2 computers?,,"Yes, You could install 2 computers as a second time without having any problems. Thanks N Tran"

This is the case if you buy it directly from Topazlabs right now."
5199,open-ended,B005VDPOR0,"Is everything fully functional once you load the CD, or do you still have to download something from the site to get this all to work?",,"No need to download anything from the Topaz site once you install the CD. But, you do have to use the product serial license code when activating each segment of the bundle. Would be nice if one activation worked for the whole package."
5200,open-ended,B005VDPOR0,What is the version number?,,Each plugin has it's own version number and are updated as needed. Visit the site: http://www.topazlabs.com/
5201,yes/no,B005VDPOR0,Topaz website ha 16 products in the its Bundle. The reviews mention 14. Do I need to buy the newest products separately?,?,"Correct, the newest bundle has 16 products. This particular bundle was rolled right as the newest two were being released (Stars Effects and Restyle, if I'm not mistaken)."
5202,yes/no,B005VDPOR0,Is this a stand alone software product?,?,I use mine as a plug-in for photoshop. Not sure if you can use it with Lightroom. Not sure if it works as a stand alone. You can get on Topaz's website at topazlabs.com and email them. They are really good a getting back with you quickly. I really love this software. It takes a little while to learn how to use it but I love the results on my photos. I hope this helps.
5203,open-ended,B005VDPOR0,Are these for students? I am not! Can I still use them? Do they come with serial numbers for the download?,,I Purchased this set and have had NO Problem and they are as Spelled out Works Great
5204,yes/no,B005VDPOR0,Is the new Impression one in there? Can it be downloaded to my desktop and laptop.,?,Impression is not included.
5205,yes/no,B005VDPOR0,Does this product have a plug in for cutting out unwanted objects from your photos with just a click of the mouse?,?,I do not think so. I use it with photo shop elements and Lightroom
5206,open-ended,B005VDPOR0,IS IT FOR 64 bit or can l use it with a 32 bit,,"I can't say for sure which is included with the bundle you're looking at, but once you purchase it you can use the same license for the most recent versions from the Topaz website. They do have products not included in this bundle, but Adjust/BW Effect/DeNoise/etc should all work. They also have great customer support if you have troubles."
5207,open-ended,B005WX2YH2,Buy Level 1 to try it out or bite the bullet and get all 5? More $/better bargain...,,Definitely try out lvl 1 first. The learning style is not for everybody.
5208,yes/no,B005WX2YH2,Can I download the program on more than one machine?,N,"No, not unless you've paid for two licenses. However you can move your license to another machine as long as you stop using it on the original machine. You might have to contact Rosetta customer support to do this."
5209,yes/no,B005WX2YH2,Will this work on a windows 8 tablet ?,?,The downloaded version works with windows 8.
5210,yes/no,B005WX2YH2,Will this download work for Windows 8?,Y,"Yes, I am currently using Rosetta stone on Windows 8."

5212,yes/no,B005WX2YH2,Can Rosetta Stone language programs be used on my Kindle Fire?,?,"The one that you purchase from Amazon is designed for PC use. However, Rosetta Stone just rolled out as a part of the online access, tablet and smartphone use. I do not know how well it works, since I have very limited bandwidth due to us living out in the sticks and I have to use a satellite system for net access. With my purchase from Amazon, I was able to access Rosetta Stone's online program (called ""totale"", I believe) that allows me to sync the online program with my desktop, so when I travel, I can use my laptop and the hotel bandwidth to access lessons and live tutoring sessions. Again, that's done on a PC, not a tablet."
5213,yes/no,B005WX2YH2,Can I install cd rom on my computer and on my son's tablet,Y,"I have it installed on my computer, my Surface, and my Android Tablet."
5214,yes/no,B005WX2YH2,Can the discs be played on a CD player? I would like to listen to them in my car. Thanks.,Y,This download is an interactive software meant for a computer. It doesn't have an audio on the go option.
5215,yes/no,B005WX2YH2,I need that Spanish (Latin America) course in German to Spanish. Can I vary the written language ?,N,No
5216,yes/no,B005WX2YH2,Is the download version like the CD version that allows up to 5 users on 2 PC's?,Y,Yes. Both the CD and download versions allow up to 5 users and on 2 PC's.
5217,yes/no,B005WX2TWW,"I am going to Germany in September, I know little german, will this help me in the time I have?",Y,"Yes, definitely. However, you will need to spend about 30 minutes a day working through the lessons, and make use of the chat and online conversation features."
5218,yes/no,B005WX2TWW,can i listen to this in the car,N,No
5219,open-ended,B005WX2TWW,with this download for mac will i be able to redownload if i were to get a new laptop,,Contact Rosetta Stone(U.S). They will send the program to your new laptop.
5220,open-ended,B005WX2TWW,"SO if i buy this thru amazon, my husband only has access to it for 3 months?",,"Your husband would have limited (3 month) access to the online benefits of Rosetta Total-e, which included virtual tutoring sessions and other interactive features. However, he would be able to continue using via the standard Rosetta learning program indefinitely.. Just without those other benefits. Do it! It's certainly worth it, and you can get a discount to extent the online features for a much longer period of time."
5221,yes/no,B005WX2TWW,"will I be able to continue to use the software from Germany, once I've downloaded it?",Y,Yes you can! You download it and can use it from anywhere - no need for Internet once you've downloaded it!
5222,open-ended,B005WX2TWW,What happens after 3 months after purchase with the Mac Download -- do I not have access to the software? this seems to be a disadvantage vs. the disc,,"Unfortunately, I have been working with their tech support on this same issue and nothing seems to work so far. Good luck to you."
5223,open-ended,B005WX2TWW,What MAC version is this best suited for? I have LION 10.7.5 and I'm skeptical that it will work correctly.,,"I run the latest OSX Lion 10.8.3 and works perfectly. I started using it on 1.8.0 I think, works perfectly"
5224,open-ended,B005WX2RK6,I'm a dinosaur who prefers CDs to downloading. Am I sacrificing instruction? Will I need headphones?,,"I would say it depends on your download speed. I have VERY SLOW internet where I live. It works great on the computer as an application. However, you may be able to utilize some of the online tutorials better than I. As far as instruction goes, I think you get the same stuff, either way. I did the download and I am loving it."
5225,open-ended,B005WX2RK6,How many devices are supported?,,All iOS devices plus all computers
5226,yes/no,B005WX2RK6,"if i buy the mac download but really want to use all of the features on ipad, will the mac download give me the same functionality on ipad?",N,"No, it does not translate to the ipad. I wanted to do the same thing, but I was unable."
5227,yes/no,B005WX2RK6,Will this work on the iPad 2?,?,Definitely
5228,yes/no,B005Z0HAKS,I have a softbound history book of a nonprofit that we would like to scan and then be able to insert new clear copies of the existing photos. When that is done we want to reissue the soft copy and also have an e-book version. Is PagePlus X6 the...,Y,"I have never done anything as big as that, but I believe you should be able to do that with PagePlus X6 or X7. I have done essentially the same thing with much smaller articles. Breaking it down into chapters may help. VR, Jim Nolan VR"
5229,yes/no,B005Z0HAKS,does it work with Vista 64bit,Y,"I don't know, I have windows 7 with window xp mode and it works great, windows 7 is 64 bit"
5230,yes/no,B005Z0HAKS,"I need a program that will easily let me create a newsletter for my business, save it as a PDF, and then email it out to managers. Will this do that?",Y,"Yes, it does great, it always says there is a problem, but there never is. It could be my system."
5231,open-ended,B005Z0HAKS,On how many computers are you permitted to use the software?,,"Having only a notebook computer, I've never encountered this issue with this particular software. While some software, such as anti-virus protection or Microsoft Office Home and Student, often allow installation on up to three computers, such a feature is a marketing point and is stated explicitly in the advertising and promotional literature. Since Serif makes no such claim on their website (and I don't have the box to look at), then I would assume that the installation is limited to just one machine at a time."
5232,open-ended,B005ZXROO2,Quicken vs. Microsoft Money: Does anyone else miss Microsoft Money?,,Yes. And I'm yet to find a replacement. Although I recently discovered that Microsoft offer the sunset version for free by download. I'm seriously considering using this. I actually purchased YNAB but it lacks so many features Money had.
5233,open-ended,B005ZXROO2,Down Loading transactions to Quicken 2009: What kind of BS is this?,,There is a huge market for a financial management tool that works. It might take another year but there will soon be a replacement by a vendor that cares and will fix the issues that have made the Quicken and Turbo tax experience so painful.
5234,yes/no,B005ZXROO2,Was just about to upgrade ... saving my $$$ Deceptive???,?,"I've been seriously considering upgrading Quicken for several years (I've been using v 2004), but every time I look at the Amazon reviews and read about the unfixed bugs, terrible support and general user dissatisfaction, I figure I'll wait til Intuit gets its act together. With 44% of users still being so dissatisfied, I'll keep waiting. Too bad, since I'd like to take advantage of the transaction downloads."
5235,open-ended,B005ZXROO2,How do I access previous years' files?,,"I have the 2012 version. Love it! Do you mean to purchase it, or did you mean to access YOUR old files on your PC. If on your PC, click previous version, on purchasing the 2012 version, I'd say do search online & state you want that year version, same as if you were trying to purchase an old book..."
5236,yes/no,B005ZXROO2,Will this version work with Windows 8?,Y,Yes
5237,open-ended,B005ZXROO2,"Quicken Cash Flow View: Can anyone confirm that Quicken 2012 still has the Cash Flow page that breaks down Income, Expenses, and what's left over for the month (just like 2009 &amp; 2010 versions)?",,"It was put back into 2011 with an update sometime in Nov. 2010. I had to set it up special in 2011. That means I had to find it in the menu, and set it up as my opening page on Quicken. Not the same way as the prior versions had it. Its hidden this time. I am sure 2012 is the same way. I would try the Quicken discussion page if you can not find it. Good luck"
5238,yes/no,B005ZXRQ5E,will it work on mac?,?,I'm sorry but I do not know. I use a windows system. I want to say that it should from memory but I cannot verify. Again my apologies!
5239,yes/no,B005ZXRQ5E,will this work in Microsoft 7 ???,Y,It worked on my Windows 7 system.
5240,yes/no,B005ZXRQ5E,will it work on mac?,Y,I have Windows 7 and I can't even get it to sync with my bank.
5241,yes/no,B005ZXRQ5E,will it work on mac?,?,Checked the box it came in and only Windows OS are listed. Sorry.
5242,open-ended,B00604ICGO,Bugs on 403(b) and 457 contributions: Anybody else has this problem?,,"Yes, the same thing happened to me. I called the H&R Block Help Center to report the problem. It looks to me like the workaround is simply to tell the system that your contribution limit is higher -- which in fact it is."
5243,open-ended,B00604ICGO,System requirements - will this run on Windows XP SP2?,,XP SP2 (read my comments)
5244,yes/no,B00604ICGO,does deuction pro work,Y,"Yes, I am happy with it."

5250,yes/no,B006085KLA,I have a HP oficejet 4500 wireless scanner linked wireless to a toshiba Satellite C675 laptop with Windows 7. Is this a good hardware base for S/O?,?,"Generally, Toshiba does a good job of communicating with peripherals, and HP shouldn't have any issues as the AIO has scanning specific software. I would download a free PDF creator such as Primo PDF and print to this, verses the printer, which in turn creates a PDF document, which will insert right into SO database with ease. I have found that certain documents from the Internet will print to Primo PDF, whereas they normally take forever to translate through the browser and print for scanning purposes. By printing to Primo PDF, you also eliminate the need to scan to pdf."
5251,yes/no,B006085KLA,"Is this product good for at home bills to go paperless like ""neat receipt"" which advertises on TV?",Y,"Yes, that's what I use it for as well as any other records where I want to reduce paperwork clutter. You can use it for about anything e.g. medical records, EOBs from your medical insurer, photo collections, cd collections, legal documents, recipes - about anything you can think of. The program has many templates for ""filing cabinets"" which are more business oriented, but you can easily make and customize/modify your own. And all your data is easily retrieved when you need it. Also found tech support very helpful in answering questions/problems. Neat receipt hardware/software was way too expensive for me and you can use just about any scanner you like - if your scanner has OCR software so much the better."
5252,yes/no,B006085KLA,"Does Speedy Organizer have thumbnails so you can identify cabinets, folders, and files easily?",?,"Within Speedy Organizer ""The Digital File Cabinet for Windows"" there are many different views to look at cabinets, folders and files including thumbnails. You can choose the best view for you."
5253,open-ended,B006085KLA,"Can I install this on my three computers, or is it for only one computer.",,Hi Speedy Organizer by rights can be installed on up to three computers. Like Microsoft Outlook this software will work on each of those computers but the information will not be shared. If you need to share information you will need to purchase a Speedy Organizer multi user solution - answered by Speedy Solutions Inc.
5254,yes/no,B006085KLA,Does Speedy Organizer work with Windowsm 8.1 and/or Windows 10?,?,Works with windows 8.1

5257,yes/no,B006085KLA,Does it work well with Windows 8,Y,I've have had it for about 90 days. I find it is working very good with Windows 8.1.
5258,yes/no,B006085KLA,Can it scan and organize business cards?,Y,"Yes, but maybe not the way you think. You set up a template of fields that are important to you and after you scan them . . . you enter the data into that field. I tried the NEAT scanner which was very expensive, and it really didn't work the way they said on TV. You had to type stuff into that as well, so I find that to be able to find documents it is ideal. If you just want to scan business cards and create a database, I would look for another product."
5259,open-ended,B006085KLA,Once you scan a document does the software automatically scan for keywords and keep them so the document can be searchable?,,I deleted Speedy Organizer from my computer. I found it to be to complicated to use.

5261,open-ended,B0061HALKU,Is this Version 11.0? Does it install on 2 computers? Is it the retail box edition with cd?,,Not sure what version but it does install on two computers. Just be advised that Microsoft is ending support for Office 2003 as of April 8th 2014. They will no longer issue updates for it. This also includes security updates.
5262,open-ended,B0061HALKU,"Please confirm: Will it work if installed on Win 7 machine? (I saw ""Erica""s answer but want to be sure since I don't Amazon accepts S/W returns.

5273,open-ended,B0063B242M,does it record from DVR cameras and will it work on a mac?,,Camera must have RCA plugs or a converter to them. On a Mac you need to check with Avid on that.
5274,yes/no,B0063B242M,"Does this dazzel works with windows 8, 32 bit?",?,"I'm not sure. The package says system requirements are Windows 7, Vista, or XP. I am using Windows 7."

However, there are some programs out there that can make to fullscreen after you've finished capturing. But it will stretch and cut the image and it will make it look off from the original video.

5282,yes/no,B0064562B6,I am a retired school psychologist with more than 30 years in education. Would I qualify for this educational version? Mark Haas,Y,"Hi Mark, the way I qualified for the educational version of Final Draft was by giving the company my school email address. They sent a verification email to that address and then I had to reply from that address to prove I had an .edu email. If you still have access to your school email, this may work. I believe they have other forms of verification they will accept. Maybe you can get a letter from an administrator from your school? Here is the link for eligibility: http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/Final_Draft_Eligibility_Requirements.pdf Hope this helps! Good luck with your screenwriting :) Jo"

5284,open-ended,B0064PFB9U,Is this an upgrade or full product?,,"Excel, Word and Powerpoint. That is it."
5285,yes/no,B0064PFB9U,Is this compatable with a mac pro os x 10.8.4 - do need the excel 2013 version,?,"I have an iMac (less than a year old, running OSX 10.8.4) and this runs great for me . Not sure if there is any reason why a MacPro would be any different. hope this helps some ;)"

5287,yes/no,B0064PFB9U,Does it download on macbook air?,?,I downloaded it to a current generation macbook air and it has worked fine.
5288,open-ended,B0064PFB9U,My mac tells me it does not support this product. I just purchased and downloaded it. Help,,I'm running 10.7.5 on an older MAcBook Pro and it downloaded just fine for me. Do you have a different version? If you just purchased your MAC call apple customer support. They are super to work with. tom
5289,yes/no,B0064PFB9U,Do I need to have Parallels installed on my MacBook before I can download and use Office 2011?,?,"I loaded office on my iMac, i do not have parallels installed. Works fine."

5291,yes/no,B0064PFB9U,"Does ""Office: Mac 2011' work with Mac OS 10.7.5?",?,Probably. I believe the Microsoft suite I am running is the Student edition (I could not confirm it) and it is definitely 2011 running on my Mac Air OS 10.7.5.
5292,yes/no,B0064PFB9U,will this work with OS 10.6.8?,Y,Yes. I use it on my computer and I don't have any issues or problems with it. I hope this helped.
5293,open-ended,B0064PF4ZQ,"Aside from $40 in price, what is the difference between the two platforms listed - Mac and Mac Download?",,"The Mac gives you the product in a box, and is only available for use on one computer. There is no disc only a product number. The Mac Download provides you with the digital platform, and in most cases can be used on more than one computer. You can also access this from your software library. This would be like actually having the disc."
5294,yes/no,B0064PF4ZQ,"Are there fewer problems with the new 2013 Office for Mac versions of power point, Xcell, and word?",?,"I am yet to have any issues with the new version, but again, I'm not creating huge excel sheets with multiple macros etc. On Word, inputting images and resizing them have not been an issue as I previously heard. As I use it more I will follow up with more input."
5295,yes/no,B0064PF4ZQ,can i use this without outlook,Y,"Yes you can, but why wouldn't you by the version without outlook for less money? You can use outllook but it won't sync with ical or contacts on the mac."

5297,open-ended,B0064PF4ZQ,What's different from the home-student version?,,"There was only one real difference for me and that was it included Outlook. If you go to the microsoft web page they have a chart that shows a comparison of all their Office products. It may help you make your decision on which one to buy. Also, I chose to buy the Office Suite instead of doing the Office 365. It may be cheaper for the first 2 yeas, but, after that you are loosing money, at least that is the way I figured it. If you do buy I suggest that you get the disk s it is always available and you have a less time consuming process than doing it on line. Especially, if you have a slow internet connection. I did my first attempt using a hotel internet, which ended up with an error. I went to the Apple Store, took a workshop and used their internet to download the Yosemite upgrade in 45 minutes."
5298,yes/no,B0064PF4ZQ,Can this product &amp; its license be migrated to a new computer if my laptop dies?,Y,"Yes, call support. If you can't request to authentication transfer due to a hardware failure, they can help transfer your license."
5299,open-ended,B0064PF4ZQ,what's in this version?,,"With the question, I'm not sure what specifics you might be looking for but, this version has Excel, Outlook, Powerpoint, and Word. All have been very stable and worked very well with the MAC OS. I have done a number of presentations, spreadsheets, papers and I deal with a lot of email. It's been a great version for me."
5300,yes/no,B0064PF4ZQ,Can MS Office 2011 be used on Mac 10.10.2,Y,"Yes, I believe it can. Think there are some updates for MS Office."
5301,yes/no,B0064PF4ZQ,Is it possible to download the full version. I have internet issues on the Mac that I need to install this on?,?,I had downloaded this at purchase. You should be able to download the file from another computer put it in a flash drive then install. You do need internet access for activation though.
5302,open-ended,B0064PF4ZQ,"i just bought this product and requested Spanish language but, I it is in English, pelease explain to me how to change the language?",,"I found this on Microsoft's website: You can download Office for Mac 2011 in the language of your choice by clicking the link below, clicking Get Started, and providing your Office 2011 product key: Office for Mac 2011 | Download Site (http://www.microsoft.com/mac/office-2011-digital-download) It is not possible to change the language of the Office for Mac user interface (menu items, buttons, or other interface elements) or Help content without reinstalling the software.

5309,open-ended,B0065OPJ1U,what is the best bang for the buck webcam or camera to use with this software? need beginner camera/webcam for 12 year old.,,"Okay, so here is the deal. Dragonframe works only with certain cameras. Keeping that in mind, there are A LOT of them (the full list is here: http://www.dragonframe.com/camera.php) Regardless of what kind of camera you buy, your going to have to spend AT LEAST a couple hundred dollars. Because Dragonframe is a program used by professionals in the industry, most people who usually buy Dragonframe are also people who are working professionally. Since your boy is 12 years old, you won't have to by him a $45,000 dollar camera BUT a camera (much like a car) is an investment. So spending $100-300 realistically isn't going to probably happen. Keeping that in mind, here are some things to consider. Obviously as with most things, newer models are going to cost more. A 5D Mark ii is going to be cheaper than the Mark iii for example. I'd recommend sticking with the Canon camera or maybe the web cameras. The web camera's are really tricky because you can buy something that looks like it's going to deliver but then not. Something else to remember is that with many camera's, the lens that use is really going to impact the quality of images you take. The body's of the cameras basically set up your limitations, what it can or can't do. The lenses are adaptable because each lens works in a different way. Of course, the nicer the lens the more expensive usually. Most Canon cameras also come with the lenses when you buy them. Make sure you know your getting a lens if you buy online. Most of the other camera's on the list (the blackmagics and others) are the ""professional professional"" meaning your going to spend at least, AT LEAST $10,000 on them. I'd recommend looking into, for you - and of course this is just my opinion BUT - the Canon EOS 60D, Canon EOS 500D, and the Canon EOS Digital Rebel T3i. The T3i is sort of like the ""professional camera"" before it made it to professional (if that makes sense.) It's going to give you some pretty good range for the most part and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. If you go to an animation school and are studying stop motion animation, you use these cameras for your assignments. Something to consider? I'd really, really, REALLY strongly urge and recommend printing out the list and bringing it to a camera shop somewhere near you and talking with someone. They'll be able to give you the ultimate rundown on what they think you should do. Anyway, I hope this helped. I'm a film student so I've been exposed to all sorts of cameras and machinery relating to both film shooting and animation, so of course my opinion is going to biased but I hope this helped. Your kids are very lucky."
5310,yes/no,B0065OPJ1U,Will it work with Windows 8?,?,"Yes...you will have to update dragonframe 3 to the current version of 3.5, which is a free update"
5311,yes/no,B0065OPJ1U,Will this version work with a pc and a mac?,Y,Yes. The install disc contains both the Windows and Mac version.
5312,open-ended,B0065OPJ1U,can I use this for multi-axis timelapse? Can I control stepper motors?,,"Hi Paul, I bought this for my son so I'll check with him!"
5313,open-ended,B0065OPJ1U,"I just bought this product. It says it's Mac compatible. My new Mac, of course, doesn't come with a disc drive. Where do I go to download my program?",,Try this link http://www.dragonframe.com/downloads/
5314,open-ended,B0065OPJ1U,I have seen that the DF 3.5 software is compatible with the Blackmagic Cinema Camera. I was wondering if the same is true for the 3.0?,,I would go to their site and look at the list of supported cameras. I got the Rebel T3 because all the others were VERY expensive.
5315,open-ended,B0065OPJ1U,"I'm interested in making both SM and regular videos. Can this be used for basic editing as well, or should I also get something like Sony Vegas Pro 12",,"You should definitely invest in an actual editing suite as well...Dragonframe is primarily for stop motion alone...but you will need an editing software anyway if you plan on adding any kind of post visual effects, color grading, or puppet wire removal. Hope I helped"
5316,yes/no,B0065OPJ1U,"When you buy this, will you will be able to update to 3.5 for free?",Y,Yes. I did!
5317,open-ended,B0065OPJ1U,does anyone know how to do stop motion videos if so please repy with your email i want to learn how to do it,,"I purchased Dragonframe and used one of my web cam. Take shots while moving the image, edit and modify the image, replay the takes, now you a stop motion movie."
5318,yes/no,B0065OPJ1U,is this what the youtuber counter656 uses to do his action figure stop motion videos im asking cause i want to learn how to do that,?,"Possibly, Dragon Frame is very good a but rather complex. You could get the similar effect with Stop motion Pro which is easier to use but a bit more pedestrian."
5319,open-ended,B0066QBXC6,What do you need to do to make it work once you arrive?,,Nothing just put the chip in . I think I had to go I to the set up on the GPS and change country in start up settings . We always rent one from car rental people . We were glad to buy the chip and bring our own and what's really great is the addresses will be saved for our next trip to Costa Rica good luck !! Mac
5320,open-ended,B0066QBXC6,How does the 30 day license work? what happens after 30 days? Do I buy another one for next trip?,,"I'm assuming it doesn't work anymore and you need to buy another one. I haven't tried since I was there less than 30 days. I think you can pay more for a long term one but roads are constantly being built so unless you're going back soon, 30 day one is good."
5321,yes/no,B0066QBXC6,will sd card work in novi 200,?,A Nuvi? Not sure. Aak the seller on their website.
5322,open-ended,B0066QBXC6,"costa rica gps maps for garmin units , this SD card work any GPS?",,I used GPS map with 30 days licence for Costa Rica at Garmin nuvi 700 and it worked good. For other GPS i do not know.
5323,open-ended,B0066QBXC6,Can somebody explain the 30 Days License? Does it begin when you purchase it...or when you plug it in? How does the info disappear from your SD card,,The 30 days begins when you plug it in and start to use it. The license is on a separate SD card.
5324,yes/no,B0066QBXC6,Will this work with the Garmin Nuvi 50LM?,?,"It should. As long as you have a ad slot in your GPS, it will load and go. Used it last winter and it was awesome. Would not drive all over without it"
5325,yes/no,B0066QBXC6,Will this work in my garmin nuvi 1300,Y,"I used it with my nuvi, but I don't know the model number...it worked great!"
5326,open-ended,B0068M5ZCM,What are the options to 'upload' all my written recipes with your software? This is a big part of what I need.,,"You can put your own recipes in this software. I did a cookbook for my children a few years ago and also put most of the recipes from it onto my Cook'n. you can also make your own cookbook from the software but at the time i found it easier to use MS Publisher. I need to do another printing because i have gotten many more requests for it, so may try it this time from Cook'n and see if it's easier with version 10. But it is a good place to organize all of your own family recipes."
5327,open-ended,B0068M5ZCM,Are my Cookbook recipes that i input located on your server or on my computer data base/? I lost access to the internet on my desktop.,,Your recipe database is located on your computer.
5328,open-ended,B0068M5ZCM,A review said you had to enter Brand Names on ingredients - Is that correct?,,"No, this is not correct. The software gives you the option of entering specific brand information when entering a recipe but it is not required. If you add new ingredients to the ingredient list, you also have the option of entering the corresponding Brand information but it is not required. FYI...the Brand information is used by the software to compute nutrition facts, estimate grocery shopping costs, and so forth. One of the neat things about Cook'n is that you can actually switch from one brand to another and get a different nutritional result. This makes it possible for you to ""healthify"" a recipe by simply changing brands. It's pretty powerful that way."
5329,open-ended,B0068M5ZCM,version 10 vs. version 11,,"Version 10 I think It was such a waste of space I uninstalled it. It seems like - since I registered with them online - I got a product offering email from them about 'new features'. So there's probably a newer version. I have the Food Network App on my iPhone now and it has everything my wife and I need for cooking for parties with friends, holidays, etc. Hope that helps. Mountainwestman"
5330,yes/no,B0068M5ZCM,I would like to know more about the scanning feature. Does it have it's own O.C.R. program included?,?,"The way I used it is this..scan your recipe. Access Cook'n. Hit the scan feature. Choose the recipe that you scanned from my scans. When the recipe shows up on the left, you highlight the item...i.e. ""name"", the in the box that has the functions, click name and it show up on the line for name. Do the same for description, ingredients and directions. Very easy. I love this feature. This option is available with Cook'n 11."
5331,yes/no,B0068M5ZCM,does it work with windows 8,Y,"Absolutely. I asked the company that question myself before buying it. Yes, it works well with Windows 8. You will love it."
5332,yes/no,B0068M5ZCM,Is it easy to use,Y,"Yes it is. There is a video on the Cook'n website that you can watch to see how to use it. I love it because: I can import recipes from other sites. I can add my own in a ""cookbook"" that I create in the program into which I can add my own recipes. You will receive a monthly newsletter with recipes and other information. You can easily click on any of those recipes and then import those into Cook'n's recipe book."
5333,yes/no,B0068M5ZCM,Does this software allow you to print on traditional recipe cards?,Y,Yes it does.
5334,open-ended,B0068M5ZCM,If I have already scanned recipes in a pdf can they be readily added to the organizer?,,"Yes, with the new 11 version of Cook'n! I saw it happen!"
5335,yes/no,B0068M5ZCM,can you use this on windows 8?,?,I have a Mac and I don't know but I do know that the Cook'n people will answer your question if you email them.
5336,open-ended,B0068TJ7OC,What happened to State e-file? Another $19.95 to state e-file?,,"State E Files have NEVER been free, and I have been using this for a decade. The option for fed free e-files have been there for years. Besides with all the printer paper I have, I don't mind spending 4 stamps (for my 2 and my senior age Dad's 2)"
5337,open-ended,B0068TJ7OC,H&amp;R Block At Home Deluxe/State 2011 Download Not Avaliable? Does anyone know why the H&amp;R Block At Home Deluxe/State 2011 is not Available for Download at amazon?,,I was wondering the same thing. Would like to get started on our taxes and have used this product for several years. I have the disk from H & R Block but it's 44.95 through the CD.
5338,yes/no,B0068TJ7OC,Can I buy this as a CD (not the download) Will there be one?,?,"Not to embarrass you, but the CD version was posted on the same day as the downloadable copy. They have both been available since before Christmas. In the software selection of the search engine put the title in and you will see it."
5339,open-ended,B0068TJ7OC,What happened to 'add to wishlist'? I can't find the 'add to wishlist' option???,,"Still there, but not to embarrass you 1) you are commenting on the downloadable version, check the CD copy. 2) Amazon does not generally read these posts."
5340,yes/no,B006CVV4HE,Do you have to have internet access to use this? We have a computer with Windows XP but no internet. There are 4-5 of us wanting to study togethebe,?,"yes, the box version has a CD-ROM which loads onto your computer. I have used the computer version on my PC a few times and there's little difference from the internet version other than appearance. However, you will not be able to chat online with other learners, or play games online with other learners. You can still play games on the computer version. My version SEEMS to suggest that I can load up to five learners on one version, but I haven't tried. Thus a learner would logon and the program would take the learner to where he/she left off. Each learner can proceed at their own pace (I think.) Four or five learners might replace the online chat feature. Good luck!"
5341,yes/no,B006CVV4HE,is this the correct choice for mexico,Y,"Yes, or the southwest where so many Spanish-speaking people live and work."
5342,open-ended,B006CVV4HE,What product should my 21yo use to refresh her Spanish? Hasn't taken it in 2 yrs and has to take college level 2 class to meet a requirement. ugh.,,"I have used Rosetta Stone (pricey), duolingo.com & udemy.com. I think udemy is the best but there's no oral component and it starts off very slow for someone who already knows the basics. If you already speak well, then you could probably skip some and do fine. Duolingo is completely free, but I had trouble with the speaking part. If you don't need this, and are just looking for a review, this would probably be your best bet."
5343,yes/no,B006CVV4HE,Is there a headset included in the box?,Y,yes
5344,yes/no,B006CVV4HE,can it be used by more than one person?,?,If they have your login information yes
5345,open-ended,B006CVV4HE,"I bought both the Spanish and French versions, but can't find either one after installing them. What am I doing wrong?",,Since I don't have your computer in front of me I can't say. The people at Rosetta can and will be able to help you. After installing my version I had to do a system recovery. It took out the program when I did it. The Rosetta folks re-installed it for me on line. They should help you too. The program is often a one time install to prevent it being passed around.
5346,open-ended,B006CVV4HE,"This version is for people whose native language is English, and who want to learn Spanish, correct?",,Absolutely! It is for English speakers who want to learn Spanish
5347,yes/no,B006CVV4HE,Can this program be used only with an iPad?,Y,Yes it is much cheaper that way
5348,open-ended,B006CVV4HE,Would this be good for middle and high school students who are beginners to Spanish?,,Yes
5349,open-ended,B006CVV4HE,Which Spanish version to choose for high school in USA?,,"I would choose something else. This is an immersion approach and will not follow normal Spanish classes which teach grammar. In addition, I did not like the user graphic interface."

5354,open-ended,B006GOFW3E,Do you need to buy anything else to go with this or does it just hook right up into the VCR and Computer?,,"You need the standard cords that you use to connect the VCR to the TV. Other than that, the package contains the software you need and it works pretty good. It starts easy enough - turns itself off when the movie ends - and allows you to trim the dead time off the front and end of the movie before translating it. Good stuff."

5366,open-ended,B006GOFW3E,I am having issues with video tear (tracking problems) when first starting to record. Fast forwarding then rewinding the tape is no help. DLR,,"I encountered the same problem after I had transferred about 15 tapes. I cleaned the recorder/playback heads and that seemed to help but still was not right...so, I had another recorder that was not as old as the one I had been using and it worked great. Try cleaning the recorder/play back heads."

5368,yes/no,B006GOFW3E,does it wok on windows 8.1,?,I use this on Windows 8.1 with no problems. Windows actually recognized it and installed the drivers for it automatically. I just had to install Roxio for the copying and editing.

5372,open-ended,B006IWDMUY,how long does the AVID verification process take?,,"The program was bought for my college-student son. Thus he registered it. It seemed that there were perhaps two medium-length forms to fill out on the Avid web site. When the last one was submitted, the verification seemed immediate. I do not recall any long delays and was in the room as the software was being registered."
5373,open-ended,B006L7KYUM,"I want to creat my own designs but I am new at embroidery, how easy is it? I have a Janome 350E that takes JEF.

Do you own the computer you want to own the software? 2. Are you the only person using the software on the computer that you own?

5386,open-ended,B006M6AR7M,"My Laptop has Windows 8, but in this page say that the requirements for Guitar Pro are Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7.

5390,open-ended,B006SOMERY,How many users and pcs?,,"In the license agreement, it says one portable and one desk top. I'm assuming that Microsoft thinks one student will have both."

5392,open-ended,B006SOMERY,Can I buy this version? Do I qualify to buy this version?,,"It's my understanding that Microsoft will have to verify that you're a student or teacher.

I am a college student but not at a university.,?,"You have to be a student or faculty at a post-secondary school, so I think you should be able to get it.

5397,yes/no,B006SOMERY,"Is it possible to buy this product for a 4th grader. His private school requires MS Word, Excel, PPt and Publisher on their laptops.",?,This version is too powerful for a fourth grader. A better option would be an Office 365 subscription.

5401,yes/no,B006SOMEVA,Are Mac office files compatible with PC office files?,Y,"Yes they are, or at least as far as I know. I've been using the Mac Office to work on PC office files for a good year now, and I have never had a compatibility issue. If you are still worried about it, you can always save in an older format using compatibility mode."
5402,yes/no,B006SOMEVA,Are Mac office files compatible with PC office files?,?,"Files created in office for Mac should be compatible with files created in office for windows and vice versa.

5409,open-ended,B006SOMEVA,How is the office mac different from the school and home mac?,,"I have only used office mac for university, so cannot really say if there is much difference as compared to home/ school mac.But its a good deal. Also you might want to check some Excel functions that i found were missing and i had to download them using Excel Stat plus which is free to download."
5410,yes/no,B006T4SQG6,I have 2 computers to install PERRLA on. My new MAC does not have a CD rom. can you provide a code to downloand onto MAC?,?,You have to contact PERRLA and they will send you the link to download to a MAC

However, you may contact PERRLA Customer Support to verify if they have a Mac version of this product. The customer support link is http://www.perrla.com/ContactSupport.aspx Best,"
5415,open-ended,B006T4SQG6,how do i register,,"Have you purchased the product? If so, you should have a key and be directed through the registration options. If not, let us know and we'll try to figure out what's going wrong for you."

5421,yes/no,B006TIDNGU,I am not currently a student but need SPSS for a work related research project. Will the license work for me?,?,"Sorry, I returned 20 for v.21. It would depend on the stats you need to run whether it is appropriate for your project."
5422,open-ended,B006TIDNGU,"when installing this, what option do I use on 2 separate computers? Can this be used for 2 different people?",,"I was able to install it on the first computer (my computer), but I was not able to install it on my friends. I was going to split it with a friend from school, but just gave up when she wasn't able to install it on her computer."
5423,yes/no,B006TZ8A5W,Can you unplug this from one family vehicle and use it on another?,Y,Yes
5424,open-ended,B006TZ8A5W,we use this for my mom who is developing dementia. My question is how do you clear all the arrows off.,,"That doesn't appear to be an option. If they are obstructing your ability to see the routes driven, zooming in the map might be helpful."
5425,open-ended,B006TZ8A5W,Does the report or alert give exact location of where the driver was when the speed limit was breeched? Or does it only show the area?,,"It shows the exact spot on the map. You can zoom down to street view too. Same with harsh breaking, etc."
5426,yes/no,B006TZ8A5W,can be instaled without the driver knowing it?,Y,"Yes, but you might want to cover the white ""MotoSafety"" logo with black electrical tape. Once installed it may be visible as you enter the car, but if blacked out it is not so noticeable."
5427,open-ended,B006TZ8A5W,"What service does this device use? I am finding a lot of these devices are using 2G from T-Mobile, which is useless in Florida. What service does th",,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM, YOU CAN BUY A BETTER GPS THAT USES ANY CELLULAR SIM CARD AND YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER EVERYTHING. THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. ALSO IF YOU BUY IT, AND JUST WANT TO TRY IT OUT AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT? YOU HAVE ALREADY ACTIVATED IT, AND WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO TURN IT OFF AND SHUT DOWN YOUR ACCOUNT. If you are tracking teenagers, they can just unplug it like nothing and throw it out the window and it's gone forever."
5428,open-ended,B006TZ8A5W,"Does it send an alert for hard cornering too, or just acceleration and braking?",,"No. Only speeding, acceleration and ""harsh braking"". Note that you have to define what speeding is and you have two categories to work with: 1)""Highways"" and 2)""smaller roads"". For each of those categories you set the speed limit (e.g., 70 mph for Highway) and the sensitivity you want (e.g., send an alert if 15 mph over). I'm not really sure how highway and smaller roads are determined. You can also set how/if you want to receive alerts....by text, email or just view them when you pull up a report. I've chosen the latter. The iphone app is helpful and I check it very frequently...mostly eliminating the need for push alerts."
5429,open-ended,B006TZ8A5W,what area of the car does the device plug into?,,Newer cars have an onboard driving port located under the steering column. I found mine by searching the model of my car and determining where the OBD port was located
5430,open-ended,B006TZ8A5W,can you put your own gsm sim card or does it require a subscription from motosafety?,,"I believe it requires the subscription from MotoSafety, but I'm not 100% sure."
5431,yes/no,B006TZ8A5W,Does it work in every vehicle?,?,As long as your vehicle has an obd2 diagnostic plug in. Or to make it easier to understand it will work on any 1996 or newer vehicle.
5432,yes/no,B006TZ8A5W,Does it send a notification if it is unplugged,?,"No, it just stops sending signals."
5433,yes/no,B006TZGJDC,would this device notify me with a change in the car's VIN number is it is placed in a different vehicle?,?,"When a device is unplugged, it is receiving no power so it is impossible for the unit to send an alert. However, you will stop seeing any tracking data for a device that has been unplugged. You can, however, receive an alert when a device is reconnected. This provides a good system for monitoring disconnected devices"
5434,open-ended,B006TZGJDC,If I have an OBD1 and I use an adapter to OBD2 will this device work?,,If you don't have an OBDII port you'll need to use the wired device. The plug in is only compatible with light to medium duty vehicles 1996 and newer (which are required to have an OBDII port)
5435,open-ended,B006TZGJDC,Are there monthly fees? If so what is the breakdown?,,"Yes. You can go on the Linxup website and find out exactly, but month to month billing is $24.99 while it is a bit cheaper if you sign up for a yearly contract, just like cell phone service. Hope this helps."
5436,open-ended,B006TZGJDC,good evening bag if the system works in venezuela,,Sorry the devices will only work in the US

5438,yes/no,B006TZGJDC,Does this work in Canada?,?,Sorry the devices will only work in the US
5439,open-ended,B006TZGJDC,Does this unit com GSM unlocked? Can it be configured to use a custom APN to set it up with local carriers Internationally ?,,No
5440,yes/no,B006TZGJDC,do you have to pay a monthly fee to use this,Y,yes you do there is a monthly fee involved it's approximately 23 dollars a month but I can assure you for peace of mind it's a excellent product and gives a lot of information
5441,open-ended,B006TZGJDC,"Hi, I'm from saudi arabia and i want to order this device, kindly let me know whether i can run a saudi sim on this device or it's locked on us ?",,Sorry the device will only work in the US
5442,open-ended,B006TZGJDC,Hola puedo usar este servicio en Colombia? en caso de NO poder esta libre para colocar una sincard de nuestro pais y usarlo?,,Sorry the device will only work in the US
5443,yes/no,B006WODYUQ,Can you verify that this is spanish used in Spain and not Latin America.,?,"Yes - the packaging & titling of Fluenz products differentiates between Spain and ""Latin America"". I cannot speak for the ""Spanish - Latin America"" variant, but the host / instructor for this product is a native of Spain and makes several distinctions (which he is quite passionate about) between Spanish and other Spanish-variants. The pronunciation of ""gracias"" (grah-THEE-ahss) would be but one example. I've found it to be quite enjoyable."
5444,open-ended,B006WODYUQ,What exactly do you get in the box for this high price? How many DVDs? Are there any audio CDs I can transfer to my iPod? How about a book?,,"5 dvds, 5 audio cds you can put in you player, no book i m afraid"
5445,open-ended,B006WODYUQ,Do you need to have a CD drive on your computer to install this or is this program available for download?,,I believe you need to install the CD in order to set yourself up with an acct with Fluenz. After the setup of the acct you will have access to the lessons online and on iPod/iPhone/iPad app.However if you would like to contact Fluenz Support you can by emailing usersupport@fluenz.com. The reps will be happy to answer your questions. They are very quick to respond and very friendly. Good luck! You'll love the program if you decide to get it.
5446,yes/no,B006WODYUQ,Can this software be used on a computer (say a work computer) without installing files/software? I would not be able to install it at work.,?,"You can activate the program on up to 3 personal computers. You have the ability to either run from the disc, or install to hard drive."
5447,yes/no,B006WODYUQ,Can I use this program on multiple computers?,?,"Katherine, if memory serves I believe the license is for up to three (3) different computers. They also have an iPhone app now that is very convenient though you will need either wifi or a cellular signal to access the content on your phone."
5448,open-ended,B006WODYUQ,"Is there an app for using the program on Android phones, or is only available for Iphones?",,"Hi Randy, We understand that Android is a priority and we're working hard on developing the app. Please bear in mind that because Android Apps have to support so many different devices it takes work to get it right. We're aiming to have the Android App out to you before the end of the year and hopefully sooner."
5449,yes/no,B006WODYUQ,Is this the most recent version?,?,"don't worry, software is always updated for free !"
5450,yes/no,B006WODYUQ,Do you need headphones,N,"No, I don`t have them & find they are not necessary."
5451,open-ended,B006WODYUQ,What level of fluency or competency can I expect after I have completed all five levels?,,"Depends what you're willing to put into it. From my own experience, I completed one to two lessons a day for a little over 60 days in advance of a language test. Keep in mind that I took Spanish in high school and two semesters in college but didn't really use it after that, so it had been over 10 years. On a six point scale where 0 indicates no knowledge, 3 is considered fluent and 5 is a native speaker, I tested at a 2 in Speaking, 2 in Listening Comprehension and 2+ in Reading. I think if you are willing to put in at least 60-90 days with this program in Spanish, you can get to a level of proficiency where you can travel comfortable in a Spanish speaking country and get yourself around as well as carry on a basic conversation. If you have some base in the language and can put in more than 90 days with this program and practice with someone who is a native speaker, you can get to fluency within 6-9 months. Hands down, there is no better language program on the market!"
5452,yes/no,B006WODYUQ,Is this version 2.10?,Y,Yes
5453,open-ended,B006WVR9GY,How can you change the printing so that you can print the picture in the middle of the photo paper?,,"try changing the settings on your computer. start at the print preview. I have also found that if i start on a page (i have windows) as a letter, attach the picture in the body of the letter, i can then change the size, location, and even the horizontal, vertical dimensions. let me know if that works for you."
5454,yes/no,B006WVR9GY,Is there a free-floating scrapbooking program?,N,Not that I am aware of.
5455,open-ended,B006WVR9GY,"What SPECIFICALLY can Aftershot Pro do? I need specific details about this software. Can this software for example remove blemishes, wrinkles?",,"Hi, it does help you remove blemish when you used the proper setting, it is difficult to fix a picture that is taking by a cell phone. With regular camera everything is easy to do. I like using this software."
5456,yes/no,B006WVR9GY,Does it handle Nikon D700 RAW files?,N,"Dear Peter B, AfterShot Pro supports RAW files for not only your Nikon 700, but for almost every Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Pentax, Samsung, Sony, Panasonic, Leica, Minolta, Kodak, Ricoh RAW images, and even Fuji X100, and all Tiff and JPEG images. For a complete list, you can go to Corel's website, and on their Support- Knowledgebase you will find a complete listing for RAW images for AfterShot Pro. I hope this answers your question. All The Best To You, Maren"
5457,yes/no,B006WVR9GY,CAN YOU ADD CAPTIONS TO EACH PHOTO,?,"You have to use an ""outside editor"" to do that."
5458,yes/no,B006WVR9GY,Can you make ebook covers with this software?,?,"I am not sure about that, I do know you can make them with Corel Draw products including Photo Paint and Graphics Suite. Some pretty good info can be found on the Corel website itself and shooting them a quick email should get you a definite answer quickly. Good luck! Cheers! Marty G"
5459,yes/no,B006WVR9GY,is this software compatible with Windows 8.1?,Y,Yes. I have had no problems with it.
5460,yes/no,B006WVR9GY,Is there a framing and background program?,?,"There is a plugin for AfterShot Pro that you can download and install called ""zFrame"". According to its description this plug-in draws up to five frames around an image. Each frame can be set with different size and color. I haven't used it so I can say how well it works or how robust it is. From just the description it seems to have limited capabilities, especially when compared against the Framing feature in PaintShop Pro. I don't know what you mean by a ""background program"" so I can't address that part of your question."
5461,yes/no,B006WVR9GY,Is this 64 bit Windows 7 compatible software?,Y,"Yes it is. I use it with Win7, 64bit, no problems at all."
5462,open-ended,B006X37P2E,Q: How do we know what version of the software?,,I emailed the seller and asked questions.
5463,yes/no,B006X37P2E,will this update for ICD 10?,?,unknown if there will be an update of the codes

5466,yes/no,B006ZF5W1Q,Can I post the tree onto a personal website page?,?,"You can sync (upload) to ancestry.com and make it a private tree, meaning that only those you invite can see (they may need to have an ancestry account, not sure if it has to be a paying account). You can also export to a gedcom file, but would still need to have some type of software to open it. Lastly, you could use the ""publish"" function to create a variety of charts (ex: pedigree, descendent, etc) or word type documents, but these will have a limited number of people and information on them. You can also use the publish function to create a ""book"" which you can actually have published via My Canvas. I believe you can invite people to see the online versions, but am not positive."

5506,open-ended,B0076PO526,- Is this item easy to use?,,"Mr. Tantillo, I say it is easier than older database systems, but it is powerful and has a learning curve that can get very steep at times. The starter solutions would probably help get you started but you will have to educate yourself to many of its features. If you are familiar with scripting and design this program makes any task easy. but don't get into this if you are a true novice. Paul"
5507,yes/no,B0076PO526,This product ships from Japan. Will my menus etc be in Japanese?,N,I can't say. I would not personally purchase an older version of the product. You're better off getting a license for the latest version. http://cimbura.com/tech/2013/10/18/filemaker-licensing-made-easy/
5508,open-ended,B0076PO526,If bought in amazon.com can it be used outside of the U.S.?,,"Yes, I think so...If you want multiple copies you are better off purchasing a volume license directly from FileMaker or an FileMaker Business Alliance partner in your area.

5512,open-ended,B0076PO526,Can i transfer a database from Access to FileMaker 12 or any other version of this program??,,"I transferred a DB from Omnis which is another database system, but I am sure you can also from Access. You just have to export the file and then import it into FileMaker. I usually use 'Tab-Delimited' export format (one of the common export options). Tab-Delimited will allow you to have commas and dashes and most special characters in your fields. FileMaker will create a DB with your fields when you import in the order they are exported. The only thing you might have to do is to go through each field and make the date type fit your data otherwise most fields will be considered text. Also, you might have to enter a name for each field. I was unfamiliar with FileMaker 12 when I bought it, but it only took me about 2 days (maybe 3 hours total work) to set up my DB and even build a screen that displayed the data the way I wanted it to appear."

How is this different from the other FileMaker Pro v.12 offerings?",,"Note: This is a single user copy of FileMaker, not a volume license...so it has no protection for new versions that come out.

5516,open-ended,B0077D8WXA,How many computers can the eBook Publisher be download to? Please say two :),,"This depends on whether you were required to purchase this program with a single computer license or a multi-computer license. If it was not mentioned then chances are you can download it as many times as you want to providing you still have access to it if it was an online purchase, if you bought the program on cd, then you should be able to download it onto as many computers as you wish, but I would always do the downloads from which ever location (IP address) you registered your software from. :), Hope this helps."

5518,open-ended,B0077D8WXA,It appears this will not work with WordPerfect X6. Where can I get the ebook publisher for WP X6?,,"I think you can only get it included with WP X7. I called Corel, asking about the add-on and they sent me to a non-existent page. Methinks the ebook publisher is no longer available because it is included in SP7"

5521,yes/no,B0077SLG56,"Is this compatible with Windows 8? Most programs are not, even though they say they can be installed as an older version.",Y,Yes it is. That's what I'm using it on.
5522,open-ended,B0077SLG56,how would you download photos from cameras,,The photos should be put saved on an SD card and then onto your computer.

5525,yes/no,B0077SLG56,Can you crop pictures with this item?,?,"its been a while and my copy is an older version, but i was really impressed with this software. not only can it crop, as far as slide shows are concerned it can do a ""dynamic crop"". for instance you can start with a photo of a young girl .. then zoom in to show only her new braces .. or you can start with an eyelash then slowly zoom out to expose the entire image .. in one case i used it to show my entire graduating class. it started with the left most few people then slowly moved along the photo (panned) showing more people until the end. a beautiful way to show a lot of information .. if you want to show a cropped image you can do that without even altering the picture itself .. it can also do fade in/ fade out and many other transitions. it can even save your original images in a special file so people can have them printed or send them to others. you might think this is very complex software and it is but they have managed to make it very usable and easy to figure out. just play with it for a while and i think you will be as amazed as i was .. for serious photo editing i use gimp or other very nice and complete photoshop like editing engines ..use those if you want to put your head on a body builders body. use Photostudio Expressions to make a really neat slide show DVD of it."
5526,yes/no,B0077SLG56,Is this a good software for importing photos from my digital camera... and is it compatible with Windows 8 OS? Thanks,?,Dont know specifics

5528,yes/no,B0077SLG56,I just need to turn a digital photo into a jpeg photo...can I do this w/ this software?,?,"Hello...You can as long as your files to convert ends with .bmp, .tga, .pcx , .tif or tiff. I'm not sure about anything else. Hope this helps."
5529,open-ended,B0077SLG56,What can you do if you need to reinstall this program? Thanks.,,Go to amazon and click in your accounts. There is an area where you store your downloaded files just click and reinstall. I saved mine to my computer but it is a hassle to reinstall from there so I just look for it in my amazon account. Hope this helps.
5530,yes/no,B0077SLG56,can you make collages with this program,?,Its a very simple program and I couldn't figure that out. Haven't used it much.

5533,open-ended,B0077UGGQI,Do you ship the software physically or is it a download? Does it work on Windows 8?,,I ordered this a few months back and they shipped a physical copy to me. By the way it's a great program and fun as well.
5534,open-ended,B0077UGGQI,For the Mac version: Does this software run on a PowerPC (OSX 10.4) or does it require an Intel Mac?,,It runs on an Intel Mac.
5535,yes/no,B0077UGGQI,Will this work with a Roland TD-6V and a MacBook Air running Yosemite?,?,"I have a TD-6V that this works great with, and a MAC. However my MAC is older and I am not running Yosemite. So I cant answer the mac part, but the TD-6V is good to go."
5536,open-ended,B0077UGGQI,"Hello, Interested in getting this for my Yamaha DTX 522. Will it be compatible do you know? Thanks",,It's only compatable with v drums.
5537,yes/no,B0077UGGQI,Does the Roland DT-1: V-Drums Tutor run on the Windows Version 7 Operating System?,Y,"Yes, I am running it on Windows 7."
5538,open-ended,B0077UGGQI,Does anyone know how to make this program fullscreen?,,Sadly I don't have the software installed on my Laptop any longer. It did not run full screen on that unit. But on my Surface it runs full screen no problem. If you have to go into properties and see if you can tell it to run at full screen.
5539,open-ended,B0077UGGQI,Does this only work on Roland Drums or can I use others (like Yamaha Drums),,"The user manual says this software is ""specifically designed for V-Drums; compatible with any Roland V-Drums kit."" However, some users have reported on various forums that it works with Yamaha kits."
5540,yes/no,B0077UGGQI,Will this run under Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite?,?,I am sorry I am a PC not a MAC But if you call Roland they can tell you the correct version that does run on the MAC. I know the one I have has a MAC installer but with your version I would hate to say yes and be wrong and have you pay for something you cannot use. CAGMisfits
5541,yes/no,B0079KJ64A,can I install this on both my computers?,?,"Check the Scrivener web site for their latest policy for installing on multiple computers. I'm pretty sure if you buy for multiple operating systems, you'll have to pay separately."
5542,open-ended,B0079KJ64A,how do i do updates with scrivener,,"If you have the Mac App Store version, updates are taken care of through the store. If you bought the program elsewhere (like on Amazon), you can go to the Scrivener--&gt;Check for Updates menu option. Also, in the Preferences (General pane), you can tell the program to automatically check for updates at a specified interval."
5543,open-ended,B0079KJ64A,"Has anyone had trouble with this crashing? Are back-ups easy? Any auto-save options? I'd love to use this, but I am terrified of losing information.",,"I haven't had a problem with crashing and backing up is simple. Also an auto save that refreshes every few minutes, so even if you forget, the program doesn't. It's a great program but does require a learning curve - but hey! doesn't everything? The really nice thing is the ability to have everything - links, thoughts, previous versions, character descriptions, timelines, etc. all in one place that is easily accessible."
5544,open-ended,B0079KJ64A,What software/file formats does it import to/export from?,,"I write in MS Word, and use Scrivener to convert to into mobi (kindle) format. I just copy and paste each chapter in. It will also give you PDF, EPUB and others. I know of some writers who write directly into Scrivener. It has tools to help you track characters and other continuity issues. You can also plan out the story omit, like a storyboard used in film making."
5545,yes/no,B0079KJ64A,"does it edit spelling and punctuation, run on sentences etc?",?,"I've only used it for a few months and have just gotten by the learning curve, but Scrivener makes just a few auto corrections on it's own. However, that is a refreshing break from Word's incessant formatting and self-correcting when you don't want something rewritten, i.e. dialogue in a strange dialect or outlines. Scrivener will alert you to mispells, grammar screw-ups, et al with highlighted words and phrases, but you have to fix most of them yourself. i'm not sure about run on sentences yet. I am starting to like it better than Word, solely as a word processor. Learning curve is short, when in doubt, Google it."
5546,yes/no,B0079KJ64A,can i TRANSFER TO ANOTHER MAC,N,I don't see why not. Once purchased you should be able to download the app from Amazon's servers to your new mac and use the same activation code that you originally obtained from Amazon.
5547,yes/no,B0079KJ64A,"Does it allow photos, pictures mixed in with text?",Y,"Yes. Scrivener allows you to put a ""placeholder"" in your document that will allow you to compile the image into the document after it's printed. Go to GwenHernandez.com. She is a Scrivener expert and has an entire blogpost on how to do this."
5548,yes/no,B0079KJ64A,Does the PC Windows version require Microsoft Office Word?,Y,"I don't believe so. I have Scrivener for both Mac and Windows (two computers). Now, I have Word on the PC, but my impression is that Scrivener doesn't use it. Scrivener stores files in rtf, and then converts them to other file formats as requested. At least, that's what I understand it to be doing. So it should function just fine without Word. If you need to be sure, I would suggest downloading a trial version before buying."
5549,open-ended,B0079KJ64A,I am now using Scrivener for PC but I have a new MAC. Can I export the PC file directly to the MAC? Is there an easier way to do it?,,"Not sure on this, but you can try their customer support site, they are really good about answering questions. I believe they are compatible from hearsay, but have not done it personally. I do know you'll have to install Scrivener for Mac on your new machine, but the files should go over easy."
5550,open-ended,B0079KJB54,no of licenses,,"The short answer is: ""When you purchase a licence for Scrivener, you automatically receive what we call a ""household"" licence for the platform you selected. What we mean by this is as follows: You can install and run Scrivener on any machines you own and of which you are the predominant user. You can install and run Scrivener on any machines based predominantly in your house and used by family members living with you. This only applies to machines running the platform covered by your licence (you cannot use a Mac serial number with the Windows version or vice versa, because the Mac and Windows versions are separate development efforts)."" Go to: Literature and Latte technical support: http://www.literatureandlatte.com/support.php Scroll about half way down to ""Multiple Registrations and Activation."" After reading that, click the link in that section ""registering multiple computers"" (http://scrivener.tenderapp.com/help/kb/purchasing-and-installation/can-i-use-my-license-on-more-than-one-computer) and read the above quote and a few limitations - some of which do not make any sense to me. For example, ""If your child is living away at university then he or she will need a separate license"" and ""If you own a laptop and a desktop, your husband (or wife, or partner) owns a laptop and your daughter has a desktop in her room, and all those machines are running Windows, then you just need a single Windows license."" These seem to me to be mutually exclusive - unless the daughter is excluded from the family, i.e., husband and wife can active their copies and take their laptops where ever but the daughter can't? Or are they tracking the number of laptops activated? If tracking by IP address, I assume any activation at ""home"" would be allowed, absent multiple laptop issues. Whatever the case, it seems to me that an entire household can active separate copies without much objection - and - there are workarounds if multiple laptop activations are required. Finally, you will notice on the support page that it states, ""Note that in some rare cases, you may exceed the activation limit through normal usage. If you feel your usage of the program is within the bounds set forth in the licence agreement, or suspect that your serial number has been compromised, contact us via e-mail so we can sort out your incident and get your software installed again."" It seems to me that they are willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt should activation issues ensue. I activated a desktop and laptop without any issues. Post back if you have other questions. Ed"
5551,yes/no,B0079KJB54,can I return this,?,"Try the free to try for 30 days version at Literatureandlatte.com, That way you can see if you like it and it works for you."
5552,yes/no,B0079KJB54,The current version of Scrivener is 1.7.2.0 (Windows 8.1). Is this the version I will receive purchasing through Amazon? Thank you kindly.,?,When ever you click download it will give you what ever the current version is. The company will give you updates to fix bugs or add or improve on features. This isn't a program where once you download it you're stuck with that version while newer customers are getting a better product. Everyone will have the same version no matter when they bought it. I highly recommend this program for any writers out there. Do not over think it just click that download program.
5553,yes/no,B0079KJB54,"Does the word processing have ""page breaks"" (needed to write for an Ebook)?",Y,Yes. Page breaks are easily incorporated. The program also will compile directly into formats for Kindle and/or Nook.
5554,yes/no,B0079KJB54,Can you import word 2010 documents and if so how smoothly?,?,It imports documents from all the versions of Word that I have ( including 2010) with no problem whatsoever.
5555,yes/no,B0079KJB54,Will Scrivener for Windows run on a Kindle Fire?,N,No. I wish it would. Windows computers or Apple computers only.
5556,open-ended,B0079KJB54,"I have part of my manuscript already on MS Word. Can I transfer it to Scrivener (copy and paste, or? ) ?",,"Yes. Scrivener is divided into three sections that cannot be deleted: Draft, Research, Trash. I tend to follow the Hero's Journey scheme for fiction and I rename the Draft folder to Manuscript. I then create sub-folders named after each of the scheme's divisions, e.g. ordinary world, crossing the first threshold, test, approach to the innermost cave, etc. Within each division I create yet other sub-directories in which I create various scenes, etc., etc., etc. Given that your composition is, in part, complete you have the option of pasting as a single block or you can break it up into chapters, scenes, incomplete ideas, a chunk of dialogue here or there, or as Act 1, Act 2, Act 3 - whatever - and place each part in its respective folder. When you complete your composition, Scrivener (at your command) automatically compiles the parts into manuscript form as you have arranged them in your folders/sub-folders. The beauty of this is that, at any time, you can arrange and rearrange the various scenes or chapters by dragging them to wherever you like within your composition without copy/paste actions. But yes, you can simply copy and paste your entire composition into one folder and utilize Scrivener's outlining capability and add to it ad lib. Ed"
5557,open-ended,B0079KJB54,"how and where do I activate it? I went to the address you give, which do I pick? I'm not paying for a temporary software. please help.",,when you purchase this software you should receive an email with your activation key.
5558,open-ended,B0079KJB54,What is the best way to buy this software as a Christmas gift?,,online for downloas. the online tutorial is awesome & makes writer want to get started immediately!
5559,open-ended,B0079KJB54,"I have an iMac Apple computer, which program should I use?",,I use a PC. Scrivener was originally developed for the MAC and it gets raves. I love it on PC but apparently it can do much more on the MAC. I don't know anything about other programs nor the iMac.
5560,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,I have a Mac. Does this software work on it?,Y,"From the Rootsmagic website: Do RootsMagic, Personal Historian, Family Atlas, or your other products run on a Mac? Yes - but with help. In fact, we have many happy Mac users of our software. However, all of our software is currently designed to run on Windows operating systems. That's where ""the help"" comes in. What do you mean by ""Help""? All Macs built since 2006 use the same microprocessors as Windows PCs. This means that you can install the Windows operating system on your Mac and run any Windows software. There area also other non-Windows options available. How do I install Windows on my Mac? There are three products available that allow you to install Windows on your Mac: Apple Boot Camp, Parallels Desktop, and VMWare Fusion. There are also apps for ipad and related and android devices."
5561,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,can you use gedcom files,Y,"Yes, but I would be careful. The reason I didn't continue with Roots Magic was that all my gedcom files did not transfer. I had a lot of information in my files other than the basic birth, death etc....things of that nature. If you don't have a lot of notes, it should be okay. If you are like me and have a lot of notes etc. then I would be wary."
5562,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,"I'll be getting a new computer with Windows 8, will this work on it?",?,Thank you for your question. The Roots Magic website states that their software is Windows 8 compatible. http://www.rootsmagic.com/RootsMagic/ Platform: Windows Windows 8 / 7 / Vista / XP / 2000
5563,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,Currently I use Family Tree Maker 2006. Will I be able to import my files to Roots Magic 6?,Y,Yes you can according to Roots Magic you can import data directly from Family Tree Maker
5564,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,I have the version 4 book. Is the version 6 book necessary?,?,I decided to purchase version 6 with the book. I know it comes without the book as well. Since I am new to Rootsmagic I neeeded the manual. If you are familiar with Rootsmagic you probably don't require the manual.
5565,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,I have a Excell spreadsheet I have built that has family history. Can this be downloaded in this software?,N,"I am pretty sure the answer is no, as most genealogy programs are built on the gedcom standard, which is a database. There is nothing on the rootsmagic help mentioning excel. You might be able to cut and paste information from your excel file to a rootsmagic person note, but I can't see anyway to automate the data entry process. You could contact the rootsmagic author Bruce Busby (sic) for his input."
5566,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,Is it compatible with Windows 7 ?,?,"Yes it is compatible with Windows 7. I do highly recommend getting the book too, it's well worth it. This program greatly surpasses any other type program is every way. Other programs have so many different verions depending on what you are doing which costs lots of money, but with Roots Magic it's one program to buy and does more than any other program. Very easy to use and it also comes with Roots Magic Go program, in which it allows you to put it on a flash drive to use when researching information at the library or other places where you cannot take the documents with you."
5567,open-ended,B0079L2OQG,Since downloading Roots Magic 6 It does not interact with the LDS Family Search Program. My friend is having the same program. What can we do to fix,,I am sorry I am not able to help with that question. I had no problem with that part when I had RM 6 installed. I would recommend contacting Roots Magic at This link: http://rootsmagic.com/help. They were very pleasant and willing to help when I did. They also were quick to respond. I didn't have to wait days for a response.
5568,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,Is this a stand-alone program similar to Ancestry.com or does it work WITH Ancestry?,?,RootsMagic 6 is a stand alone program and has nothing to do with Ancestry.com. Ancestry.com is a genealogy resource in helping you find ancestors.
5569,yes/no,B0079L2OQG,does this make websites?,Y,Yes
5570,open-ended,B007BG9X3Q,Is this a download or boxed version?,,"This is a boxed version. However, you can go to Adobe's website and download a free 30 day trial.

5591,open-ended,B007BG9VLK,What is the difference between LR4 and elements 11?,,"Too many to address here. The short answer is that if you edit images one at a time and only need basic cataloguing capability, get Elements. It is very good image editor. On the other hand, if you need to be able to process, caption, keyword and catalogue large numbers of images simultaneously, get Lightroom. Lightroom handles 90% + of my processing needs, but lacks a few filters and layer features that Elements has that I find useful, so I use both. If I had to only own one, it would be Lightroom without question. Once you learn catalogue management it is a great program, and I really love that adjusted images don't have to be saved. Lightroom saves the adjustment recipe for each image, and these can be tweaked indefinitely without affecting the original image file or necessitating saving a copy of the adjusted image (this helps keep file management very clean and neat without multiple copies of images floating around). If you can only own one, best to download trial versions of both and try them before you buy. Most of the techniques you learn in one package will carry over fairly well to the other, so you won't be wasting much time if you decide against one on which you've invested time."

That said, Lightroom 5 is now in Beta testing and will be released sometime in the next very few months. I would wait for that. LR5 will contain some actions that currently have to be accomplished by going out of LR into either Photoshop, Elements, or some other program. For the price, Lightroom is so far superior to anything else I can think of that I'd certainly upgrade. Besides, you'll get a price break since you already own LR2."
5593,open-ended,B007BG9VLK,"how many pc's can this product be used on, such as i installed it on laptop and i want it on desktop also",,Yes you can legally install it on YOUR laptop and desktop both. If you ever take it off of one make sure tyou ust the programs uninstall.

My suggestion is to contact the support team, by using their ""chat"" box. Someone should be able to help you right away. I've had a few questions in the past and always got help from someone at the tech dept. You can also check youtube. There are plenty of tutorials regarding video studio pro x topics."
5626,yes/no,B007GFNPFY,does this allow language selection during installation?,?,I'm afraid I don't remember - it's been almost a year since we installed it.
5627,yes/no,B007GFNPFY,"I am looking for a video editor software to edit DVD's, will this work?",Y,"Have been using the program successfully. Have had no problems with it, but there was a steeper learning curve than many programs to learn. Purchased book by marc bech to help me understand the program. One of the other reviewers recommended backing program on a regular basis to avoid losing work. A simpler program would be available from Applian Technologies, although it doesn't have the many capabilities as VideoStudio Pro."
5628,yes/no,B007GFNPFY,"Hello, I live in Ukraine. If I buy VideoStudio Pro X5 Ultimate, can I recive Russian language version?",?,"Yes.

As I said, I have no idea about Mac compatibility. Good luck!"
5637,yes/no,B007H083NC,can I print the screen without saving it,Y,Yes you can snag anything to the editor the print and easily X out of that snagged image. You can play with profiles as well I bet to even make that easier
5638,yes/no,B007H083NC,Can SnagIt capture text and let me edit it,?,"SnagIt cannot capture the actual letters in the text. It can capture a screen print of the text. If you could copy the actual text, you could also paste it into a SnagIt text box and edit it (but if you can do that, you can already paste it anywhere and edit it). So the short answer is, no."

5650,yes/no,B007H38SY8,Can this be used on smartphones and tablets ?,?,I believe it's only for pc's
5651,yes/no,B007H38SY8,I was told my computer is badly infected. Don't have the money to get it fixed. Will this get rid of prior viruses?,?,It has worked for me. Sometimes it might be good to go through it using the software twice
5652,yes/no,B007H38SY8,may you use one program on own laptop and desktop,?,I don't think so. The instructions indicate that it only works on one computer.
5653,open-ended,B007H38SY8,can this be installed on more than 1 pc and is it for 32 or 64 bit,,I was able to install it on 2 computers because I had the CD but technically its suppose to be for only one computer according to the package. When I set up the account on one computer and installed on the second I just signed in with the account I made and it never recognized that I had it on two computers. I really like this product though. So I would still recommend it.
5654,open-ended,B007HCU8QK,"Does it work with PAL, or only NTSC?",,"it works with either, just have to go into settings to switch between the two."
5655,yes/no,B007HCU8QK,Can I plug it into my tv and record a show?,?,"If your TV has composite Video and Audio out capability, it may work. You still need a computer , the software and a USB capture device. Better stuff available."
5656,open-ended,B007HCU8QK,I don't have a VHS recorder and they are hard to find . Can anyone tell me where I can purchase one ?,,"Go to a goodwill store or thrift store. U will find one... Or go on craigslist and out an add in for ""wanted"""
5657,yes/no,B007HCU8QK,DOES THIS WORK WITHOUT A CAMCORDER?,?,I do not have a camcorder but the manual for the software states that it can be used with a camcorder.
5658,yes/no,B007HCU8QK,do this work with windows 8,?,Can't say. Have not used it with Win 8
5659,open-ended,B007HCU8QK,Where do the CD' s come out of?,,The disc is recorded via a connecting cable into your computer cd/DVD drive.
5660,yes/no,B007HCU8QK,does it read 8mm tapes,N,Not that I am aware of.
5661,yes/no,B007HCU8QK,Does this convert 8mm VHS to dvd?,?,If you have the proper cables (sold separately). This is the software only to capture the video to your pc and burn it to DVD (DVD Burner also required!)
5662,yes/no,B007HCU8QK,is it easy to use,Y,"It is reasonably easy to use, however the manual leaves a lot to be desired and needs a lot of work. You have to figure out a lot of things yourself but once determined it is easy to use!"
5663,open-ended,B007HCU8QK,"a. how does this work, with a computer? does it downgrade the quality?",,I have been using it with a Windows 7 machine and so far have found no degradation in the quality of the video transferred and copied to a CD. I have transferred 8 VHS tapes so far with great resolution!
5664,yes/no,B007HNWJIO,Can you print checks from this software?,N,"No, check printing is not possible-nor desirable, really-for this simple but essential piece of software. It very capably does what no other app can do: let you know when bills are due, how much money you'll need for upcoming expenses, and a history of what was paid and when. This is not a bookkeeping program like ""Quicken,"" but it does exactly what it says it does, and does it well."
5665,yes/no,B007HNWJIO,can you transfer quicken files and keep a check book with this item,?,"No, this is not a money management tool in that sense. But it does one thing well, better than Quicken or any other app: records who you owe, when it's due, and when and how much was paid, with alerts and reminders and such as needed. Frankly that's the only thing that was missing in my money management arsenal. Nothing else gives me-quickly, with no fuss-a snapshot of exactly how much needs to be paid out. A great app."
5666,yes/no,B007HNWJIO,does it have checkbook entries and deposits,N,"No, it doesn't"
5667,yes/no,B007I7HEIO,Does this disk dual boot?,Y,"yes it does. That's the way I used it at first. This is the best version of Linux you can buy, IMO. A friend of a friend who is a Linux guru said the same thing. Worth every dime."
5668,yes/no,B007I7HEIO,Will thi work on an HP Netbook?,Y,"yes it will. i have an hp laptop and i installed, dual boot, with windows 7. its a great operating system."
5669,yes/no,B007I7HEIO,can you download TAILS on this operating system?,?,ask the same question on Google search I'm not that multiple of net Linux
5670,open-ended,B007I7HEIO,"I would like to try Linux. Can someone please tell me the easiest Linux to learn. Not very good with computes.. Thank you, John",,just go for the latest distro - 16
5671,yes/no,B007I7HEIO,Will this work on an older computer with Windows xp,?,Ya should work.
5672,yes/no,B007IWCWFE,Can you use this as an upgrade if I have CorelDraw Graphics SuiteX3?,?,My X6 box says you need to have X4 or X5. Sometimes you can call Corel and they can help you upgrade with a later version. Or find a cheap X4 and then go on from there. I did that for Painter.
5673,yes/no,B007IWCWFE,I have use photoshop in the past to creative black and white drawings of metal sign designs. Would I be able to do this with product?,Y,"When my husband and I had our website, we used Corel Draw Graphics Suite exclusively. I was able to design signs, stationery, business cards, etc. I recommend it highly. It is a true high end software, and worth every penny."
5674,open-ended,B007IWCWFE,I have the X4 full version. Can I buy this X6 Suite Upgrade? Or I must have el X5 version to buy this upgrade?,,"As long as you have a version of Corel installed on your computer, you can upgrade. it doesn't matter if the versions are in sequence."
5675,yes/no,B007IWCWFE,Is this the full version?,?,You need X4 or X5 to use the X6 Upgrade.
5676,open-ended,B007IWCWFE,What versions of Corel are available for upgrade - i have an old version that doesn't work with my Win 7 upgrade,,You can upgrade from x4 or x5 but not including academic versions
5677,yes/no,B007IWCWFE,Will the upgrade work with windows 8?,?,"I only had CD6 for about a week (and never opened it) - I had tried to use the demo one with Win7 and didn't like it so I sent the package back (I don't remember now what I didn't like but I use CorelDraw X5 with my business and Windows 7 on all my computers and have not had the desire to switch to Win8 (it just looks more like a toy than something I need for production) and I keep all my computers with the same OS if at all possible. So, in answer to your question, I'm really not the one to ask on either question. Hope you find out."
5678,open-ended,B007IWCXHG,"The latest OS you are listing is Windows 7. However, on the Corel website X6 Graphics Suite X6 is listed as Windows 8 compatible. Please advise.",,It is Windows 8 compatible. The Corel website confirms it.
5679,yes/no,B007IWCXHG,will this work on the windows professional format?,?,I'm running Win7Pro and it runs fine on it.
5680,yes/no,B007IWCXHG,One last question before I pull the trigger. Does this version leave a watermark on the finished image?,?,I've never seen one. I've been using this version for almost a year.
5681,open-ended,B007IWCXHG,"Which program has more features, CorelDRAW Suite X6 Graphics Education Edition or CorelDRAW Suite X6 Graphics Home and Student Edition?",,"If you qualify, get the Education Edition. It has all features of the standard edition. The Home and Student Edition has *almost* complete versions of CorelDRAW and Corel PHOTO-PAINT but some features are missing. The Home and Student Suite does not include many OpenType features or color management options. The Home and Student Suite does not include VBA / VSTA or Macros. The Home and Student Suite does not include PrePress, PreFlight, several of the file formats in the other versions. Note that if you are already a Paintshop Pro user, PSP cannot read the .CPT files generated by PhotoPaint and vice versa. Corel has about the best file format translators in the industry. This file format shortcoming is the only one I've found in the entire Corel lineup and it is disappointing."
5682,yes/no,B007IWCXHG,WILL IT WORK WITH WINDOWS 8.1?,Y,Yes
5683,open-ended,B007IWCXHG,How many users can use this version? I am interested in purchasing this for my university lab. I need to install it on at least 5 lab computers.,,You can only put It on three computers and the student version is the same but if you buy the academic version for schools it costs much less. If you buy one you can put it on three computers for $99 and if you want it on six computers it will cost about $189 and can be bought for that price through Corel.com. Am not sure if Amazon carries that version or not but probably does.
5684,open-ended,B007IWCXHG,what is the difference between the education edition and the original edition?,,"According to tech support, the education edition always puts a watermark on the graphics you create, because Corel doesn't want you to be able to make any money on your student drawings. If you use want to use to sell your graphics, you have to buy the full version. Again, this is what tech support said when I called them."
5685,yes/no,B007IWCXHG,Does it include the tracing tool?,Y,Yes
5686,yes/no,B007IWCXHG,Will it run on a 64bit system/,Y,yes
5687,open-ended,B007IWCXHG,Can this program do a few of the basic things? Does it have templates for labels and business cards? Is there clip art? Can I design greeting cards?,,"It does much more than basic things. It comes with clipart and templates, yes for business cards, no for labels. Unless you are doing professional greeting cards (there are no templates with this particular version), you could look to Print Shop which is designed to all all the things you asked about although it is not nearly as powerful as CD. Hope this helps. God bless and Merry Christmas."
5688,open-ended,B007JPMZDE,How does it work? Dear Kenney or Ollie...Do I need midi-cables from Finale to my keyboard and my computer? Thanks for your help...Ed,,"You select a template, a key, a time signature. Then you go over to the left margin and select a note (either a whole, half, quarter, etc.) Put your cursor on the line or space where you want that note and click. When you have your whole song, you can transpose it into any key. Your midi icon will play it back so you can correct mistakes. Time consuming but very easy. I love it."
5689,yes/no,B007JPMZDE,"With this software,can my music be entered directlly to the staff as I play.If not what program would I need?",Y,"You can have the music appear instantly if your instrument, such as a keyboard, has the midi function. You can also import and export midi and xml files that are recorded on other programs or downloaded from online. I prefer to create my music in the Magix Music Maker Premium program and then export it to Finale SongWriter to create the sheet music. But that's just a personal choice; everyone is different and has different needs."
5690,yes/no,B007JPMZDE,can I record a demo with this program?,?,"if you want to play the demo, you can connect he midi cable to a keyboard and computer and copy the notes that you play using Songwriter. If you want to record music someone else has played you need to use another audio recording software and a PC microphone connected to computer. if you want to record and make corrections use a DAW, such as, Studio One, Pro Tools etc."
5691,yes/no,B007JPMZDE,Can I install this on both of my computers?,?,I tried to install it on a friend's computer (besides mine) and I think it got rejected. You might try calling the Music Finale people and see if they can walk you through it.
5692,open-ended,B007JPMZDE,"what instruments does the finale songwriter 2012 let you write for, how many?",,"Finale Songwriter can be used with any instrument that plays treble and bass standard staff music..ie, keyboards, winds, strings , harmonicas ."
5693,open-ended,B007JPMZDE,I write simple songs on my guitar and piano (I am a beginner with both). Is this software worthwhile for me or is it for more intermediate writers?,,As long as you take the time to review the instructions you should have no problem. It is actually better for the beginner than for expert arrangers (because it only has 8 staves per sheet); although intermediates can get good use out of it as well.
5694,yes/no,B007JPMZDE,Would this work for a computer literate 9-year-old who just needs a way to write down the scores for songs he composes on the keyboard?,Y,Anyone should be able to use this software. It would be a great help if you are able to read music.
5695,yes/no,B007JPMZDE,does the instrumentation include a generous offering from the indian orchestra plus the hammered dulcimer?,?,"Buzmeg, I had this software to write lead sheets but it was too slow. There were too many operations you had to do just to add a note to the score. It does not offer anything it only will creat a musical lead sheet if you read and can understand what they are trying to say. your question has to be answered by one of their techs. Just call them and they will help you and answer your questions. Only those guy s know the answer to your question, Not me and not Amazon. Sorry that I can't help you. You'll end up returning the item and call Kelly's TV. Amazon has their number and there is a lady there that will put you on the right Software. Company.Peter Skelton"
5696,open-ended,B007JPMZDE,what year is it?,,copyright 2012
5697,yes/no,B007JPMZDE,Can the music have guitar chords added at the top?,?,"Yes, it can--I do not do so but. . .. Your manual is hardly clear about anything and then usually inaccurate, lacking in necessary ""essential"" details, or just not relevant to using the program. But what the manual does contain is a service number: telephone them and they are amazingly ""present"" and willing to walk anyone--this techno-dinosaur included--through some of the most difficult of exercises. The result is always equal to the expected high quality of the Finale line. As someone who works in ethnomusicology however, my world of sound requires a few more options--like following Glass or the Kronos Quartet-like composition, or better yet, having an extended list of instrumentation (say, for Asian instrumentation, e.g., gamellin (sp), the Korean horizontal flute, etc.). I can dream. But as I do so, do call the customer service agent for Finale. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. JAW"
5698,open-ended,B007MF77R0,"is this an ""upgrade"" version? does this version need to see an earlier version on the computer I put it on?",,"No, This verson is the full blown original install. No previous install required."

5702,open-ended,B007MF77R0,Does this version have a multiple or single use licensing?,,Single
5703,open-ended,B007MF77R0,Why does this cost more than AutoCAD LT 2013? Is it because it works more reliably?,,"Not sure I understand the question. We are talking about 2013 lt, correct? Is your question why does 2013 lt cost less than 2013 non lt?"
5704,yes/no,B007MF77R0,Does LT come with any electrical symbols to use on drawings?,Y,Yes
5705,yes/no,B007MF77R0,"Does Amazon honor the ""AutoCAD LT New License Promotion offer"" through 3/25 as a reseller?",Y,Yes
5706,yes/no,B007MF77R0,Is this program good for Structural Drafting such as Concrete Reinforcing Steel???,Y,Yes it is the universal drafting program. Consider debit if your clients use it.

I would think this holds true back to the very earliest of versions. I just opened a file which was created in 1996 without any difficulty and this was probably created in DOS Version 5, before Windows was even invented! Based on this, there is no known reason to me why you couldn't open any file created in any previous Windows version and I have done that in the past with older Windows versions. To my knowledge every Word Perfect file has a ""wpd"" extension and that holds true with the Word Perfect Office X6 files. Unlike Microsoft, which has had various extensions over the years, Word Perfect has retained the same extension for more than 20 years and probably more than 30 years. I am currently working in Windows 8.1. John"

5743,yes/no,B007QYZ08A,"I only have Note Pad and Word Pad, I want a better program for writing with spell and grammar check. Will this program work for that?",Y,"Yes. Wordperfect is a full up ""word processing"" program, and includes spell check and grammer checking, without some of the bells, whistles and folderol which accompanies Word. I think the transition will be simple enough, but then, I started with WP when it was WordStar."
5744,yes/no,B007QYZ08A,will it run on windows 8,Y,Yes
5745,open-ended,B007QYZ08A,Wordperfect and compatibility with Windows 8???,,"I purchased Corel WordPerfect Office X6 (Home and Student), because my older version of WP would not save documents with my new Windows 8 Computer.

It is just too much to have to re-enter.,Y,"The conversion will not be perfect by all means. When attempting to convert the files over to Microsoft Word, it worked fine with some paragraphs being broken. But was very manageable since our word documents were at max 20 pages. We have not tried a spreadsheet yet. If it's that big, i'm sure you'll get some problems, but depending on how large it is, might be tedious to fix. And if you have formulas, the affects of porting it over as well would need to be taken into consideration."

5749,open-ended,B007QYZ17A,I have bought this since a year and i still cannot play it on my computer.It`s rubbish.How to make the software play on my computer?,,"Hi. Assuming that your computer puts out normal Windows sounds (speakers not muted) and assuming that the Garritan I.O. software is properly installed and activated on your PC, there should be a standalone program called Aria Player on your desktop. When launched, be sure to check TOOLS/PREFERENCES to see if your sound card and format type are listed correctly. If your sound card is not supported, you can download freeware called 'ASIO4ALL' -Also check that your midi keyboard or other trigger device is selected to input notes. If you have no such devices, you can use the on-screen keyboard that comes with the product. To test sound output, load up an ""ensemble"" and click on the highlighted keys to see what you get.

Express: SQL Server 2012 Express edition is an entry-level, free database that is ideal for learning and building desktop and small server data-driven applications. Ref: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/get-sql-server/how-to-buy.aspx I like developers as I get the management tools and full db capabilities like on an full version (mostly)."
5813,yes/no,B007RFXQAM,Can I download SSDT and use it with this product?,Y,"Yes! In fact I use SSDT all the time with SQL 2012 Developer for demo around the world. In fact SSDT is a built in feature. As you watch this Amazon review pause it at 6:38. You will see the 8th checkbox for ""SQL Server Data Tools"" which is SSDT. I plan to write a Joes 2 Pros book on SSDT later this year and recommend people use SQL Developer. However if you download SSDT from the web site you will get the more updated one then what comes on the DVD. So if you have SQL 2012 already then download the latest SSDT which is free."
5814,yes/no,B007RFXQAM,Does it run on Windows 7 64 bit?,Y,"Yes, I have a Win7 64 bit laptop that i've installed it on. I installed the 64bit version, to take advantage of the 8Gb of RAM on this laptop. the only issue I've had previously (SQL 2005) was with 64bit drivers for Excel files in SSIS, but I think that is fixed now. The work around was to either install the 32bit version of SSIS or to use text files."
5815,open-ended,B007RFXQAM,Statistician needs to mine data using MS_SQL: Is MS SQL Server Developer Edition 2012 the software solution I need to learn / improve my SQL skills?,,"Yes, this is the correct product for learning. SQL Server is extremely powerful - this is a full-blown enterprise class product and you are able to get it essentially at the price of an academic license. It is specifically meant for what you're doing - learning the product. Further, so long as you stick with standard SQL, your skils will also be applicable/transferable to any other SQL DBMS, whether it be Oracle, Sybase, or mysql."

You can install several databases based on the space and machine requirements you may have.
5818,yes/no,B007RFXQAM,I use VMWare fusion to run Windows 8 on my Mac. Can this be installed on my Virtual -Windows 8 on my Mac?,?,"Hi there, If you check SQL2012 specs for Developer edition. Microsoft states it can be installed on Windows 8 64bit Professional and Enterprise, but I have never done that myself. As an alternative, you can easily download a Windows 2008R2 trial version, which is free, and you can install Windows 2008 via VMware fusion and run SQL2012 on top of that. I do also recommend, if you have USB 3.0 ports on your Mac, buy a SSD USB external drive and install your VMs there. The performance is amazing!"
5819,yes/no,B007RFXQAM,can I download this to my laptop I want to practice queries run scripts Im learning SQL,?,"I believe the product comes with physical media. To practice running SQL scripts, I'd recommend the SQL Server Express editiion, which doesn't have all of the tools SSIS/SSAS/SSRS, but should provide a downloadable product to start learning with."

And if so, why?",,"The boxes (or more precisely the box outlines) are not printed on the envelope. They only appear on your computer screen when you are entering the address and return address.

Thank you.",,"Chances are the companies asked you if you wanted their services and you probably didn't notice. When downloading programs off the internet, be careful of the small writing when asking to proceed. Sometimes they will have these programs pre-checked for you and you have to uncheck them in order to not receive their games/search engines. Otherwise, you need to go and delete them manually off your computer."
5863,yes/no,B007SOLCP8,Can you use check stock paper (check at top of page),N,"This program is simply a check register that does the math for you, it also will balance the check register so you can compare to your bank statement. It does not have a check printing feature."

Once I got used to it being on my computer, I shredded my paper check registers. I am a bookkeeper and I really love this program."
5867,yes/no,B007SOLCP8,can you reconcile the account,Y,"Yes you can. Once you receive your bank statement, you simply check off the transactions in the program, which then disappear from view (You can retrieve them easily if needed). At the end, you type in the new account balance from the statement and the program tells if it is accurate. Much easier to balance using the program than manually."

5873,open-ended,B007TMFD7M,Do you have to use a joystick or will the keyboard due to play this game?,,"Your keyboard will work, but's it fairly difficult trying to remember all the key commands. I highly recommend using a joystick over your keyboard though. Even an inexpensive joystick will be a lot more enjoyable. The sim itself has a ton to offer, so if your going to spend the money for the game, do yourself a favor and get a higher end control system. You'll be glad that you did."

5879,open-ended,B007TMFD7M,"Husband is only interested in flying Cessna, is this the best product for this? What accessory is best? Yoke? Which one?",,Some people think that this program is too sensitive. Some think it is closer to the real effect that you would have in an airplane. I am not sure. I also have Flight Simulator X which is not developed anymore by Microsoft. Some people like it better. If he is a real pilot then maybe he would be happy with X-plane. Not sure what to recommend on the yoke.

Can I just put in the micro SD card and it will work on an upcoming trip to New Zealand?,,"You'll need to confirm with Garmon.com that your Nuvi accepts these cards. If so, just insert the card and your Garmin will access it once you land in New Zealand. The card worked great on our extensive road trip last fall to Australia and New Zealand (both islands). I can't imagine driving there without it."

Among the ""60 file types,"" there are many versions of Word, some old versions of WP, WordStar, Quattro Pro, and many many more.

I found I had to install files other than WordPerfect to make it fully functional with Dragon. (Needed to install the ""extras"" -- a file containing clip art and other things I did not think I would use, in order to make WP and Dragon work together.) Perhaps this would also be required on Windows 8 as well. I purchased a machine with Windows 8 on it and promptly set it in a corner, probably never to be used again unless I can ""reverse it"" to Windows 7."
5910,yes/no,B007UM59O8,Does this version let you choose language options in the tools tab that earlier WP versions had so you can type in Spanish and spell check it?,Y,Yes.
5911,open-ended,B007UM59O8,"How does WP Office X6 Standard differ from the Home and Student version? Also, what does it have that X5 doesn't have?",,"The main differences are that Standard has Video Studio Essentials X4 and and Ebook publisher - so the real question is whether either of those programs would be helpful. For my part, the only part of the suite that I use is WordPerfect - too bad they don't sell it as a standalone any more. As far as X5 vs X6 is concerned, the major difference is that X6 allows WordPerfect to be open more than once at the same time. This means that you can use multiple monitors (available since Windows XP) and have easier access to more than one document at a time. Again, though, this isn't as great as it sounds because you can have more than one document open at a time with X5 - you just have to switch back and forth in the same screen. Bottom line...if you use X5 and you're happy with it, you won't notice any significant difference with X6."
5912,open-ended,B007UM59O8,I see that version 16 of WordPerfect Office X6 Standard is compatible with Windows 8 - what version is Amazon selling - it does not say.,,The one I received was version 16.0.0.428.
5913,yes/no,B007UM59O8,will this open and edit .sam ami pro files?,N,"Sorry. Not familiar with that type of file. I see on line however, instructions to convert ami pro files to Word. If you do that then WorsPerfect will open a Word document."
5914,open-ended,B007UM59O8,"hi, i have upgraded my computer several times and now thinking about windows 7. if i get a new computer can i load this software into the new computer?",,I just upgraded my computer and am running Windows 8.1. Did not have any trouble loading and using this program.
5915,open-ended,B007UM59O8,"Is this a full version or just an upgrade, and how many computers may it be installed on?",,"It appears to be a full version, but I would ask the seller. If you don't have a previous version and this is an upgrade it won't work and I believe you must have either the X14 or X15 versions to upgrade. Like I say, ask the seller. As far as how many computers? I have used my full version on two computers and done a half dozen reloads."
5916,yes/no,B007UM59O8,Does this product allow you to put it on multiple computers?,Y,"Yes, I am currently running it on two computers. One at home and one at the office."
5917,open-ended,B007USKULE,"Fritz 14 asks for a 5 group, 5 character ea. activation code . The DVD case has a 6 group, 5 characters ea ""Premium Serial Number"". Need the code.",,"Hi, it is the first string of five- it will work"

5919,yes/no,B007USKULE,Does it require a STEAM account. I don't have any internet band width.,N,No Steam acount is requires. You only need Internet access to register.
5920,yes/no,B007USKULE,"Does Deep Fritz 14 offer tutorials (like ChessMaster does), especially for the more advanced players?",Y,Yes
5921,yes/no,B007USKULE,Does this program point out where you have made a blunder?,Y,"Yes, it has a section called ""Blunder Check""."
5922,yes/no,B007USKULE,Does this program solve chess problems?,Y,Yes
5923,yes/no,B007USKULE,Does this have voice recognition to be able to speak moves in standard chess notation?,?,"I don't see any ""voice recognition"" prompt anywhere, but, that doesn't mean one doesn't exist. I haven't clicked on everything?...www.chessbase.com should give you all the answers you're looking for. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful..."
5924,open-ended,B007USKULE,"Can I use Fritz 13 or Deep Fritz 14 on Windows 8? Also, I don't have a DVD-ROM in my computer so where do I buy a downloaded version of fritz?",,I run my Deep Fritz 14 on Windows 8. As far as a download version you might want to check with Chessbase.com which sells the product and answered my questions when I was looking to purchase the product (which is very good but requires a lot of memory to work effectively).
5925,open-ended,B007USKULE,How much in pounds sterling ?,,Rates fluctuate daily for dollars vs pounds. By today's rate (12/16/13) it is 47.20 pounds.
5926,yes/no,B007USKULE,Is there an update available for Deep Fritz 13?,N,"ChessBase never offers upgrades to their chess engines. So no, there will not be an upgrade, I am sorry."
5927,yes/no,B007V8R6V0,Will it do cloning?,?,"i never tried that, so don't know"
5928,open-ended,B007V8R6V0,what is some easy to use software that will allow me to remove problem areas and retouch,,The photo studio expressions will do that. It is much more user friendly than photoshop elements.
5929,open-ended,B007V8R6V0,This software is for windows 8?,,That's what I use it on
5930,yes/no,B007W76ZLW,"Is there an ""expiration"" date you have to use this 3-month prepaid by? Seems you could buy a year's worth for $400, cheaper than Adobe's 1-yr for $600",?,I used 5 of them for over a year's worth. It's a much better deal!!! They stack and don't seem to have any limitations.
5931,open-ended,B007W76ZLW,"If I purchase this as a gift, can the recipient begin the three months membership at a later date or does the 3 months start upon receipt of the gift?",,"Your membership doesn't start until you register it at Adobe , by providing the key-password"
5932,yes/no,B007W76ZLW,"Is this ""old version"" still valid?",Y,"Yes. Creative Cloud is ongoing and constantly updated, so the redemption is still valid and you get the latest versions available from Creative Cloud."
5933,open-ended,B007W76ZLW,What happened too the effects menu inside the media browser in Premiere Pro CC 2014,,Did you accidentally closed the Effects panel? Switch the workspace to editing and then reset current workspace. That should get them back to factory default.
5934,open-ended,B007W76ZLW,how soon I will be getting the redeem key after completing my purchase?,,"It's a physical card that is shipped to you, so that depends on what shipping speed you select. You scratch off a spot on the back of the card to get the code."
5935,yes/no,B007W76ZLW,Can you use the 3 month prepaid card toward your already existing creative cloud subscription?,?,Yep. That is what I have been using it for. Just make sure you opt out of the auto charge for your current creative cloud account.
5936,open-ended,B007W76ZLW,"will this prepaid subscription be able to be used in countries where the cloud is not yet available? if i reside in a country where the cloud subscription is not available yet, and i purchase this prepaid subscription, will it work for me?",,No cards still must be purchased from an address where the service is available

5952,yes/no,B007WAKJHU,does this run in windows 8.1,?,Sorry. I don't know. I have Windows 7. I would suggest you call the manufacturer and ask them. They were very helpful when I had questions about both the Floor Plan software and other software that I had purchased earlier.
5953,yes/no,B007WIK8YG,"With other CAD programms, you do have to buy a yearly licence. Do you have to buy it also with this CAD programm?",N,"No, I do not remember that requirement, I did send it back as it would not load onto my computer, I have found it wont load other programs either so am looking into the problem."
5954,yes/no,B007WIK8YG,Can one use this program to draw out electrical schematics?,?,Absolutely. You can draw individual components and save them in the library. You can also create different layers to show separate parts of the circuit.
5955,yes/no,B007WIK8YG,Can it create house plans good enough for permitting?,?,"I don't see why not. I have gotten permits with hand drawn plans previously, but purchased this to design, permit and build a pool house. I've done the site plan, floor plan and am just starting the elevations. There is a bit of a learning curve, but the tutorials help quite a bit."

5959,yes/no,B007X5FSHK,Does this course require statistic background?,Y,"I would say that 3 of the 5 days covered by this course assume familiarity with statistics beyond, say, normal distribution parameters such as mean and standard deviation - if that is a guide. It helps if you understand what a T-test is used for, or when you would apply the Poisson distribution. You will still get value from the course without having had a lot of statistics training, but if you want to be a data scientist, you will need a very solid grounding in statistics to get the most from this course. I also suggest you review the open source R statistics package before starting this course."
5960,open-ended,B007X5FSHK,"Does this product allow real lab access or just view the lab demos? If the latter, what are the options for simulating the actual lab environment?",,"In addition to the narrated video recording of each lab exercise, a zipped file of the labs' source code and applicable datasets are provided on the DVD. This zipped file can be found in the Resources section on the Course Menu tab. As stated in an earlier response to this question, you will have to download and install free and open source tools such as R and RStudio. Since you may plan to use these tools after the completing the course, it makes sense to install the latest versions of the software tools directly on your machine. Kate Hutchinson, EMC Education Services"
5961,yes/no,B007X5FSHK,Does this training DVD also include the $200 Voucher to take the EMC Proven Professional Data Science Associate (EMCDSA) Certification Exam?,N,"The VILT does not include the voucher for taking the EMCDSA Certification Exam, however, you can purchase the Exam Voucher through Pearson VUE here: http://www.pearsonvue.com/emc/ Kate Hutchinson EMC Education Services"
5962,open-ended,B007X5FSHK,How many hours of video instruction does this have?,,"There are 25 hours of actual video lecture, but the course itself is designed to take 40 hours when including the data sets/exercises included on the DVD. Kate Hutchinson EMC Education Services"
5963,yes/no,B007X5FSHK,"I would like to buy this but I am in Australia. Can you provide me a way to purchase this and mail it to my Australiahn address?

5964,open-ended,B007X5FSHK,Two questions: (1) How often will this course be revised? (2) How many people have passed the exam and obtained EMCDSA certification to date? Thanks.,,"EMC Education Services periodically reviews its materials to ensure the content is still current. As of July 2013, there are over 200 individuals who have achieved the EMCDSA certification. --Kate Hutchinson, EMC Education Services"
5965,open-ended,B007X5FSHK,"When was this version last updated? I am very interested in ordering it, but if the version is from April 30, 2012, then I would be 1.5 years behind.",,"Not sure if they updated it, i got 2012 version . I liked Nina Zumel's lectures she is writing a book http://www.manning.com/zumel/, i think book covers most of the stuff ."
5966,open-ended,B007X5FSHK,"Has there been any updates to this course recently? Many people have complained about the labs not working? Also, is this good enough for the EMCDSA?",,"Labs are only for the classroom based courses. They don't provide lab access to the online version. I asked couple of times and they didn't accept. Totally agree without the labs the content is not enough. I have done R labs in my own PC, but others don't work."
5967,open-ended,B007X5FSHK,How can I purchase one Voucher?,,"You can purchase a certification exam voucher from the EMC Education Store at http://education.emc.com/store. In the catalog search, use the term ""voucher."""
5968,yes/no,B007X5FSHK,Is it possible for me to order it in Germany?,?,"The course is not available for shipping to Germany from Amazon, however, you can get international shipping if you order from the EMC Education Services website: https://education.emc.com/guest/campaign/data_science.aspx"
5969,yes/no,B007YJYNRQ,Is this the same as the Tor program?,N,no this is really good
5970,yes/no,B007YJYNRQ,Does it work with a Mac Book Air?,Y,"Yes, I use it with my air."
5971,yes/no,B007YJYNRQ,Does it work on a chromebook?,Y,"I sort of doubt it. It would depend if you can install another browser, such as Mozilla (the SurfEasy product uses Mozilla as the browser and installs the SurfEasy VPN software as a browser add-in)."
5972,open-ended,B007YJYNRQ,How can I uninstall it?,,"STEP 1: Hold down the SurfEasy VPN app icon on the main screen and tap ""X"" STEP 2: Go to Settings&gt;General&gt;Profiles STEP 3: Select the SurfEasy Profiles and tap ""Remove"""

5974,yes/no,B007YJYNRQ,does it work on different computers,?,It will work on any computer. You will have to install on each one.
5975,yes/no,B007YJYNRQ,Is there any difference in functionality between the stick and the $3/month iPad app?,?,"Stick is one-time fee, not monthly. Also, it will only work on computers, not tablets."
5976,open-ended,B007YJYNRQ,How many GB of data can one use per month without either being shut down for that month or being required to pay extra? Does it use calendar month?,,"According to the SurfEasy website: You get 500MB/month for free on the Starter VPN plan, as well as plenty of opportunities to earn more data by referring friends. I do not know if this is by calendar month, or within a 30 day period of time. I will tell you, that if you load the App on your mobile device (smartphone/tablet), it will AUTOMATICALLY engage whenever you brouse the internet. You will blast through the 500GB VERY quickly. I had difficulty removing it from my phone and had to contact their technical support staff for assistance to remove it. If you use SurfEasy by plugging it into your computer, you can choose when you want to use it, and therefore extend your 500MB a bit longer."
5977,yes/no,B007YJYNRQ,Does SurfEasy slow down my badwidth?,?,I've been using it for about a year and I have not notice any slow downs on my work computer. I have not tried it on my home computer yet.
5978,yes/no,B007YJYNRQ,Does it work with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S?,?,You have to download the app as the the USB surfeasy only works on a pc....i have the app on my phone and tablet.... Works great...
5979,open-ended,B007YVON5Q,Is this a student edition or a full commercial license?,,The one I purchased was a full commercial license.
5980,open-ended,B007YVON5Q,"Why Adobe Master Collection CS6 costs LESS than Adobe Photoshop CS6 which costs $1,599?",,"Because it's a fake serial number, at least that's what happened to me. I called Adobe to find out why my serial number wasn't working and they told me it wasn't real. So be careful!"
5981,open-ended,B007YVON5Q,is this an upgrade package? or a stand alone install?,,My seller (who just seemed to have changed their name after scamming a bunch of people out of their money) sold me a fraudulent copy...So it's not an upgrade or a standalone but it was supposed to be a standalone.
5982,yes/no,B007YVON5Q,can i install this on 2 computers?,N,No
5983,yes/no,B007YVON5Q,"Hi, Can this serial number be registered on "" My Adobe Account page""? I have CS6 installed but need a serial number to activate.",Y,Yes. That's how I did it.
5984,open-ended,B007YVON5Q,"Is this a Adobe Volume Licensing (AVL)? If it is, is it Legal commercial use by other company?",,"Is this the same seller, I purchase this product a while back and ask the seller question. The seller stated it is fully license and I should have no problem. I was able to register the serial through adobe. I would contact the seller first."
5985,open-ended,B007YVON5Q,"If this is a computer download, why is there a shipping charge? And, is there any way to get the installation discs?",,"I have one copy of the DVD version. It is brand new and has never been used. If you don't want the download version, I am willing to sell you the boxed copy. Adobe no longer sells this version. I have sold these for almost twice the money the item is listed for now."
5986,open-ended,B007YVON5Q,"Waiting for my new computer, and I see that, theres no serial key when downloading this??How is this going to work, as its from Adobe?",,Contact the seller. He was very helpful when I had questions.
5987,open-ended,B007YVON5Q,is this a full retail version? is it legal licence? does it come with original box and serial is legal?can i register this product to adobe web?,,It is the full version. It does not come with a box or a serial #

5992,yes/no,B007ZQJQAC,Is Reuion compatable with Ancestry.com on line for updates etc.,?,No but it is over all a better program than Family tree Maker. I use Reunion and Ancestry.com together. You don't get ancestry updates or anything from ancestry with it. I know Reunion is expensive but in my opinion it is money well spent.
5993,open-ended,B007ZQJQAC,What are the system requirements?,,Reunion is the source for that information.
5994,open-ended,B007ZQJQAC,I need to transfer my ftm files from a windows pc to my new mac. carbonite saved info but not the FTM software. i'll buy reunion for mac then what?,,I would call or email reunion they respond quickly!
5995,yes/no,B007ZQJQAC,Does Reunion 10 work with Mac OS 10.9.1 (Mavericks)?,?,When you look at the content of this new upgrade - it does look substantial - the best thing to do is email Reunion and ask for confirmation. They are pretty good and answering questions and for your piece of mind it is better to get the information you need from 'the horses mouth'.
5996,yes/no,B007ZQJQAC,Can you transfer a ged.com from Family Tree Maker (Windows program) to the Reunion Program for Mac?,Y,"Yes, it is very easy. Just export your ged com file to disk then import it into Reunion."
5997,yes/no,B007ZQJQAC,I'm running mac 10.10.1 and I have old reunion 8 files on this mac. So... can I open old R-8 files in R-10 on my current mac?,?,"YES! Reunion 10 will convert older versions. The basic database format does not change, only the features and devices it works on. Go to the Leister.com web site for more details: http://www.leisterpro.com/doc/version10/upgrade.php Specific Instructions: http://www.leisterpro.com/doc/version10/questions/answers/howtoupgrade.php"

And if I got the iMac version later, would info synch from phone to computer?",,"Not sure, but it DOES work from iMac to iPhone. Reunion people are quite prompt at answering questions. Check http://www.LeisterPro.com"
5999,open-ended,B0080UPRSC,"Is this the actual software or just a DVD? and also, what software is included if it is actually the software?",,"This is the full version that comes on the original DVD. Serial activation key is also included in this package. This is the same software package found here: http://shop.adobe.com/store/adbestap/en_SG/pd/ThemeID.30575200/productID.257993700 The only difference is that the outer box is not included, just the inner box that contains the actual software."
6000,open-ended,B0080UPRSC,Can I still get a license for two Macs or is it one license for Mac and one for Win?,,My software package purchased had one license for MAC & one for WIN. With the valid serial you get with your purchase you could potentially load it on two MAC machines you own. Follow the directions carefully that came inside your software box.
6001,yes/no,B0080UPRSC,Will this function on any system (Mac or Win 7) and is it complete Adobe Web &amp; Design Premium?,Y,"Yup, it has a DVD (2 separate) for Windows and Mac OS."

6003,open-ended,B0081SN1K4,"""I already have a retail product designed to be sold via a Internet website store."" MY QUESTION: ""If I purchase the Growthink Product will it give me extensive information how to raise the money I need over the Internet by hundreds of people Donating?",,"The product really depends on you. The producer of the product does an excellent job marketing it. But, don't believe the hype. Your ability to raise money over the internet will be solely because of you and perhaps how you use this product."
6004,yes/no,B0081SN1K4,Will this product be useful in creating a business plan for a Home Health Care Agency?,N,No it will not in my opinion. If you are making and selling widgets it would be good . I would suggest going to sba.gov it has an interactive business plan you can fill out
6005,open-ended,B0081SN1K4,Will this business plan template cater to the film and media business? I heard it only caters to retail companies?,,Yes
6006,yes/no,B0081SN1K4,is this good for a opening a restaurant,?,Most Certainly!! It can be customized to suit your business venture.

Could this work for that type of business, or is it better for selling actual physical products?",,"I am not finished setting up my business plan with this product. But, from what i have started it can be used for any type of business plan, to include non-profit.... Roy"
6008,yes/no,B0081SN1K4,I am franchising an idea. Will this template help with that sort of model?,Y,"This is a basic business plan template (Microsoft Word) with suggestions for content written in it. I don't think it will sufficiently or specifically serve the purpose you need it for. Using a Microsoft online template will serve the same purpose as this template. However, if you have never done a business plan before it is a good guide for creating or developing your business plan. The same basic principals should apply to your franchise idea as it would for any other business. If I can be of further assistance feel free to contact me @ deshinab@gmail.com. Hope this helps."
6009,open-ended,B0081SN1K4,Does it contain all of the information promised in the advertisement? Is the package complete?,,"It does contain the information. Ive seen this advertised with other discs as part of a package, but, i just ordered the ONE cd.. It is VERY helpful if u need a TEMPLATE to follow. You simply just fill it out. You can also modify it to make it work specificaly to your business. Best money i spent so far for help on a template. Well worth the money.. It put me at ease becasue the hardest part about coming up with a business plan is knowing where, and how to start.. you shud by.. I hope this helps u!! -Spencer"

6018,open-ended,B0081TYO6I,I recently purchased this item and find it wonderful! I would like to know how to enter my merchant number maunualy so i can run credit cards.,,"In the POS software, the Merchant Service provider should be (connected or embedded with in the POS software itself once you have chosen which Merchant Service you use. This is done within the POS software and Merchant Services once it is set up). I too had this issue with the basic card swipe with this package. I installed an Ingenico IPP 350 PIN pad so that all is run thru the PIN pad ""NOTE""(be sure to find a PIN pad that works with your Merchant Services. In many cases you can not install a generic, it has to work with your Merchant Service provider). This also gives you the ability to accept debit cards so the customer can input their PIN Number. I hope that this makes sense, if not just contact your Merchant Service Provider and they can assist you in setting this up thru your POS Terminal."

6025,yes/no,B0082SMDZ2,Will this do a fresh install on a laptop that won't boot,?,"It sounds like a very difficult ?, Not being able to see it for my self. But nothing lost by trying. If it won't load you, more than likely have a lot bigger problems, like hardware issues. Sorry if this won't fix the problem. You may need a new laptop."

6028,open-ended,B00835PAUY,Is it real AUTODESK these products? The products are not counterfeit copy?,,"These are real, this is a normal thing for students. You can not profit off of this program, hence why it is for student. You can do everything you can with the expensive version, but your not supposed to sell your work. It is legit.

6031,yes/no,B0083F8Z6A,"If I buy sages Act pro software, would I be able to download on several computers ??",?,"Last I know of, buying 1 license allowed you to download onto 3 different computers.

It costs a little more, but seems to have eliminated some of the problems I was having with the 2011 version I had been using. If you're going to spend that much money, I would suggest going with the newest version by the company now owning it. The the Act! Pro v16 works great on Windows 8!"

6036,yes/no,B0083TP500,Which levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) are covered by this course?,?,I've heard that going though all 5 levels will land you around an A2. To get to a B1 or higher would more than likely require immersion and/or a lot of exposure to the language outside of any program.
6037,open-ended,B0083TP500,"Does the phone or mac version support multiple users? For example, if my wife and I want to use the software will it track our progress separately?",,"No. Single User, but you can install it on up to 3 machines."

If not, What other materials does the student need?",,"Yes, you will intrinsically learn the grammar from workouts and they also explain the grammar in detail in every lesson video - they do this slowly and repeat themselves many times."

6043,open-ended,B0083TP500,Does the course material have somewhere or refer to a guide for the grammmar involved in each workout?,,"You just repeat the lessons again and again if they are not sticking. No separate book. It is not a course, but a way to learn german"

6050,open-ended,B0084BPZO8,"How is this ran, off of AA rechargeable batteries and is a charger supplied?",,"The LeapPad2 does NOT come with a charger - unless you get the LeapPad2 Power.

At the top left corner of the document click on ""file"", you will get an option to ""save as"". place the pointer on ""save as"" then on the drop down button. You will now see an option to save the file as a Word document. Select it and watch it convert. That's it!"
6063,yes/no,B0084PK8CS,does it allow a pdf form to be fillable,Y,"Yes. Forms are fillable either through a typewriter tool or by converting the document/spreadsheet to the appropriate program. I personally think the typewriter tool is easiest to use and cleaner, but I also consider myself a little better than novice user. If you are more advanced, you may whichever way you choose to work well. Good luck!"
6064,open-ended,B0084PK8CS,why it prints small pages ?,,you can change the settings of how it prints in the print function. You can select 'fit to page' or 'none'.

6068,open-ended,B0084PK89G,can you scan paper to pdf? example scan paper from your pinter and after scan you can read it en pdf format? Thanks,,Converter takes a PDF and converts it to Excel and Word formats. There are other PDF programs that do what you want to do. Additionally this program is a waste of money. But it cost so little that it's not worth the effort to return.

6070,open-ended,B0084PK89G,"So, I can edit text in any PDF document?",,I found that it works on my PDF documents OK.
6071,open-ended,B0084PK89G,Can you use this program to combine PDFs or insert pages from one PDF doc into to another?,,No! This program is for converting a PDF to Excel spreadsheets or to Word documents. And it does a lousy job of it. I never bothered to return it because it just didn't cost very much. But I discourage anyone who asks about it. It is lousy. So lousy that they have never updated the program.

Ive had it since christmas and im still finding new features i wasnt aware of, but to answer your question, yea you can sample music for beats"
6097,yes/no,B0086QLF8Q,Can you sell your music if you use the sound clips included (and don't edit them)?,?,They are samples you purchased so there shouldnt be a problem with selling your CREATIONS. The new added pieces you put with the samples would be considered a new creation.
6098,yes/no,B0086QLF8Q,Does it utilize USB conectivity and Windows ASIO Driver,Y,"Yes, it can use ASIO, WAV or WAVRT. I use Mixcraft with a Lexicon Alpha USB Interface"
6099,open-ended,B0086QLF8Q,"Newby to this type of software--what additional equipment do I need to purchase to record instrumental? Mics, etc?",,"There are two main ways to connect your instruments to your PC to access the software; one is to buy an audio interface; this is a very basic setup in which you can plug a guitar or instrument into the interface which then sends the data via USB to your software; you also monitor output through the interface. The second way, this is how I do it, is to buy a small mixer which has what is referred to as a ""control room"" section; this allows you to hook instruments, mics etc to the mixer, feed them into the computer through the PC's line in jack, and monitor the output without creating a feedback loop; I like it best because you don't have to worry about that awful latency problem, the delay between playing and hearing what you played... with this setup you can hook up as many instruments as there are inputs on the mixer; if you play keyboards at all, consider buying a midi controller keyboard, these usually require only a single USB cable to send the signal in and power the keyboard itself, and Mixcraft6 recognized my old midi controller without my having to reinstall the drivers, which was excellent... hope this wasn't too wordy to understand; bottom line, I think buying a mixer is your best bet; you can use headphones or hook it up to a stereo system and listen through speakers."
6100,open-ended,B0086QLF8Q,"new to mixcraft 6 home studio recording...but when i speak or sing into my mic,my vocals are slurred and dragging...what do i need to adjust,pls help",,"Sometimes slow hard drive access times can cause stuttering in recording or playback. If increasing the buffer or latency settings in the sound device preferences (File Menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Sound Device) doesn't help, and you have Mixcraft 6 or higher, try this: 1) In Mixcraft, click on the File menu and select Preferences. 2) Choose the Recording preferences. 3) Try switching the Recording File Type setting from ""Uncompressed Wave File"" to ""Compressed Ogg Vorbis File."" 4) Now record something and see if the problem is gone. Good Luck!"
6101,open-ended,B0086QLF8Q,What would the Apple equivalent be?,,"I heard logic pro was pretty good, i was initially trying to purchase it; but they don't make it for my computer. Mixcraft was recommended by a friend of mine."
6102,yes/no,B0086QLF8Q,does it work with windows 8,Y,"It should. The box says it's compatible with Windows 7, Vista, and XP, but the website does say it's compatible with Windows 8. Hope you like it!"
6103,open-ended,B0086QLF8Q,"Do any of you use this with an external sound card? Is it necessary? My laptop has a worthless card, and it cannot be upgraded.",,You can. I have a four channel mixer that I run my guitar to ( it's an Lexicon Lambda) it works great when I'm recording piano or guitar. I use a pair of Audio Technica headphones to listen to my mix plugged into my Lexicon. When I don't use my Lexicon I just run straight through my speakers when I'm mixing virtual instruments.
6104,yes/no,B0086QLF8Q,Is it fun?,Y,"That's kind of a subjective question, but I think so. If it helps, my 9 year old daughter even uses the program to compose songs using the loop library. Check out the 14 day trial and see what you think."
6105,yes/no,B0086QLF8Q,All I need to do is copy and then fade songs to a CD. Dance recital stuff. Very basic...is this a good program for that simple level of recording.,?,"You can use Mixcraft for this purpose; you would need to first rip the CD tracks you want using a secondary application; Windows Media Player can rip individual tracks from a CD; create a folder in which to save them as WAV or MP3; then you can open a new project in Mixcraft... I find it easiest to open Windows Explorer, open the folder containing the files and drag each one into a track in the Mixcraft project where it becomes a CLIP... you can then move them around and order them as desired; eventually you will want to put all the clips in one track; if you drag a clip and overlap the clip in front of it, Mixcraft automatically creates a crossfade; drag the clip back and forth to determine how much crossfade you want... then you can use one of the Mixcraft CD burning engines to burn your mix to CD... hope this helps... remember, first you need to rip the selected tracks to your hard drive using Windows Media Player, to make them available to drag into your Mixcraft project..."
6106,open-ended,B00894F95K,Will this item ship with the CD or is this a download from the Internet?

Windows 7 handles 32-bit programs very well, so this software runs without any problems up to the capacities of my processors and memory. I have a couple of Windows 8 machines but have not tried loading this Turbo-cad on them, although I have read that it will run in normal mouse and keyboard/ desktop mode on Windows 8 without any significant problems. It will not work properly in arm/touchscreen mode however. There is more compatibility information and v19.2 updates available on the TurboCad/IMSIDesign website."
6142,yes/no,B008BM6ZXA,"Does the video training come with this amazon sold product, as advertised on the IMSI website",Y,"Yes but it is limited.

Thank you in advance.,,"You should not have any problem, as long as the renewal code on your NIS 2012 is valid. Do an auto renew, and the NIS on your computer should update.

6150,yes/no,B008DBTVY4,Will it work on a 64-Bit Computer ?,?,All 32 bit programs work on 64 bit operating systems since 64 bit operating systems are backwards compatible with 32 bit software.
6151,open-ended,B008DBTVY4,user reviews for Readiris 14 were 5 star. Prms installing? While it may be a prm to install-I didnt see it with my HP disc. Rate its usage?,,"I suppose it depends upon what you are using it for. The connection with a HP printer is through its own software not the HP disc at least in my case. My HP printer and software sometimes does the same thing in terms of scanning except in the case of Readris 14 the scan can be to MS Word which is editable and more importantly to me, used by my translating software to translate scanned foreign languages into English. My HP printers are on local networks and for some reason the software gets changed via HP upgrades. A short while ago Readris 14 stopped working right. A recent upgrade to it plus a recent upgrade to HP got it going again. A coincidence? Maybe even the Windows 7 upgrades have something to do with it. Hopes any of this helps."

6160,open-ended,B008EM0QYQ,does this work with windows 8 or is there a version for windows 8?,,"I have had great luck with it. More than satisfied. Between the return policy and the quality of the merchandise, you can't go wrong. Of course, you have to be prepared to do a little editing. It's not a miracle wand. Good luck"
6161,yes/no,B008EM0QYQ,is there a version for mac?,?,"I don't have a Mac, but here is the link to the Myscript website. www.myscript.com/volinks/en/webstore/myscript-for-livescribe/description They do claim to have a version for Mac, but I have no idea how well it works. I like the Windows version."

6163,open-ended,B008EM0QYQ,In my ignorance I thought this product could translate handwritten text from a scanned document. Not! Does anyone know of a program that does?,,"Hey Anne, when I write block letters, it does convert to text pretty well, but that makes writing kind of slow. If you want to use the Livescribe Echo and a software tool, I am not sure what is out there. On the other hand there are several handwriting to text conversion programs out there, some free: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/convert-your-handwritten-notes-to-text-by-using-windows-journal"
6164,yes/no,B008EM0QYQ,does this work with the live scribe 3?,?,It works with everything except the sky since that automatically uploads to evernote
6165,yes/no,B008EQUD4U,is it easy to learn,?,"Yes extremely to learn. In no time you will be creating movies that you will be able to save in a lot of different formats. Help online and even some movies on youtube.com will also be if assistance. This is the best program available to use to create tutorials/movies that highlight your desktop, etc."
6166,open-ended,B008EQUD4U,Is this just version 8 or 8.1?,,"The version is 8, but there was an update download to I believe 8.1."
6167,yes/no,B008EQUD4U,Can it do motion tracking?,Y,Yes
6168,open-ended,B008EQUD4U,Can you have one mac version (work) and one windows version (home)? does this count?,,"Here is what the site says about both versions ... ""with their own distinct platform personalities, Camtasia Studio and Camtasia for Mac do not share all the same features and functionality. While there is some overlap, each product offers unique features in order to solve problems specific to PC or Mac users. For this reason, Camtasia Studio and Camtasia for Mac are priced differently and require separate licenses. So, I would guess you have to purchase two versions."
6169,open-ended,B008EQUD4U,how many computers can it be installed on?,,"Actually, it can be installed on two computers for one user: one desktop and one laptop. This question was asked on the Camtasia Feedback site. ""Yes! You sure can install it on exactly two computers. That's in fact what our license agreement covers. We want to accommodate those who work at work...and work at home or on the road. :) Sincerely, Mike Curtis [Camtasia Employee]"" Per https://feedback.techsmith.com/techsmith/topics/can_i_put_camtasia_on_my_desktop_computer_and_my_laptop_without_having_to_purchase_it_twice"
6170,open-ended,B008EQUD4U,what are the benefits of Camtasia over Captivate?,,"A good review by Bill Albrecht: Captivate VS Camtasia: What's the difference? By Bill Albrecht on April 4, 2013 As an eLearning developer, I've come to know there are a number of development tools out there to serve our learning purposes. Like any job, a decision needs to be made as to which tool is best used to accomplish the task at hand. You wouldn't use a sledgehammer to fix a toaster (unless it was broken beyond repair, then I'd say have at it.) In the case of eLearning, you wouldn't want to use a tool that can't accomplish the task. Two of the most often used and requested eLearning development programs out there today are Adobe Captivate and Techsmith Camtasia. Both programs offer a wide variety of tools that assist in making web-based learning more interactive, intuitive, and overall fun. At the same time, there are some differences to take into consideration when deciding which one to use developing your curriculum. Let's examine both programs and compare. ADOBE CAPTIVATE Allows the user to create interactive simulations of software programs Takes detailed screen capture simulations Allows for complex student interaction; giving them the opportunity to go down the incorrect path and learn from mistakes Complex and varied activity and testing options (multiple choice, hot-spots, drag and drop, matching) TECHSMITH CAMTASIA Takes full-motion video simulations Great for streaming video content Easy to post to file sharing sites, such as YouTube Less expensive than Captivate BOTH PROGRAMS CAN: Capture screen and keyboard info exactly as done and typed Record video and audio/voice Include SCORM/AICC complaint quizzes As you can see from the comparison, Adobe Captivate is the better choice when going for something that is more interactive. A hands-on learner would definitely prefer a program that is made through Captivate as opposed to Camtasia. The learning and testing options are far more varied when it comes to Captivate. The program is a little more costly, but for the amount of services it offers it is fairly priced. Adobe Captivate can also be purchased as part of a bundle through the Adobe eLearning Suite. Techsmith Camtasia's strong points are in price and full-length video. At first glance, Camtasia looks a little like Windows Movie Maker and Adobe Premiere combined, so the interface isn't too difficult to figure out. If you are looking to capture a full-length video of an action you would take to complete a process on the computer or system, Camtasia is probably your better bet. It is also very handy for live streaming video."
6171,yes/no,B008EQUD4U,"I been having issues with the trial version. Have the bugs been fixed for the full program? It simply crashes and gives a ""not responding"" on Win 8.",?,"I have Windows 7. Camtasia Studio 8 is now up to version 8.4. Versions 8.3, 8.2, and 8.1 supposedly fixed problems in previous versions."
6172,open-ended,B008EQUD4U,What version is this? V8.4?,,The boxed version will most likely be version 8.0 or 8.1 but after you install the software and register it through their website the company will send you a link to download the latest update.
6173,open-ended,B008EQUD4U,My professor uses this application to put up lectures. My PC won't play them. I get a plugin error. I cannot find any information what plugin?,,"The quick answer I would offer is to install the VLC video player software. (search the internet for vlc or videolan.org) It is free and contains many plugins or codecs Windows needs to play different video file formats. However, your professor may be using proprietary software so step one should be to check with your professor and/or the school's IT department to see if there is any special software you need to install. If they are of no help then VLC is your best bet."
6174,open-ended,B008EQUD4U,compare with premiere pro cc ?,,"I have both Camtasia 8 and Adobe Premiere Pro. Camtasia is much easier to learn and quicker for a beginner to produce a pretty neat video! But that is because Premiere Pro is a much more powerful program, with a huge range of editing tools, especially if you use it in conjunction with After Effects. It can open any video file format I've ever tried to use with it. My major beef with Camtasia, is that it will not open AVCHD, MTS format video; which is the most common video format that most HD camcorders use. Some will save in mp4 (which Camtasia can open) but they are usually not in HD. My Sony Handycam would not save mp4 in full HD. And Camtasia would not open the Sony or my JVC video files without converting them first in another 3rd party program, which was a pain, and always resulted in a reduced quality video. The only acceptable solution that I have found for this problem, was to buy a Canon Vixia R40 which saves in full HD in mp4 format. I wish I had just invested the time to learn Premiere Pro right from the start, because then I would not be facing this dilemma about file format. Premiere Pro definitely has a bigger learning curve. There are tons of online instructional videos on how to use both programs. The Premiere videos on Lynda.com are really thorough but difficult to follow. I'm fairly tech-savy but I feel overwhelmed when I watch them. It usually scares me off, and I go back to Camtasia, which I am comfortable with. You might try Adobe Premiere (which is a more consumer version of Premiere Pro). You can get it in a bundle (approx $100) with Adobe Elements (A consumer version of Photoshop). I bought that about the same time as Camtasia, thinking Camtasia was just screen capture software. I liked it when I first started using it, a big improvement over Windows Movie Maker. But I didn't use it long, before Camtasia became my favorite for any video editing. (At that time, I was able to open my .mod files by just changing the extension to .avi but my upgrade to Cam8 removed that capability!) One good thing about Premiere & Premiere Elements is that the workspace and tools are similar to their full professional software; so when you do make the step up to CC, you will already be familiar with the workspace, icons, and tools in Adobe products. The other good thing is that both Adobe Premiere and Premiere Pro can open any type of video file format. Hope that was helpful, and not TMI!"

6189,yes/no,B008H3SW4I,Can i upgrade to Windows 8 even tho i`m missing Windows Vista Service Pack 2 because i`m having trouble intsalling Windows Vista Service Pack 2?,?,"I'm guessing your trying to install Vista so Win 8 will ""see"" it so it will activate. You can actually do a clean install (to freshly formatted drive or partition) without any operating system on the drive and it will activate. Mine did. If for some reason it won't activate on the first install , install it to a clean hard drive twice, just install it over itself not connected to internet. After the second install connect to internet and it will activate. There are several ways to do a clean install of an upgrade version, just do a search for "" How To Clean Install Windows 8 Pro Upgrade"" I'm wondering why Vista won't install and if you will have the same problem when installing Win 8?

6195,yes/no,B008H4PTVQ,"I have a Dell 64 bit windows 7, It will install up ot a pont and then it says, no assigned driver, it ask for driver to be installed .is that the boot",N,"There are two methods you can recover from here, you can restore to a previous point under the start up menu when you are starting you machine, or, if you made a recovery disk when you started your machine the fist time that is your best bet. The recovery disk will contain the missing file. If you do not have that contact Dell and see if they can ship a recovery disk, the last thing is to do as I did and buy one from Amazon. I have been able to restore several machines in this manner. I hope this helps."
6196,yes/no,B008H4PTVQ,I replaced a bad hd with a larger one. I restored a backup image to the disk but it won't boot &amp; recovery doesn't work. Will this disk repair the OS?,Y,Hi . It didn't help on my laptop !.

6198,yes/no,B008H4PTVQ,I have this on my screen: Windows failed to load because NLS data is missing or corrupt. My hard drive works fine. Will this boot disc cd work? -Bryan,N,No this disc if to save what you had on the computer only if you are trying to move what you have to another computer. You need your or an original disk for your computer. kevin.saunders99@live.com for questions.
6199,open-ended,B008H4PTVQ,Where is the 25 digit product key?,,"If your computer came with Windows installed, the product key will be on sticker on the computer's case."
6200,open-ended,B008H4PTVQ,Is this just the boot disk or does it come with the product key also?,,It's a Boot Disc & it did NOT work at all to be 100% honest with you. I was extremely upset over the whole deal!! I hope this helps? Take Care. Be Safe Be Happy Peace & LOVE HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!
6201,yes/no,B008H4PTVQ,bad boot sector. drive partitioned as C: and D: intend replace drive. Will these let me see and backup C:?,?,Don't know. Didn't work for me. Have you tried F11?
6202,open-ended,B008H4PTVQ,"I had to replace my hard drive and I dont have the orignal disk for my computer, is this what I need or just a repair. What do I need???",,Yes. Just make sure you have a 64 Bit computer. I had a 32 Bit and it sovled my problems. You will still need an OS disk to place on your new hard drive.
6203,open-ended,B008HO7306,How many computers can i activate Dramatica Story Expert on (I have a desktop and a laptop)? I know the screenwriting software can be on 3 computers.,,"Hi Bryan, You can put Story Expert on 2 computers, so you should be all set!"
6204,open-ended,B008HO7306,How much RAM and disc space do I need to run the program?,,The specs for this software are as follows: Macintosh only Intel-based processor OSX 10.5.8 or higher 1GB RAM 250 MB of Hard Disk Space Screen resolution: 1200 x 768 minimum CD-ROM drive Internet connection recommended for activation (optional)
6205,open-ended,B008HO7306,what is the proposed timeline for a PC version?,,"Story Expert is specifically for Mac computers that use Lion or Mountain Lion (and likely higher as new Mac Operating systems come out). All PC users (and older Mac Users) can purchase Dramatica Pro, which is the original program."
6206,open-ended,B008MIMHQ2,no questions,,"You cannot play movie directly from a dvd. But you can import dvd into the s/w and play from there. Remember, Imagination Studio is a video editing s/w and it does it very well. Hope it helps. Hope it helps."
6207,yes/no,B008MIMHQ2,"can you take out vocals so there is just the music,then burn that song to a disk and play it on a mp3 the songs are on my pc media player",Y,"If the music/instrumental part and the vocals are on two separate tracks then they could either delete the vocal track or mute it. But all the music I have seen has a right and left channel, for stereo, and the voice with the music are together in it. I don't know of any way to separate the two easily."
6208,open-ended,B008MIMHQ2,Can someone confirm that the Imagination Studio 4 product sold here does include Magic Bullet Quick Looks?,,"I bought it a while ago, and based on people who have contacted me since that time, I stand by my review that it DOES NOT contain the ""extras"" beyond the core program files I specified. That being said, it's still an awesome package for the price. But if you need those extras, you need to cough up more money and buy the full boxed version like I ended up doing."
6209,open-ended,B008MIMHQ2,"Can you take stills from a video clip? Also, Is there a photo editing / managing feature?",,"I still haven't figured out how to take stills but I just pause the video where I want to take a picture, switch it to full screen and then take a screen shot. photo editing... no. If your going to use this for video editing this is AWESOME! If your going to use this for photo editing this wont work for you at all. I recommend purchasing this for video/sound/music and purchasing adobe lightroom for photo editing. Hope this helped."
6210,open-ended,B008MIMHQ2,Dose it come with the NewBlueFX text plugin,,"It probably depends on the version. I bought mine on the Sony website, so I knew the NewBlueFX plug-in was included in that purchase. What I can tell you is that this Sony Suite works on different hard drive partitions and the NewBlueFX text plugin does not. It will check for the Sony Suite on the default c drive only, and if Sony's Imagination Suite isn't on there, NewBlueFX text plugin won't install. Also, the Sony's text is much more stable after updates. Also, if you register properly with Sony when you install this Suite, you can then log into your Sony account and click around until you find optional downloads which may include plugins, instruments, songs, and software."
6211,yes/no,B008MIMI8O,Are you able to use a green screen to change backgrounds on the video?,?,I downloaded the Sony Movie Studio 11 with the sole purpose of editing MP4 video files which I had converted from VOB files. When the Sony program didn't recognize them I didn't use the program again. I did not try using the green chromakey feature but it does have the feature. There is a YouTube video which shows how to use the feature in the program.
6212,open-ended,B008MIMI8O,Is this software like windows movie maker that is to say can i use pictures to make a short movie and can I have multiple pictures in one frame ?,,You would need a template to drop in several photos on this program. I have not seen such a template and you would likely have to either download one or do up a montage in Photoshop or some other editing software prior to dropping it in. The software just pans/ fades photos in those short movie setups. Hope that helps.
6213,open-ended,B008MIMI8O,Which build version is this (e. g. 11.0.0.322 or 11.0.295 or 11.0.75 etc.) ? Thank you,,According to mine it's 11.0.0.75
6214,yes/no,B008MIMI8O,"Received item, inserted disc and tried to install, but it only installs trial version of a different progam. Will return if problem not resolved.",?,"If you haven't entered the serial number in the program, it'll continue to run the demo/trial version."

6216,yes/no,B008MIMIY8,is there a patch to operate with windows version 8?,Y,"Yes. Sony released an update on Nov 1, 2012 to make this Win8 compatible - 32 or 64 bit. Go to the website sonycreativesoftware.com, and there is a horizontal menu at the top for downloads, or go to the page for Movie Studio Platinum 12 and look for a link for updates."
6217,open-ended,B008MIMIY8,"Which is better, buying the disc or the download?",,always get the disk
6218,open-ended,B008MIMIY8,MP3s? Can you record and save an MP3?,,"Although it is not specifically stated, you should go the ""IMPORT MEDIA"" button on the tool bar. This allows you to iport various media to the project window. You should, then, be able to insert it where you wish in the audio timeline."
6219,yes/no,B008MIMIY8,Will this produce non-flash slideshows for web sites?,?,"If you're referring to a 'movie' made from still images, it does so quite easily. If you want the same duration for each slide to show and the same type and length of transitions - it can do it all nearly instantaneously. If you want slides to be showing for different lengths of time, there's a bit more manual work involved. But in either case, you'd render out to a video format - for the web probably .mp4. However, if you're referring to a manual slide show on a website - where the viewer can move through the slides at their own pace, that's something entirely different and is done with a plugin (slider) and individual still images on the website itself, not done in a video editing program."
6220,open-ended,B008MIMIY8,What are options for sound editing?,,"Dear Valery: With this Sony Movie Studio Platinum Suite 12 software, you have many choices of audio editing, for example you can extract the audio from a video, you can change the volume of a song in MP3, you can make conversions of audio from one format to another, mix, trim, add, add silence between songs, add fade at the beginning and at the end of a song, you can add special effects, among other things but I'm commenting only a few options that I've used, but still have not used most of the options that the software has naturally required patience and time to take advantage of the program, as it also has an excellent tutorial that will indicating you step by step how to do, it is really very well recommend it since I've had other editors and this is the best and all off the foregoing their specialty is the edition of video clips."
6221,yes/no,B008MIMIY8,Does Sony Movie Studio Platinum Suite 12 accept ADHD inputs,?,ADHD is a mental disorder.
6222,yes/no,B008MIMIY8,Also... do you have to buy any other software FIRST to be able to plug this in for use ?? don't want to get it and find out later its a plug in,?,"It is not necessary to buy other programs before using this, in fact the Sony Movie Studio is the suitable program to begin if you have never used a similar program, because has excellent tutoriales"
6223,open-ended,B008MIMIY8,How fast will Sony Movie Studio Platinum Suite 12 render 30 minutes of MTS video on a i-7 machine with 32 GB RAM?,,"I really don't know, but I have an I-7, with only 8 gb ram; most of my grandchildren movies are about 30 minutes, and I walk away from the render for 30 minutes, come back, and it's done."
6224,open-ended,B008MIMIY8,Does this software have any sort of image stabilization or vibration reduction? i know vr is normally in the cameras.,,"Hi Austin, Yes It has image stabilization. It has Pan Smoothing, stabilization amount and rolling shutter correction. Hope this helps. Randell"
6225,yes/no,B008MIMIY8,can I edit a sermon with this?,?,"Assuming you mean a recording of one, yes. Movie Studio includes video and sound editing software."

6228,yes/no,B008MIMHDU,"Can you do live capture from a DV camcorder via FireWire? I know this is possible for Movie Studio 13, but not sure for version 12...",Y,Yes you can.
6229,open-ended,B008MIMHDU,I have used Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 7 for several years. Is the screen lay-out for Platinum 12 the same or close?,,"Haven't used version 7 so I can't speak the difference. But I would assume before version 13, there were no dramatic UI changes. Even the 13, lay-out is still the same. It's just the large icons found annoying in name of ""touch screen friendly""."
6230,yes/no,B008MIMHDU,"Will I be able to install this on more than one computer? I would be the only user, but I'm obviously I'll be getting new PCs now and then.",?,"Te software prompts you to register. I have it in tow computers and didn't have a problem. I would imagine if you want to do it in a large number of computers, the software company may question that but again, I am not sure. I hope this helps."
6231,yes/no,B008MIMHDU,2 questions: 1. Does this work on Windows XP and 2. Once you add a music bed can you go back and do a voice-over without erasing the music bed? Thanks,?,"i don't know if it runs on xp/2. i'm running 8 and it works fine. as far as the music goes. you can add different tracks, one of them can be music and another one can be voice over and you can edit each track individually."

6245,open-ended,B008MN6HE0,"I have a 5 year old Dell laptop, windows 7, that one day started freezing 6 seconds into booting up. The computer guys at work all seem to agree that it most likely had a bad hard drive. I replaced it with a new one and now when I boot it up I recieve...",,"I have an HP laptop. It was operating on Windows 7 Home. I ordered these discs when I started having issues with it. I wiped my hard drive and installed the operating system from these discs. Unfortunately, for me, these appear to be a generic operating system. It does work, but it lacks some of the programs and look and feel of a HP laptop. If you just want a barebones WIN 7 OS, these should work. If you are looking to get back to the way your Dell looked when you first got it, then I would contact Dell Customer Service for support on getting the original recovery CDs. The support, and the discs, are not free unless you are under warranty. But, I have had good luck with them on a Dell that I have."

The whole point of the recovery disk is to return your Windows operating system to you.

6270,open-ended,B008MR2GUA,Is this as good as Photoshop or is it basically like Piknik/PhotoMonkey.com?,,"Hi Kateyn, I have use the photo side of this software for 10+ years to do any number of editing. I would say it is not a 100% match to Photoshop feature for feature, but it is all that a sophisticated non-professional needs in a photo editor. You can do so much with it and the learning curve is not so steep. Has very useful tutuorials and plenty of online forums with great user interaction. It all comes down to price, features and your intended use. It is a wonderful application for the price. I like to have fun editing my photos and to this day, I have never felt a need to spend the extra money for Photoshop. I hope this helped. :-)"
6271,yes/no,B008MR2GUA,can it take peices of pre recorded video and cut and splice them any way a user chooses to play it?,Y,"Yes, provided the video files are compatible with the software. I use it to splice music videos for YouTube."
6272,yes/no,B008MR2GUA,"Can I join videos together from youtube, and re -upload them as one?",?,I would say if you can get the video off U tube onto your hard drive you can manipulate it any way you wish. But I think this program doesn't help you get video from unwilling sources.
6273,open-ended,B008MR2GUA,Can you photo shop out objects or people from pictures?,,Yes - there are a couple of ways to remove objects and people. It works much like Photoshop in that regard.
6274,open-ended,B008MR2GUA,I have a new (old) computer with W7 OS. I used to have W XP with Ulead XL as my photo handling software but it won't work on W7. What are my options?,,I would recommend you try the Corel Paintshop Pro X5 Suite. It's affordabe and easy to use. I' ve been using this for 2 years now and it helps me alot in my photo and video works. Good luck.
6275,open-ended,B008MR2GUA,"Is this both programs as a package, or did Corel cram it all into one program?",,It is two programs in one box. Two CDs.
6276,yes/no,B008MR2GUA,will it work with windows 8,?,Yes. I've had no problems.
6277,open-ended,B008MR2EGG,how does it compare with Photoshop CS6?,,"This is a very hard question to answer. I assume that you are asking about the comparison between CorelDraw in general and CS6, right? Not between the Student Suites and CS6? Basically, the design logic behind these two programs are very different, on purpose, of course. If you are used to one, it's hard to get used to the other one. It's just like Apple vs. Microsoft. Personally, I think I am more of an expert of Corel than of Adobe Photoshop. I know that Corel can do many easy tricks that are sometimes more complicated to achieve in Photoshop. I can do most of the things that Photoshop can do with Corel, but I am not expert enough to find something in Photoshop that I CAN'T do with Corel. There must be some, but I just don't know yet. Also, I think Corel is easier to use and you can create something similar with fewer and simpler steps in Corel, compared with Photoshop. But like I said earlier, this is a very personal perspective and experience-based. However, considering the prices between these two programs, if you are not a career graphic designer, and I would definitely recommend CorelDraw. On the contrary, if you think you will want to work in a graphic design company, Photoshop is the one to go. It also seems that Photoshop has a bigger support community which is either Adobe based, or supported by Adobe. If you'd like to know more about any specific areas, please do specify and let me know. Hope this helps."
6278,yes/no,B008MR2EGG,will it run with windows 8,?,"Hi Norman. Yes, I successfully installed it this week. No problems whatsoever."
6279,yes/no,B008MR2EGG,Can this version be installed on several computers? I want to purchase it for my university lab with multiple computers.,?,"We purchased this for use in our department, also in a university setting. I have it installed on three network-attached user systems and another stand-alone system dedicated to a laser engraver. (Essentially just a glorified printer driver in that setting.) No problems with installation or registration."
6280,yes/no,B008MR2EGG,I have a very old clipart disk from Corel Draw 4. Will this program open those clipart files?,Y,"Yes, it should open any old Corel files...I've been using Corel Draw since 1989...(v1.0!), and still have almost all of my disks, and sometimes dig then out to access old clip art. IF the OPEN COMMAND doesn't work, you may be able to get to it by using the IMPORT option. We are teaching my youngest the basics of Corel now."
6281,open-ended,B008MR2EGG,Does this version run on 64-bit Win 7 machines? Or only 32-bit?,,Yes. I'm running it on Win 7 64 bit with no problems.
6282,yes/no,B008MR2EGG,"Is this a full version, ready to use alone out of the box?",?,I had the Corel draw 3x version prior which when purchased years ago was the full version. I find this one to be comparable to that one and then it has some added features.
6283,yes/no,B008MR2EGG,Just bought for 53$. Will I be dissapointed?,N,"It's really hard to answer such a question, because it all depends on your level of skill and your expectation. Personally, I think it's awesome, and it can do more than what I want or need to do. I can only hope that you won't be disappointed."
6284,yes/no,B008MR2EGG,HELLO. Is Brazilian Portuguese suported?,N,"The Corel website lists Brazilian Portuguese as one of the options. If you did not choose to install this as a language during your initial setup you need to use your installation disk and choose ""Modify or Repair"". At this point you can install additional languages that you can then choose from to use. To use a different language you need to click on ""Tools"" at the top of the screen and then click on ""Options"". Next select ""Global"" which will display the installed languages for you to choose from. Hope this helps."
6285,yes/no,B008MR2EGG,Can this version of CorelDraw open Vector art CD's,?,Not sure what you mean Vector CD's but it can open adobe Illustrator Vector files use open with on the file and select CorelDraw program from the list
6286,open-ended,B008MR2EGG,Anyone have experience opening older (CorelDraw 5) .cdr drawings with this Home X6 version?,,I've opened very old .cdr files...very old meaning the old DOS versions of CorelDRAW with the newer version of their Home and Student Suite 2014 without any issue. For whatever reason the only place you can get this newer version here in the US is via their website. Here's the link that also includes a comparison sheet. http://www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?1=1&promo=5081&dcs_action=applyCoupon&url_coupon=5081&onyxcampaignid=5081&storeKey=us&pid=prod5140095#tab1
6287,yes/no,B008MR2GO6,Will this program allow you to scan from a 3 in one printer attached by a cord to a new Sony PC with Windows 8 installed?,?,"The program would not have that software. The 3 in one Printer would have to have the software that would allow you to scan the image. Once the image is scanned and loaded on the Sony PC, this program would let you modify it and touch up the image. You would need to speak to the 3 in One printer manufacturer about the software to scan the image and load it to the PC."
6288,yes/no,B008MR2GO6,Is the CD included with the 223 page manual.,N,"No manual comes with the CD. I think you can either download it or buy it. The program has ""how to use tools and features with built in tutorials, printable instructions (which I understand is a manual, but might not be), and getting started screens"""
6289,yes/no,B008MR2GO6,Can it add watermarks to photos?,Y,"Yes. Select edit, select image, select watermarking."
6290,yes/no,B008MR2GO6,Is this the full version of Paintshop Pro X5,Y,Yes. It's the full version.
6291,yes/no,B008MR2GO6,Does this program have capability to provide a slimming effect with people?,Y,"Yes, it has a Warp Brush with Expand and Contract functions and also has a Makeover Palette with a Thinify Tool."
6292,yes/no,B008MR2GO6,does it work with windows 8.1,?,"I've just completed the upgrade to 8.1 and the app started up with a problem though I've not thoroughly tested it. However, I only use the application to resize photos of properties for website advertising. So, it is possible that some aspects of the app won't work. But, as it did start up okay, I'd be reasonably confident in running it on 8.1."
6293,yes/no,B008MR2GO6,CAN YOU INSTALL THIS OVER X3?,?,"I believe they will be separate installs. I know I had 8, 9 and X installed on an older computer and they were all separate installs. You might be able to find an upgrade to X3 but I know the one I bought was the full program."
6294,yes/no,B008MR2GO6,Does this do well on 1. Old scanned slides 2. Old kodachrome slides turned red. 3. Batch processing?,N,I have no idea what you are referring to. I was really writing about X6 but there wasn't any page posted yet for the newest version. So I simply used X5 to make comments about X6. Sorry about that.
6295,open-ended,B008MR2GO6,can this program be installed without indexing? Can you only install on one computer?,,Sorry - I don't know the answer to these questions.
6296,open-ended,B008MR2GKA,"Can I erase backgrounds and replace them with other backgrounds, or place my subject in another background? Can I add subjects to a group of people?",,"Yes. Paintshop is a great complex...but a complex one. Suggest you buy a ""how-to"" book, this will answer this and many other questions you may have. Best way to get the most and the best out of the program. Unfortunately, the book is neessary to get any value out out of the program. My question is, why doesn't this come with the purchase of the program?!**"
6297,yes/no,B008MR2GKA,"can i import any .jpg.pdf.tif,png, etc and create a totally different look ( painting, etc ) with their filters, brushes, etc?",Y,"Yes, you can import and export files in all the common formats, and can edit the image in a variety of ways to change how it appears."
6298,yes/no,B008MR2GKA,Does this program allow creating a mask??,N,I am not sure and I will have to check.
6299,yes/no,B008MR2GKA,Can you make photo albums as with corel photo album 7,?,"I am not familiar with Corel Photo Album, but I can tell you that with PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate you CAN organize photos into albums and easily upload them to Facebook, Flicker, or Google+. There is also something called Share My Trip which provides for creation of a slideshow that maps your photos by location. The project is saved as an HTML file and may be easily shared. Hope that helps."
6300,open-ended,B008MR2GKA,"I'm pretty fluent in Jacs PSP7 (Rastor/Vector, many layers, cutting w/ &amp; w/out feathering. Big interface learning curve w/ X5?",,"Not familiar with Jacs PSP7. I picked up what I liked to work with pretty quickly after switching from Corel Paintshop Pro x2. Found a lot of neat interface changes as I got used to it. Very flexible program. Although I haven't worked with the areas you mentioned, I know they are supported in the program. I love all the special effects and play with them using my photos in designing for fabric. Hope this helps a little."
6301,yes/no,B008MR2GKA,Does this do animation (rotating pictures) like Jasc Paint Shop does?,Y,"Jasc was bought purchased by Corel in 2004. Yes it does rotate pictures. As for animation; I'm not sure if your looking for animated gif's or actually video animation. I would recommend that you download the 30 Day Trial of PaintShop Pro X5 from Corel http://www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4900069&cid=catalog20038&segid=8100006&storeKey=us and see if it is what you are looking for. If your looking at actual video creation there are quite a few programs on the market. I have used both: Windows Movie Maker (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker#t1=overview) and Pinnacle Studio (http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/Home+Video/Studio+Family/) Windows Movie Maker should already be on your computer if your running Windows Vista, 7, or 8. Pinnacle Studio I haven't purchased the newest version mine is a few years old and works great if your creating a large movie with hundreds of pictures. If your on a MAC then iLife/iMovie - http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/ (I haven't used it but hear that it works great) Hope that helps you out. If you have additional questions please feel free to comment back. MW"

6303,yes/no,B008MR2GKA,Has anyone had problems printing with an HP photosmart printer after post processing with Paintshop Pro x5?,?,"What kind of problem? Print quality, size, resolution??? Can you be more specific?"
6304,yes/no,B008MR2GKA,Can you download the corrected images to a disc?,Y,"If you save the image as you would images from other graphic programs I'm sure you could. I've never had a problem moving pictures from my hard drive over to CD or DVD, and I haven't seen anything about this program that would prevent doing the same thing. I just haven't actually had the program long enough to have had occasion to do that yet, but I have used many graphic programs that behave similar to this one and I've had no problem with it. I hope this is helpful."
6305,yes/no,B008MR2GKA,Is Paintshop Pro X5 compatible with Windows 8,Y,Yes it is
6306,open-ended,B008MR2IBC,What is the difference between Internet Security 2013 and Anti Virus 2013?,,"Internet Security 2013 offers more protection compare to antivirus 2013.Internet Security 2013 offers you advanced identity protection, two- way fire wall, Anti-Spam and Parental- Control. But of course the best of all is Kaspersky Pure 2.0 which offers even greater protection that the one's mentioned above if you do not mind to pay more."
6307,open-ended,B008MR2IBC,"Will this version work for Windows 8 computers? Also, do you have to uninstall anything first before installing Kaspersky? Thanks to all. I think Windows Defender must be disabled first.",,It says on the box that it is compatible with windows 8. The only thing you need to do to install is close all programs and run the install.

6310,open-ended,B008MR2IBC,It's now Feb 2014. Will this still be good to use? How long would this particular one be for?,,"Yes, you can use 2013 versions and will be good for a full 365 days even though you only install it in 2014. In fact, they will offer you to update the 2013 version to the latest 2014 version free of charge at some time in your 365 day period of use. They offered the 2014 version to me just last evening. I tried to update my 2013 version to the 2014 version last night and was not successful. Following their instructions to update was not quite clear, but I will try again. If you can get the latest 2014 version installed, it will be good for the remainder of days you have left to use."
6311,yes/no,B008MR2IBC,Does this work with Windows 8.1? Thank you in advance.,Y,"I have no experience with Win 8. I have Win 7, and it works great."
6312,open-ended,B008MR2IBC,What is the difference between the 2013 and 2014 version of Internet Security?? Would it matter if I bought the 2013 version?? Would it still work?,,"sorry, but I don't know the answer to your question."
6313,open-ended,B008MR2IBC,2,,Its wonderful security for a great price.
6314,yes/no,B008MR2IBC,Is it possible to get only the software license through the mail and download the software from the kaspersky.com site?,?,"I believe you can just download the software BUT if something happens to your machine and you need to reload it on a new machine before the year is out, I think you'll be required to buy another license. I prefer to actually have the disc so I have options at a later date."

6332,yes/no,B008MR32WQ,will it update my unknown driver for a newly installed mother board,?,PC Tune up will not update drivers.
6333,yes/no,B008MR32WQ,"If someone buys this TuneUp retail box, can you install the program without inserting the disc into a disc drive?",?,No. I didn't like the fact that you had to go to AVG website to finish installing. Either you purchased it or you didn't.
6334,open-ended,B008MR36FE,i am a writer and i need to know if i can dictate a book to this software.,,"Yes, you can dictate a book to Dragon! That is my reason for using it. When you first start, it goes through some exercises so that the software recognizes your style of conversation and any accent you have. That makes it very intuitive when you start talking and dictating. It does perform punctuation and grammar when you instruct it. So if you haven't done that before, you will need to get used to that. You will say things like ... Quote, comma, period, end quote. But another user mentioned that it doen't help with that, and I believe he or she means that if you don't know correct punctuation or grammar, it won't edit for you. Also, you can train it to know how to spell things like names that are different. On my iPad, I can't get it to ever spell my name right, but Dragon will learn and then do it correctly from that point on. You can even learn instructions for going back a few words and tell it to capitalize or delete or add something. It does take time to learn these things, but it is well worth the investment, especially if you don't type fast or need to stand. I think a person could also purchase a Bluetooth if they wanted to be doing something at the same time! But I haven't tried that yet. Best wishes to you as you write your book!"
6335,yes/no,B008MR36FE,Will this Dragon 12 work with windows 8?,Y,"Yes Dragon NaturallySpeaking v 12 will work with Windows 8, no previous versions of Dragon will work with Windows 8. http://www.nuance.com/ucmprod/groups/corporate/@web-enus/documents/collateral/nc_026405.pdf"
6336,open-ended,B008MR36FE,how many computers can you install dragon on?,,"The first answer is wrong. I actually believe that the Mac version will do that (being on line), but the Windows version as long as it is running, it only checks to see if there is an upgrade, and that's it. And if there is no internet connection, it runs anyway. You can install and activate the program five times. Although it is only licensed for one user."
6337,yes/no,B008MR36FE,does Dragon work with older mac pro,Y,"It won't Don, the Mac versions ""Dragon Dictate"" & ""MacSpeech"" are what you would need and they cost considerably more than the PC Dragon Home. $150.00 to $200.00 new. Maybe you may find a deal on a used version for Mac at Amazon. I bought mine used for about half the price of the new software simply because the box seal was broken. I sure am happy with my Dragon though. Once you get used to it you sure save a lot of time."
6338,open-ended,B008MR36FE,Windows2010,,Your question is unclear. Are you asking about MS Office 2010 or Windows Server 2010? It should work with Word 2010 but since I use Word 2007 I cannot verify that. If you're asking about the Windows Server 2010 the answer is no; Dragon 12 works with server 2008 but no indication it works with 2010 or 2013.
6339,open-ended,B008MR36FE,How can you install this software in laptops that do not have DVD drives (i.e. ultra books),,Have you tried copying the entire contents of the disc to a USB flash drive and installing to your computer from the flash drive?
6340,open-ended,B008MR36FE,windows 8 compatible,,Yes it is. Just make sure you have updated to the latest version of Naturally Speaking.
6341,yes/no,B008MR36FE,": My husband, A dutch immigrant has a slight accent. He wishes to transcribe in English. will this interfere?",?,"When you make your profile, the program lets you select your accent from a list. Also, the program constantly learns from and adapts to your particular way of speaking. It should definately be able to adapt to your husband's accent and it will get better and better the more he uses it."
6342,yes/no,B008MR36FE,Can two people use the same dragon program?,?,yes there are no restrictions on number of users
6343,yes/no,B008MR36FE,Does it work with windows 8.1?,?,"Nuance says (http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-pc/home-version/index.htm) ""We recommend 2 GB for 32-bit Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2008, 4 GB for 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2012.

I would assume that means all versions of windows including Windows 8.1"

6345,yes/no,B008MR347Y,Does this work on Windows 8? Does not list it on Amazon Platform info,Y,Yes but do not use the PC Tune Up. It sent windows 8 into a tailspin and I am not sure how I recovered it but I had to uninstall it immediately. AVG internet security works great. If you go on AVG site you can see other issues logged about the pc tuneup not working.
6346,yes/no,B008MR347Y,is it anti-malware also,N,I am not sure. I don't see that specifically listed.
6347,open-ended,B008MR37XK,"Will PC Mover Ultimate transfer from Windows 7, 32 bit computer to Windows 8.1 64 bit computer?

Also, this product WILL NOT transfer any Microsoft Office software. You will need the discs.

6348,open-ended,B008MR37XK,"The ad for the Laplink PCMover Ultimate indicates 1 Use. What does that mean? If I have to rerun the mover more than once, will it work?",,Yes it can be used more than once as long as it is used on the original 2 machines that it was installed on. If you wish to transfer to more than one PC you have to have additional liscense.
6349,open-ended,B008MR37XK,"any hardware needed (cables, etc)?",,"Hi Rodney. I've been using PC Mover for several years... It's a great product. The answer to your question is a little tricky. IF you can connect BOTH computers to the same network (e.g. in your home or office), either by wire OR by wireless (or even a combination), then PC Mover can do the entire transfer over the network. It's pretty easy. When you load the software, it'll ask how you want to do the transfer. Select ""Network"". Load the software on both computers (I think they want you to load the ""new"" computer first, but the instructions will talk you through that) and follow the rest of the instructions. If you can't get both of the computers on the same network, then you'll need a USB transfer cable OR you'll have to connect both ""hard drives"" to the same computer (I'm a technician, so that's easy for me to do... Most people wouldn't go that route). I hope that helps. If you need more assistance, feel free to write."
6350,yes/no,B008MR37XK,Can I transfer my Microsoft Office programs from my old computer to my new computer using the Laplink PC Mover? I hope so-I cannot find my MS Disks!,Y,"YES! I just transferred Office 2013 from one machine to a new machine and it works just fine. A few years ago, Office 2003 transferred perfectly as well - both programs and documents."
6351,yes/no,B008MR37XK,"Can I transfer Microsoft Office, Mozilla Firefox, Kaspersky 3.0, Internet Explorer and Adobe Photo Shop. Is the word program the same as software?",Y,"Ira, I transferred my photo software (Corel PaintShop) and Microsoft Office 2003 just fine when I used Laplink. What is more, all the associated data files transferred as well in the same submenu structure as I had them on the old computer."
6352,open-ended,B008MR37XK,"If you are just transferring data files, in what order should you: 1. Install the software (such as Office and Quicken), and 2. Transfer the data files.",,I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish here. I'm guessing that you are moving the complete old PC to a new PC. PCmover will move all of your software like Office and Quicken to your new PC. Your software will be fully functional in the destination PC. The new PC will be a carbon copy of the old one. I have done this several times and I'm still impressed how PCmover copies everything to a new PC. I hope this is the answer to your question. You can also call Laplink support to get more answers. They are very helpful when you call.
6353,yes/no,B008MR37XK,Does this program and cable work with an external hard drive and a desk top computer? Thanks. Bill,Y,"I don't think it would work... The product requires that software be installed on each machine. It's doubtful that the external hard drive would have the processor to run a program. I could be wrong, of course, but having used the product myself, my thought is that it won't work."
6354,yes/no,B008MR37XK,"Old computer died, only have the harddrive, does it include cable end to plug directly into harddrive and then move only selected items.",N,No

6356,yes/no,B008MR37XK,Want to reinstall Windows on my Windows 7 64-bit and then restore the programs and files. Can this do this using a external hard drive to help?,?,"IF I had to this, I would transfer the info from the external drive to the old computer and then use Laplink to move the data to the new computer. You can drag & drop files from the drive with explorer. However you cannot transfer programs. Good luck"

IF you can connect BOTH computers to the same network (e.g. in your home or office), either by wire OR by wireless (or even a combination), then PC Mover can do the entire transfer over the network. It's pretty easy. When you load the software, it'll ask how you want to do the transfer. Select ""Network"". Load the software on both computers (I think they want you to load the ""new"" computer first, but the instructions will talk you through that) and follow the rest of the instructions. If you can't get both of the computers on the same network, then you'll need a USB transfer cable OR you'll have to connect both ""hard drives"" to the same computer (I'm a technician, so that's easy for me to do... Most people wouldn't go that route). I hope that helps. If you need more assistance, feel free to write."
6360,yes/no,B008MR37XK,Can I transfer my Microsoft Office programs from my old computer to my new computer using the Laplink PC Mover? I hope so-I cannot find my MS Disks!,Y,"YES! I just transferred Office 2013 from one machine to a new machine and it works just fine. A few years ago, Office 2003 transferred perfectly as well - both programs and documents."
6361,yes/no,B008MR37XK,"Can I transfer Microsoft Office, Mozilla Firefox, Kaspersky 3.0, Internet Explorer and Adobe Photo Shop. Is the word program the same as software?",Y,"Ira, I transferred my photo software (Corel PaintShop) and Microsoft Office 2003 just fine when I used Laplink. What is more, all the associated data files transferred as well in the same submenu structure as I had them on the old computer."
6362,open-ended,B008MR37XK,"If you are just transferring data files, in what order should you: 1. Install the software (such as Office and Quicken), and 2. Transfer the data files.",,I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish here. I'm guessing that you are moving the complete old PC to a new PC. PCmover will move all of your software like Office and Quicken to your new PC. Your software will be fully functional in the destination PC. The new PC will be a carbon copy of the old one. I have done this several times and I'm still impressed how PCmover copies everything to a new PC. I hope this is the answer to your question. You can also call Laplink support to get more answers. They are very helpful when you call.
6363,yes/no,B008MR37XK,Does this program and cable work with an external hard drive and a desk top computer? Thanks. Bill,Y,"I don't think it would work... The product requires that software be installed on each machine. It's doubtful that the external hard drive would have the processor to run a program. I could be wrong, of course, but having used the product myself, my thought is that it won't work."
6364,yes/no,B008MR37XK,"Old computer died, only have the harddrive, does it include cable end to plug directly into harddrive and then move only selected items.",N,No
6365,yes/no,B008MR37XK,will work with win 8.1 os?,Y,Yes i just used this within the last month on an 8.1 operating system. Follow the instructions carefully!
6366,yes/no,B008MR37XK,Want to reinstall Windows on my Windows 7 64-bit and then restore the programs and files. Can this do this using a external hard drive to help?,?,"IF I had to this, I would transfer the info from the external drive to the old computer and then use Laplink to move the data to the new computer. You can drag & drop files from the drive with explorer. However you cannot transfer programs. Good luck"
6367,open-ended,B008MR29YI,how can I speed up copy time 123 dvd copy,,"Gerald, I own this product and have had no problems. Yes, it is slow on some projects. I'm sorry but I really can't answer your question as I am not that computer savvy."
6368,open-ended,B008MR29YI,How is it with copy guarded DVD's ?,,"I have has some success with it. It will ask you to download an add on. It is safe and it helps. I've had some newer DVD's that didn't work. Hope this helps. Otherwise, I highly recommend."

6371,yes/no,B008MR29YI,Will this compress doubler-layer DVDs to a single-layer DVD?,?,"yes, it can compress double layer DVDs to fit single layer 5gb DVDs, but the program can only do one task a time, and is very slow. Even it says it duplicates in 30 minutes, it is far from that. On average it takes about 3 hours to make one copy, and it does not offer to store in hard drive after copy is done."
6372,yes/no,B008MR29YI,Will this work with windows 8?,?,"I'm sorry, but I can't answer the question because the software was never able to show the ""destination"" drive. I contacted support and they weren't able to get it to work, either."
6373,yes/no,B008MR29YI,"Will this software copy""All DVD's""?",?,It has copied all that I have tried.

El programa ""sabe espaol"", de manera que ir escribiendo lo que escucha con la correcta ortografa del espaol. Finalmente, un detalle importante, el programa va a prendiendo ms a medida que es usado, pues incorpora aquellas palabras que no conoca a medida que tiene ""ms experiencia"" con la propia voz, estilo y vocabulario de cada usuario. En fin: nada que temer."

6377,open-ended,B008MR365O,"I understand that Dragon's Spanish version also comes standard in English, that if one wanted to change from one language is that the case?",,"With DNS Spanish version you can dictate in English. You just need to produce a separate profile for the English dictation. From what Nuance told me, the English versin does not work in Spanish. If you need just English, you can get it way cheaper that the Spanish version. But, if you need to dictate both in Spanish and English, like I need, then the Spanish version is the only one."
6378,open-ended,B008MR365O,i want to know if home Spanish 12 include the head-microphone,,Yes it is included
6379,yes/no,B008MR365O,Does this allow me to dictate both in English AND Spanish?,N,"hi Jorge. no, the Spanish 12 Home, it does NOT allow for English dictation. only Spanish. However the Spanish 12 Premium edition, DOES support both Spanish AND English dictation (user profiles). here on Amazon, i notice the seller named ""DragonMaster"" has the Spanish 12 Premium edition for a right good price, with very fast service and good ratings. Check it out."
6380,yes/no,B008MR365O,Does it work with Windows 8.1,Y,According to the product website it indicates that Dragon Naturally Speaking 12 is compatible with Windows 8 both 32 and 64 bit versions. I have only installed this program in Windows 7 64 bit.
6381,yes/no,B008MR365O,Can I use the English version of Dragon home to speak Spanish as well? I don't need the materials/box to be in Spanish.,?,"That has been my own question to Nuance for several years now. Their answer is a definitive NO, so far. The Spanish version can be used to dictate in English, but the English version does not accept Spanish speech; since it does not have the vocabulary, etc. (I wish Nuance would change their mind, since Nuance sends all of us nice offers for the English upgrades, while we have to pay full price for the Spanish upgrade)."
6382,open-ended,B008MR365O,"Informed that the Home 12 Spanish version is bilingual (Spanish-English) However, I can't find confirmation of this in description ofproduct.True?",,"Its not bilingual. I recommended the same version but blue box, called premiun."

After installing the 2013, just download the new version and save it. Then uninstall the old version, making sure that the box about saving the activation code is checked. Finally, install the new version you've downloaded. It should find the activation code automatically. I've done it many times over the years. It's never failed. Be SURE that you match the type of new product with the old for it to work!! For example, if your old version is Anti-virus, be sure you don't replace it with Internet Security if you intend to use the same license.

I would go directly to Bitdefender, or look on Amazon for the best deal from Bitdefender for the machines you want to cover with the Total Security Suite and get the CD so you have it. I am sure that you can go to the Bitdefender site and with a credit card and/or PayPal, or the Amazon equivalent of PayPal, you can download the product and the key with delivery of the CD in the mail. I assume this. One key applies to the package you are purchasing...that is, the same key for the three machines, etc. They have a new downloadable version for the Windows 8 and 8.1 environment that works very well, and when the 8.1 environment is released in October, they will be up to speed with that release as well. I think Bitdefender realizes that they have a great product and will do everything in their power to maintain their foothold in the Internet security market protection arena. I hope that this helps you."

Even if you want to upgrade to a later version (e.g. you have 2012 and want to install 2013), it is easier to upgrade by downloading from their website (to ensure you have the latest version) than install from the CD as long as your license is still valid (if expired, then enter the activation code first to renew/extend before upgrade).

Do I renew with Kaspersky 2013 or wait until 2014 is available?,,I recommend to you not to loose the protection of the product. If you want to wait is ok. but better be protected. Kaspersky 2013 is fine and sometimes you can update to the latestes version for free.
6441,open-ended,B008MR2IDK,how do i uninstall kaspersky internet security 2013,,Just Like most internet security programs the quickest way is to go to Google or Bing and search Kaspersky uninstall tool. The uninstall tool will remove it completely. With all security programs just search for uninstall tool and it will remove it. Make sure its from the official site of the product you uninstall. BE Careful not to go to a site you don't know just incase its a virus. So the Kaspersky site is were the removal tool is found. Just like Symantec is the place you go for the Norton removal tool.

6448,open-ended,B008MR38ZM,"Once I print out the documents and have them notarized, does that make them ""legal"", or do I need to file them with my county courthouse?",,"You need to get copies NOTARIZED by a Notary Public. You need to sign copies, too. I do not know what you have to do beyond that. Why don't you call your local courthouse?"
6449,open-ended,B008MR38ZM,is the information you put in only on your computer and kept private--I do not want the information going to any site or place other than my pc,,"Yes, all of the information you enter into the program resides and stays on your computer -- it is accessible only from your PC. Additionally, you have the option to password protect the program, so that you have to know the password to get to your documents. Hope that helps! -- Betsy Simmons Hannibal, Nolo editor of Quicken WillMaker Plus"
6450,yes/no,B008MR38ZM,"Will it read the .lgl files from Quicken Family Lawyer, V. 6.0b ?",?,"No, the files created by Quicken Family Lawyer are incompatible with Quicken WillMaker Plus. However, Quicken WillMaker Plus 2013 is compatible with all prior versions of Quicken WillMaker, as well as Quicken Lawyer Personal and Quicken Lawyer Wills (from 2002 and 2003). For more about compatibility, see the Quicken WillMaker FAQ at http://www.nolo.com/technical-support/quicken-willmaker.html#Version . Hope that helps! -- Betsy Simmons Hannibal, Nolo editor of Quicken WillMaker Plus"
6451,yes/no,B008MR38ZM,Would this software work on Apple Mini Mac?,N,No it doesn't. I bought it and had to return it.
6452,yes/no,B008MR38ZM,"If I do my will, could my daughter and her husband also make one for themselves using the same kit?",Y,Yes. It has a feature to allow you to start another set of documents under any other name. I have not found a limit so far and about 6 people in my family have used my software.
6453,open-ended,B008MR38ZM,how to import files from 2011 willmaker,,"Pamela, did you try Nolo tech support for help with this?"

Installed CD, clicked install, yes/OK to typical ""pop-ups"". Quicken WillMaker 2013 works as easily as earlier versions that I have used. Created Wills and other estate documents with ease. Absolutely satisfied with Quicken WillMaker 2013 and purchase/delivery via Amazon."
6456,yes/no,B008MR38ZM,does it provide a living will?,Y,Yes there is a section for living wills.
6457,open-ended,B008NP76AQ,What is the difference between the varios versions of Dragon?,,Paul I do not. I just know that For me the big difference is the ability to use the same profile (the recognition of a certain spoken word which becomes a written word) on multipile machines. Dragon learns as you go if you correct the mistakes it makes. You want to save this learning http://www.nuance.com/ucmprod/groups/dragon/@web-enus/documents/collateral/nc_025214.pdf
6458,yes/no,B008NP76AQ,Is Professional 12 available for Mac?,N,No - there is only one version for Mac which is called Dragon Dictate (version 3.)
6459,open-ended,B008NP76AQ,i need this professionally for text in german and english - is this in version 12 included??,,"There are separate Dragon products for German. There is a Dragon 12 German Premium product and a Dragon 12 German Professional product, each of which might be appropriate. Availability in the US is limited, some certified Dragon dealers such as ourselves would be able to obtain it (expect delays of several weeks) but you may be better off finding a European dealer. The German version includes English. Decide whether you need Premium or Professional based on feature comparisons available for the English editions as these differences are essentially the same in the German editions."
6460,yes/no,B008NP76AQ,does it do excel,N,Dragon works extraordinarily well with Excel. With text entry and with numerical entry Dragon NaturallySpeaking has surpassed 99% accuracy for my use. The one quibble I do have with it is that I've yet be able to successfully remap all the keys from the number pad to other hotkeys in order to not interfere with numerical data entry in Excel. The other small quibble is that auto complete in Microsoft Excel 2010 does not work smoothly with Dragon. This can lead to repetitive data entries which are similar but not quite identical which leads to the need to make manual corrections in your data sets in order for pivot tables and data comparison to work smoothly.
6461,yes/no,B008NP76AQ,"Does it work with Android 4.2 and above? Thanks, Steve G.",?,"This particular version of Dragon Naturally Speaking is designed to install on MS Windows. You can probably use your Android device to record an audio file to upload to your Windows based PC, like a dictation device."
6462,yes/no,B008NP76AQ,I'd like to evaluate this software. Is there a return policy if it doesn't meet my needs?,Y,I believe Nuance will give you 30 days. Let me show you my demo (I used Medical version though) that I created to show a friend http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pooky/10578881796/ It works quite well as long as you speak clearly.
6463,yes/no,B008NP76AQ,can this software work in conjunction with Autocad?,Y,"I have never tried that software. It works great in MS word, Excel, etc. Be careful in areas with a lot of background noise!"
6464,yes/no,B008NP76AQ,Is there a noise canceling mic that can be used in a high volume environment?,?,I use the Flexymike. It's great!
6465,yes/no,B008NP76AQ,does it work with windows 8.1?,Y,"Yes, it does. I am using it with Windows 8.1."
6466,yes/no,B008NP76AQ,Can this be used to transcribe from older (1987) audio tapes to text?. Obviously one cannot 'train' the software. Help please.,?,"Interesting question... If it is your voice that has been trained on Dragon and it's your voice on the old audio tapes, I would think yes! If not, you could try it; as my daughter picked up my headset once and her voice transcribed pretty well without being trained. You may want to call : 1-888-831-0088 ask for Mike"
6467,open-ended,B008NP76CE,Does Dragon recognize just one voice or can anyone in the household use it?,,"Anyone can use it but for optimal use, each user should create a user profile and allow Dragon to train using his or her voice."
6468,open-ended,B008NP76CE,What is difference between 12 Premium and 12 Student/Teacher Premium?,,Just the price :-)
6469,open-ended,B008NP76CE,As a student was wondering if my 5 year old MIC that did not work well with Windows 8 speech recognition (not sure if it was OS/Mic) work with this?,,"Probably not. However, when we ordered Dragon, a headset was included in the box, so you shouldn't need to worry about your existing headset."
6470,open-ended,B008NP76CE,what is the difference between 11.5 and 12?,,"Im presuming its minor bug fixes and/or patches...I updated it and I haven't noticed anything different but then, Im not a hard core user either. Maybe someone that uses it more would notice something ."
6471,open-ended,B008NP76CE,What's the difference between this and the regular edition that sells for 49.99?,,$49.99 is the Home version and doesn't provide some features compared to the Premium: 1.Application Support:Spreadsheets 2. Application Support:Presentations 3. Advanced Correction/Editing : Ability to playback your speech in documents 4. Ability to create multiple audio sources (more than one type of audio input device) sharing a vocabulary within the same profile 5. Ability to import/export custom word lists and user profiles 6. Easily create commands to insert frequently used text and/or graphics by voice You may look up the difference at the url: http://www.nuance.com/ucmprod/groups/dragon/@web-enus/documents/collateral/nc_025214.pdf Hope this is helpful.
6472,yes/no,B008NP76CE,"Will this recognize scientific terms? Chemistry, Biology, Physics, etc.",Y,"You can teach it the words that doesn't know, and next time it is spoken, it will know how to spell it correctly. If you go into medicine, Dragon medical works best. It is quite expensive but it does have 90 medical specialties built-in. Here's a demonstration of it. All versions of Dragon NaturallySpeaking use the same voice recognition engine, so the accuracy rate is basically the same, as long as the words are included in its vocabulary. http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pooky/10578881796/"
6473,open-ended,B008NP76CE,Will this program let me record lectures and then transcribe them? Or does the audio have to be in my voice?,,"If the microphone is close enough to the speaker, it doesn't matter whose voice it is. The speech recognition programs on newer versions of windows is at least as good as Dragon, in my opinion."
6474,yes/no,B008NP76CE,will this. program work on a lap top computer?,Y,"Yes, we have it on two laptops an older one and a new toshiba it works great with both. it takes a little time to train the software but it's great for school and documentation"
6475,yes/no,B008NP76CE,Does the Dragon 12 software work with WordPad (not Microsoft Word)?,?,I tried it and it works in WordPad.
6476,yes/no,B008NP76CE,Does this include the headset?,?,"Yes, although the quality of the headset is not outstanding."
6477,open-ended,B008NP76G0,what are the properties of this item?,,"It is a dictation software, you ""speak"" to it through a line or USB microphone and the software types your spoken words in a word processer software, most commonly MS Word. This particular version is for Spanish. I do translations from English into Spanish and I can tell you it is a very import part of my gear, it slashes by more than half the time it would otherwise take me to translate audio and/or books. Hope this helps!!!"
6478,open-ended,B008NP76G0,it have word on memory o it creates them as u speaks?,,"It has a base of words (quite extensive), but the ones that it doesn't recognize you can ""teach"" them to it."
6479,open-ended,B008NP76G0,"Is the Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 12 Spanish a bi-lingual program (Spanish and English capable)? If so, how efficient this program is?",,"Hello Carlos, This program is used by my wife for her interpretation business, so I do not use it personally. I can tell you that you can set up two profiles within it, one Spanish and one English, and use the program either way. Once you have trained the program to your voice and way of speaking, it is very accurate. About the only thing that will make the program lose accuracy is when there are other noises in the room. If you have a good microphone and a quiet environment, the program is almost perfect, and making corrections is easy too. Be sure that you have enough memory in RAM, and that you have enough hard disc space available too. These files can get pretty big, and if you are running low on either memory, the program will begin to do strange things. I upgraded my wife's computer so that she wouldn't have to worry about this for a while, and she hasn't had any issues with the program. I highly recommend it!"
6480,yes/no,B008NP76G0,"Hi, I'm in the market for 30 DNS Premium 12 Spanish. Can you fulfill my order? Thanks, Robert",Y,YES WE CAN please email us
6481,yes/no,B008NP76G0,Is this program compatible with a Philips DVT8000 Voice Tracer Meeting Recorder Voice Recorder?,?,I dont know about this specific device. However if you try to record from another device it won't work. In order for the software to work you most use your voice and a microphone.
6482,open-ended,B008NP76G0,"I have a telenovela. Could this program catch the dialog? Maybe 50%? The slower, less background noise parts?",,No
6483,yes/no,B008NP76G0,"Is anyone able to use both Spanish and English on the same computer, and switch between them easily?",Y,"Yes, you can. I have the spanish version, and you can create an user in English that works pretty well (dependimg pn ypu accent, of course)"
6484,open-ended,B008NP76G0,hi!!! what's on the box?,,"In the box you will find the CD needed to load the program onto your computer, the instructions, the license and a headset for audio and mic."
6485,yes/no,B008NP76G0,I have the unanswered question. Does it work with Windows 8? Someone post it before but there is not a valid answer to it.,?,"The following Nuance products are compatible and supported on Windows 8: *Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 *OmniPage Ultimate *OmniPage 18 *PDF Converter 8 *PDF Converter Professional/Enterprise 8 *PDF Create 8 *PaperPort Professional 14 *PaperPort 14.5, 14.2 *Note - PaperPort 14.5 is supported on Windows 8.1.

6486,yes/no,B008NP76G0,Can we install it in more than one computer?,Y,"hello Jose. the simple answer is, yes, Dragon 12 can be installed on 2 computers, for one user. i can explain to you more about that, or, if you have any other questions about Dragon, just let me know, and please check out my listing for this item. i have the very latest version ... 12.5 Premium. just look for me, i am The Dragonmaster , here on Amazon. thanks !!"
6487,open-ended,B008NP76H4,Premium version is also bluetooth compatible. What is the difference in bluetooth compatibility between this wireless version and the premium?,,"no clue. sorry. If you are in sales and hate to type reports, get it. It rocks."
6488,yes/no,B008NP76H4,Does the headset that comes with the software have convertible Over-the-head wearing capability?,N,No it does not
6489,open-ended,B008NP76H4,"If I use a non-wireless headset, I won't need wi-fi, correct?",,"The included headset uses Bluetooth. Otherwise, the software is the regular Premium v12. You can use it with any wired headset even if you bought the wireless edition. No WiFi needed."
6490,yes/no,B008NP76H4,Will this work with Windows 7 Professional?,Y,Yes it will.
6491,open-ended,B008NP76H4,I need a Dragon for my Mac Book Pro which one should I order,,Get Dragon Dictate 3.0
6492,open-ended,B008NP76H4,windows 8.1,,seems ok so far
6493,yes/no,B008NP76H4,Can I install Premium 12 on my desktop and my mobile computer?,Y,"Yes, you can. Enjoy!"
6494,yes/no,B008NP76H4,Do I get the Bluetooth earphone with the Dragon Wireless?,Y,"Yes if you buy that version. It's marked on the box, those with the Bluetooth and those without"
6495,yes/no,B008NP76H4,"Is the newest version, Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium 12 Bluetooth (Wireless), English",?,"The version that I have is English. I believe that there are other languages available, but the default language is english for Dragon 12."
6496,yes/no,B008NP76H4,Is this prodact usable on an I pad ?,N,"no, but the developer has other tools for other devices, which you can research here: http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/index.htm."
6497,yes/no,B008NP76FQ,Is this compatible with a Sony ICD-PX312 Digital Flash Recorder?,?,"As long as it records in MP3, or WAV formats, Dragon NaturallySpeaking will be able to process the file. You will have to train the program at the minimum of 4 min. first. It works quite well for me but I usually dictate ""live"" as I am doing now to answer this question."
6498,yes/no,B008NP76FQ,is this suitable for a 9 year old with learning difficulties,?,"I wouldn't feel qualified to answer that because I don't know your child. I'd recommend that you speak with you child's teacher who is familiar with your child's abilities and needs. If you are a home schooler, you could certainly order the software, teach yourself to use it (which is fun and useful anyway), then just try it with your child. If he has no speech or hearing impairment, I would predict that he would pick it up just fine if he's interested."
6499,yes/no,B008NP76FQ,Will Dragon transcribe my sermon mp3's into OpenOffice text documents?,?,"Yes and no. When using Dragon the speaker must speak in a way that will allow the Dragon software to accurately copy the dialogue. When preaching a sermon you do not say ""period"" ""comma"" ""next paragraph"" ""exclamation"" and such. Therefore, even though your words will be copied to text it may take you longer to edit your document then to just transcribe it. If you use Greek and Hebrew words they will probably not transcribe unless you teach your software these words first. Plus when you speak into Dragon it must be steady and clear. Usually preaching is not that way unless talk like Alexander Scourby reads. This of course is up to you. Of course you could just read the Bible aloud and your text would already be in print."
6500,open-ended,B008NP76FQ,I don't have a cd slot on my lap top howdo I install Dragon?,,Get an external drive.
6501,yes/no,B008NP76FQ,Is there a Windows 8 version available?,?,The newest version supports Windows 8.
6502,yes/no,B008NP76FQ,Can version 12 home edition be retrained for different single voices (somehow erase one voice and begin again with another)?,?,"The answer is ""Yes."" by going to ""manage user profiles"", you can choose a ""new profile ""and train the voice of the second person, and without deleting prior voice profiles. Thus, you can use the same software for different people by selecting the appropriate profile in the ""open user profile"" window."
6503,yes/no,B008NP76FQ,Can you install the software in two computers,Y,"Yes, up to three."
6504,yes/no,B008NP76FQ,"I have an older computer, will Dragon 12 work? I see in the reviews it can be clunky. Dell Dimnsion B110, 1GB RAM, Windows XP, Intel Celeron D. UPDATE: it works! I am writing this update with the software. It runs a bit slow but no slower than me...",Y,"I haven't used it on older operating systems, but my experience is all over the board with the other versions. I have had it work better on a netbook than a full powered desktop so its hard to say. 12 is better by far than other versions so I would give it a shot. I have noticed less conflicts when using other word processor programs (open office) than Microsoft Word."
6505,open-ended,B008NP76FQ,what is the best digital recorder to use with Dragon Naturally Speaking?,,I use a Sony and it seems to wor4k great for me
6506,yes/no,B008NP76FQ,Can I use this on my IPad 3 wireless ?,N,Sorry I can't tell you. I don't know. I don't have an iPad - I can say don't pay too much for this awful soft and you won't be too disappointed. It is virtually unusable for me. I speak reasonably coherently and intelligibly as far as I know...but this soft does not do what it says and has too many errors to be usable as a viable business aid. Perhaps in another 15 years they might get it right. I look on my perpetually hopeful purchases over the years as contributions to their research program as they seem to be the only ones out there trying to crack this very obvious nut.
6507,open-ended,B008NP76C4,"Quality of included digital voice recorder compared to 3rd party recorders such as those made by Olympus, Sony or Phillips? Comparable?",,It is very poor comparatively speaking. I have an Olympus dss for interviews I have to conduct as part of my job and its so much nicer than the Phillips they include. It's just my dss isn't that comparable with the dragon. I would recommend purchasing one outside of their package. It is a Phillips but just a cheap one and not worth it imo
6508,yes/no,B008NP76C4,will dragon work with windows 8,Y,Yes
6509,yes/no,B008NP76C4,"does this listing come with software, digital recorder and headset?",?,"Software, digital recorder and headset are all included. Set up and beginning use are easy. I recommend the product."
6510,yes/no,B008NP76C4,"I have Dragon Speak 12.0 I want to use a digital recorder with the Dragon Speak 12.0, is it compatible?",?,"I received a Phillips digital recorder boxed with my version of Dragon speak 12.0. I have yet to use it, however and do not know if other digital recorders would be compatible but I assume so."
6511,yes/no,B008NP76C4,will it pick up my teackers voice,N,"No. The software has to be ""trained"" for each person's voice who will use it."
6512,yes/no,B008NP76C4,does this have speech to text,Y,"Yes, in fact that is the entire purpose of the program."
6513,open-ended,B008NP76C4,Will this record meetings on the phone? I am looking into this product ot help me out with Meeting minutes. I'm not sure if it will recognize only my voice but will it dictate the meeting discussions?,,"It will only record your voice. I tried using it to record meetings and was unsuccessful. It's product information is clear about that, but I decided to try anyway."
6514,open-ended,B008NP76C4,how do you print what it writes,,"I believe if you transfer your writings to word, it will print. However I have been so disgusted with this program that I don't use it. Good luck my friend"
6515,yes/no,B008NP76C4,Does it come with the Phillips model 662 digital recorder?,N,"No, it does not"
6516,yes/no,B008NP76C4,can you use this on a tablet for a student that can;t seem to write out his papers in english,?,I suggest you use the Dragon that can be downloaded from the Apple App store. This one is for Windows.
6517,yes/no,B008P2Z8LG,"My Windows-Vista computer will not boot-up. Does this disk provide solutions for this problem? My email is ""cdicksonsr@aol.com."" Thanks",?,"While it did not fix the problem I was having while booting directly, it did allow me to get to the MS-DOS prompt where I could access the windows file directory. This allowed me to get the the windows\system32 directory to correct the problem myself. Therefore, I would recommend it if you don't have a copy of the original Windows Vista CD handy with you. Hope this helps..."
6518,yes/no,B008P2Z8LG,can this be used to switch a xp laptop to vista?,N,"No it cannot, this disc does not have the actual operating system on it, it only comes with recovery tools that vista would boot from. The disc allows you to bypass standard startup procedures. This is all what I have gathered from other sources seeing as the disc did nothing on my computer, meaning it did not load."
6519,yes/no,B008P2Z8LG,I'm getting a weird message saying that winload.exe can't be loaded because the application is missing or corrupt. Will this disc fix this?,?,It didn't fix mine.
6520,yes/no,B008P2Z8LG,I am receiving a bootmgr error when trying to recover with the recovery disk I made when I purchased this Laptop. Will this fix that problem also?,?,"Yes,it should do the trick"
6521,yes/no,B008P2Z8LG,My windows vista computer is not going past a black screen it has no virus. I was trying to reset it without a disc and went wrong. Will this reset it,?,"Whether it actually works is beyond me, the one I got was either a cheap copy or a defective disk and when I called the seller I got it from for help, he was very unhelpful and I called Dell for support and then Microsoft and MS told me that Vista was discontinued. You'd be better off just upgrading to 7 or 8"
6522,yes/no,B008P2Z8LG,"If i boot this disc, i want it to erase everything and start fresh, can it do that?",N,I have not tried that so don't really know for sure. I just re-formatted the hard drive before starting from scratch because there was a virus on the hard drive that wouldn't let me run the system.
6523,yes/no,B008RA5B8G,Can I just purchase 3 of these instead of purchasing the 3 user version?,?,Sure. You would just have three licenses. One for each computer instead of one license shared by all three.
6524,yes/no,B008RA5B8G,is QB premier 2013 compatible with QB POS 2013?,?,Oh yes.
6525,open-ended,B008RA5B8G,is this an upgrade or the whole program?,,This is the whole program that we used to upgrade 2010.
6526,yes/no,B008RA5B8G,Is there a 60 day money-back guarantee from the manufacturer with this product?,Y,"Yes, a 60-day satisfaction guarantee is offered by the product's publisher, Intuit. If you purchased from Amazon and got the box, generate the RMA under My Orders and send it back. If it was a download, first uninstall QuickBooks from your computer and then forward the confirmation e-mail you received for your order to ereturns@intuit.com, and indicate that you'd like a refund. Intuit will only honor your refund if you contact them within 60 days of purchase."
6527,open-ended,B008RA5B8G,How do I get an automatic markup onto the invoice for parts? I do not want the markup to be separate. I want a one line amount.,,"You would just then make it the price with mark up, if that's what you are wanting. Or maybe I don 't understand what exactly you are wanting to show."
6528,open-ended,B008RA5B8G,is this a disk (not used with the internet) or a web based program (internet required to use)?,,"This program comes on a disk and so you don't have to have the internet to load it onto your computer. It will work just like it is. However be forewarned, many of the great features on this program such as email integration,credit card acceptance,and online banking, do require the internet to work. Also software updates,tax updates, are usually done over the internet."
6529,open-ended,B008RA5DNO,I would like to get billable telephone calls both dialed -- and then charged as a line item on the invoices. Any luck with Add-On CRM's to do this? Thanks. John,,Sorry John I'm unfamiliar with this. Try Calling Toll Free 1-866-763-1760 QuickBooks Support. Good luck.
6530,yes/no,B008RA5DNO,Does this product the quickbook premier profesional 2013 have a user license for 3 included with it.,?,The version we purchased were off the shelf single user license. I understand that there are multi-user versions available.
6531,open-ended,B008RA5DNO,how many machines,,"Look under the Product Description on this page. There's a chart that helps you figure out which product is right for you. The chart lists ""Allows more than one user at a time"" with two answers: QB 2013 offers ""Up to 3, each sold separately,"" and QB 2013 Professional offers ""Up to 5, each sold separately."" I haven't see the ""each sold separately"" language in the past. The footnote verifies that ""One user included; option to add up to two additional licenses for Pro and four for Premier-sold separately."""
6532,yes/no,B008RA5CNK,Does Quickbook Premier 3-User 2013 Editions includes Non-Profit Edition,Y,Yes you can set it up for what you need best wish
6533,yes/no,B008RA5CNK,Does this version allow 3 users to be using Quickbooks AT THE SAME TIME?,Y,"Yes. We have the program set up on our server and 3 other computers. 3 of us can all work on QB at the same time. The server is what prevents ""crashes"" when 2 users try to access the same thing at the same time. It has never happened that we know of - the server is smart enough to prevent problems. Great program."
6534,open-ended,B008RA5CNK,Is for the disc that is shipped or is this a download?,,I got the Disc when I bought this.
6535,yes/no,B008RA5AVE,Can anyone recommend an alternative to QuickBooks?,?,"We're looking for one as well. Intuit has gotten so arrogant and so ridiculously expensive for small companies that they've left a hole in the market big enough to drive a startup company through. Sooner or later, they'll have a solid competitor and when that day comes, we'll be among the hundreds of thousands (or millions) bolting out of the Intuit gulag."
6536,yes/no,B008RA5AVE,Is the first year of the required subscription included with this software?,N,I have looked everywhere to confirm this as well. No luck yet
6537,yes/no,B008RA5AVE,is 2013 qb enhanced payroll 2013 for unlimited employees?,?,"Hi Susana, I'm almost certain that the box version is for 3 employees. When you install it should give you the option of paying a fee to get the unlimited employee function. That's what we did. Please note that I am not an Intuit employee or anything, I've just used the software since 1996 so this response is just my personal experience. David"
6538,open-ended,B008RA5AVE,how much more is it if I add the unlimited employee option?,,"You will end up with $429 (plus state tax) as it was offered in QB Payroll subscription renewal. I thought I could save if I buy from Amazon, but then there is option if you need to add employees, you have to call Intuit and it would be the same total."
6539,open-ended,B008RA5AVE,"I use QB Pro 2011, with Enhanced Payroll (up to 3 empl). I've hired again, what are my options? I don't want to pay the over $400 for renewal. Frustrating.",,"One must upgrade to the unlimited employees package; there's only two options with QBs - up to three employees, or unlimited (and the latter is only available with the online edition, period!). It's about a $100 more if I recall correctly, which quite honestly, is difficult to do with all the disturbing and extremely costly add-ons, fees, upgrades, additions, support, services, etc., which QBs perpetually assesses for the seemingly minor details and pompous efforts they provide to assist their patrons with their product. Apparently, this process is quite intentionally designed to limit service, comprehensive accessibility and ease of use to the consumer, while incurring greater costs as he/she becomes aware of the ""bait and hook."" And rather exorbitantly at that. Tread with caution. You will likely pay in excess of $600/yr to utilize this program effectively. Everything with QBs, which I believe ought to be simply included with the program, comes at an additional, and very unwelcome fee. Trust me. Look into the other free, online programs which provide a very similar service, without all the hype, unnecessary control and expensive fees for your small business. Essentially, QBs has got me very tightly wrapped around their little greedy fingers. The software itself is alright, but they design (and are constantly redesigning) it to be much more complicated than warranted in an obvious attempt to offer you support at a significant drain to your small business resources. If you're loaded, go for it. If not, I highly recommend you look elsewhere."
6540,yes/no,B008RA5AVE,Will this work with QB 2014?,?,I'm not familiar with QB 2014 but it should be compatible.
6541,open-ended,B008RA5AVE,activation?,,The activation instructions come with the product.
6542,yes/no,B008RA5AVE,Amazon price today is 164.99 for up to 3 employees. Will price go up to $429 for 4+ version?,?,There is $100.00 + tax charge for unlimited employees.
6543,yes/no,B008RA5AVE,do i need to sign on for a monthly fee when the payroll is basically the same every month? Also if its done in house why should I,N,"No, if you are doing your own payroll and printing your own checks."
6544,yes/no,B008RA5AVE,Is this available as a software download,?,"The Enhanced Payroll is really just a subscription to the service, there are many downloads during the year to update tax tables, forms and calculations."
6545,open-ended,B008RA5FIC,How can the quickbooks contractor version help me. i'm a home improvement contractor,,"The most important advantage of the contractor edition is that it supports the concept of estimates and invoices. You can create an estimate to give to a client, then update the estimate, and QB will track the line-items added. Then eventually when the job is done, you can make an invoice from the estimate. Not just useful for contractors, but also useful for auto repair or any business that is required to produce estimates before an invoice."
6546,open-ended,B008RA5FIC,is this a 1 or 2 user?,,1 user
6547,open-ended,B008RA5FIC,"I'm getting a gray screen during processing something. It shows the Open Windows listed, but they don't come up when I click on them. Any ideas what is causing or how to prevent this?",,"QB is a memory hog as are several other MS Windows programs. If you have Word & or Adobe open, close them and try again."
6548,yes/no,B008RA5FIC,does this product come with installation support,?,"Limited, if any, support is available from Intuit. Your best move is to contact a QB advisor. I am one if you would like help. www.pacaccgroup.com"
6549,yes/no,B008RA5FIC,"has anyone used the ""Bid"" portion of the program?",N,no
6550,yes/no,B008RA5FIC,Does the contractor version accommodate enhanced payroll service? Thanks,Y,Yes. As far as I know. ALL versions of QuickBooks do.
6551,open-ended,B008RA5FIC,i have a truck repair shop can i use this contractor version i am curently using quick book pro 2012 software,,"You could use it. I'm not sure you would gain from the additional features. Whether you would benefit from moving up would depend on why you are looking at changing, what additional functions you are trying to access."
6552,open-ended,B008RA5FIC,How many customers can I have with this version I have 2 currently. No answer. Thanks.,,"You can have about 10,000 customers in the standalone (e.g. Pro, Premier) versions."
6553,open-ended,B008RA5G9U,What is the advantage of Quicken deluxe version over Quicken starter version,,The Quicken Starter version can't read old Quicken data files. Quicken Starter version was created as a cheap and simple version of Quicken to bring new customers into the market. I had to upgrade to Quicken Deluxe to maintain access to my old Quicken 2010 edition data files.
6554,yes/no,B008RA5G9U,I wish to use this product to track and print checking accounts. Is this posible including printing each account?,?,"Yes, You can print checks. Not sure what you mean by ""track."" The checks that can be printed are a special purchase item."

6557,yes/no,B008RA5G9U,Is Quicken 2013 compatible with Windows 8?,Y,will quicken 2013 work with windows 8?
6558,open-ended,B008RA5EMO,"New to QB, for a bookkeeping business, can either QB Acctnt or QB Pro be used? Is there much advantage for the cost difference?",,"In my opinion, you should absolutely use QB Accountant for a bookkeeping business. QB Accountant gives you access to all of the Premier versions which include templates and reports for several kinds of industries. If you are doing bookkeeping for more than one type of business, Accountant is the way to go. In addition, the batch processing and the journal entry process make it much easier for those who know accounting to use the program. I believe it is worth the price difference, however, I watched for sales on the price of accountant and was able to find it for a good discount within a month of when I wanted to purchase."
6559,open-ended,B008RA5EMO,I just purchased this thinking it would allow me to set up a nonprofit account. How do I generate a statement of financial position?,,"Financial Position=Balance Sheet. Non-Profit does not use GAAP. Balance Sheet/ financial position is GAAP. You need to use Fund Accounting for non-profit if you want your books are set up correctly. I would look for a correspondence class for CPA CPE on non-profit accounting so you can see the differences. Fund Accounting is not difficult but it IS NOT GAAP and you cannot use standard B/S, Income Statement, Stmt of Changes in Financial Position, Retained Earnings, etc. to account for non-profit organizations."
6560,yes/no,B008RA5EMO,Can I still Buy the 2013 version,N,"I bought mine on ebay, for a reduced price. It was new, but for me still a waste of money. I have not been able to use it, as the bottom of the UI screen ends up below my physical screen, and there is no scroll bar to remedy this, at least not in my version, I have Quickbooks Accountant 2013. I tried for a long time to fix this, and though it was I who was doing something wrong, until I finally found several reports on Google regarding the same issue! No scroll bars, so I cannot scroll down to the bottom of the screen, where there are buttons that I need to use. So for me at least, this is a white elephant. You may want to research this before buying, or buy a different version. I would check a different version too first, to make sure this bug/issue is not there as well."
6561,open-ended,B008RA5EMO,"New to QB, I don't need it quite yet, so should I wait and buy 2014 or stick with 2013? How long does support last? Thanks.",,"QB Accountant is usually more than most people need, unless you have several companies that you are working with. QuickBooks Pro is usually all people need if your company is small and you aren't a bookkeeper or accountant with several clients/companies that you are doing the bookkeeping for. Support lasts forever, but right from the get-go it's virtually no support unless you have a couple hours to try to get a hold of someone that can help you. Usually google searching for the answer is quicker and more helpful, which speaks poorly of QB support. I wouldn't purchase it until you need it, though, unless you have a reason to do so."
6562,open-ended,B008RA5EMO,What is the name of the QB for Accountants 2013 for Vista package which comes on cds and if my system crashes how many times can it be reloaded without charges?,,I'm not aware of a separate QB Accountants 2013 version for Vista. Just Windows or Mac. I'm not aware of a limit on how many times you can reload as long as its for yourself as a user. Its not supposed to be reloaded for other users though without a license. We received a call once about why a copy was registered multiple times and once we explained why everything was fine after that.
6563,yes/no,B008RA5EMO,Does QuickBooks Accountant include Enhanced payroll?,Y,"Yes, it has enhanced payroll, but remember you must have your payroll subscription up todate."
6564,open-ended,B008RA5EMO,I am looking into purchasing the 2013 accountants version of quickbooks. Does anyone know if it is compatible with the 2011 non-profit version???,,"I believe you have to have the same version, that is the same year. Quickbooks is not backwards compatible so if your using 2013 accountant's version, you'll have to convert\upgrade the non-profit to 2013."
6565,open-ended,B008RA5EHY,If I purchase will I receive an official new genuine product in the box at this price or will it be some other version/replica of the original?,,Mine came as an official product. I have bought quick books at Office Depot. They were packaged the same.
6566,yes/no,B008RA5EHY,does this come with a money back guarantee,Y,This is a pitifully poor program. Intuit should recall it and give credit to anyone who has purchased it. You are better off with Microsoft Excell.
6567,yes/no,B008RA5EHY,Can you write checks from QuickBooks 13 for Macs,Y,"Yes, you can print checks from QuickBooks for Mac."
6568,yes/no,B008RA5EHY,will quickbooks 2013 work with my Mac IOS X Version 10.6.8?,?,"I do not know. It works with OS X 10.9.4, and I'm pretty sure it worked when I had 10.8 on there, but I can't remember much before that, OS-version-wise."
6569,yes/no,B008RA5EHY,Will it work with G5 Microprocessor,?,"I do not own a G5, but a little research on the web shows that it seems to be supported. You might want to get the 2014 version now, though."
6570,open-ended,B008RA5EHY,"Can multiple users use the Mac 2013 version? In other words, can we put Quickbooks on our server and have several people use the same company files?",,"You can, but you have to purchase either the server version or a multi-user license. QB allows you to install on one desktop and one portable device, but you cannot use both at once. Keep in mind that this can change at Quickbooks whim so this answer may be out of date by the time you read it."
6571,open-ended,B008RA5EHY,Does Quick books for mac have a pro and non-pro version? Why are there multiple sellers on amazon selling QB for mac and Quick books pro for mac 2013?,,"The pro version is for windows only the Mac version is non pro, download a 30 day free trial at intuit before you buy."
6572,yes/no,B008RA5EHY,My files are in Quickbooks for Mac 2007. Can I upgrade them?,?,"The Intuit website for QuickBooks doesn't list any limitations. It says you can upgrade your files from any previous version. Just to be certain, if I were you I'd contact them directly at (877) 683-3280 to ask them your specific question. Also, if you go to http://quickbooks.intuit.com/mac/whats-new/ a chat window will pop up within a minute or so and you can begin a chat session with a sales support specialist if you prefer doing it that way. Good luck!"

6574,yes/no,B008RA5FEG,can you print tax forms?,Y,"yes, even tho I have my bookkeeper do all that."
6575,open-ended,B008RA5FEG,how many employees can I handle with this program?,,"3. If you have more than that you must upgrade to unlimited at a cost THEY determine. For me, my 6 employees cost an additional $150."
6576,open-ended,B008RA5A00,Who will be first to check out budgeting? Who of you will be willing to plunk down your hard earned cash to see if they restored the 2011 budgeting design in this latest offering?,,"The 2013 budget module obviously has many problems, and my brand new download is already in revision 6. Let me outline some of the frustrating glitches. First, although 2013 Quicken Deluxe eliminated that frustrating ""rolling"" year feature (allowing you to actually create a January-December 2013 budget), the new module doesn't actually ""duplicate"" an existing budget. So when I attempted to duplicate my 2012 budget to create a 2013 budget, what I got didn't capture, for example, carefully planned month-to-month expenditures - like utility payments that are higher in winter than summer, boat work that occurs only in October (winterizing) and May (de-winterizing), etc. Many categories were simply zero. Or they were different than the prior budget. You can't put in an annual amount and have the program average that. Instead you have to manually calculate the average and tell the program to use that average for January and then to do the same for all the remaining months of the year. There are also glitches with categories and sub-categories, and that seems to flow through to reports, which sometimes drop categories which you've selected and sometimes add the category's total to the total of the sub-categories so that the total is wildly inflated. And often when you attempt to correct that, the budget drops back to using the existing year (2012) instead of the year you have specified (2013). Also, none of my existing reports for 2012 or earlier years came up correctly. They all came up with all categories (about 300) selected instead of ones I had selected for that report (about 50). I have used Quicken for many years and haven't liked how they changed the budget module a couple years back. But this one is really bad, and I'm wondering what to do if these major problems aren't corrected. I'm hoping that my many years of budgeting data hasn't been corrupted. And I'm wondering if Intuit has any plans to really correct this product or if some decision has been made to abandon it. I notice that mobile and cloud are big issues (apparently they're also having problems), and perhaps the big picture is that companies like Intuit or Microsoft are quietly exiting the PC field for products like Quicken or Outlook that reside on the PC. Maybe I need to be looking for a web based product like Intuit's Mint.com, and perhaps that's where they will really be putting their resources. Obviously, Intuit hasn't yet put their first team on Quicken Deluxe 2013."
6577,yes/no,B008RA5A00,Will Q2013 accept Back up files from Q2000? (my old computer with Q200 0n it has just died on me&gt;),Y,"Yes, it will convert. Can't go back once they are converted. I would make a copy of the backup (before you convert) just in case something goes wrong. Load 2013 and import the backup into operation, then back up the 2013 file."
6578,yes/no,B008RA5A00,Will Quicken 2013 import my Quicken 2000 Deluxe database?,?,"I highly doubt it, normally any intuit product will import from 3 - 5 years back but that is it. I always try to get a new version every 3 years or so because of this."
6579,yes/no,B008RA5A00,Can i use files from quicken 2007,Y,"Yes, they should work."
6580,open-ended,B008RA5A00,how many devices can I use this on?,,"Check your ""Quicken 2013 End User Software License Agreement"" for the product you purchased. This can be found by searching within the Quicken Help."
6581,yes/no,B008RA5A00,Will Quicken Deluxe 2013 import my Quicken Basic 2007 database?,?,Yes. Perform your upgrade then.follow instructions to.open existing file...there should be no problem opening your 2007 file
6582,yes/no,B008RA5A00,Does this version of Quicken work with Windows 8? I have not been able to get Quickbooks to work on windows 8 and thought this might be a better plan,Y,"It works. I, too, had issues with getting QB to work. I discovered that Windows 8 has its own anti-virus/malware enabled by default. Once I found out how to disable that, I reinstalled QB, reenabled the protection and QB works with no problem."
6583,yes/no,B008RA5A00,Is it still useful if I don't want to connect to online banking accounts?,Y,"Yes it is, but the online banking is great because that balances your accounts as you go and fixes your mistakes before they become an annoyance. It is one of the features that got me into this. I used to use Microsoft Money when it was available and I got spoiled by the efficiency of the online banking feature."
6584,yes/no,B008RA5A00,is the mobile portion of this program an offshoot of Mint...looks a lot like it and seems to have the same problems?,?,"My recommendation would be to stay away from Quicken altogether. I had nothing but problems with both the desktop and mobile apps. To answer your question, it looks a lot like Mint, which I've never been crazy about either."
6585,open-ended,B008RA5A00,How many computers can Quicken be loaded?,,3
6586,open-ended,B008RA5DIE,"I am buying first software of this type for new business. Based on the reviews, I am confused, for a first timer should I buy 2013 or 2012?",,"Hi, I've used Quickbooks over 20 years; the answer is, it depends- if you will use any of Quickbooks/Intuit's related services, such as payroll, credit card processing, integrated online banking services, etc., then you MUST GET 2013 version, as these services will no longer be compatible with 2012 (or any earlier) versions as of may 31, 2013. if you do not want to integrate your online banking into QB, and have no need of payroll service, credit card processing service (or use outside companies for those things), then 2012 will be a little bit of savings. But if you plan to be in business in 3 years, you might as well bite the bullet now and get 2013 since they will undoubtedly force the same kind of upgrade in another 2-3 years."
6587,open-ended,B008RA5DIE,"I am a first time landlord, will this work for record keeping? (Depreciation &amp; ??) for taxes?",,Yes it will
6588,yes/no,B008RA5DIE,IS THIS A CD?,Y,Yes there is a CD you insert and download to your computer.
6589,open-ended,B008RA5DIE,What's worse- the product or the customer support?,,"R Moore, I am so sorry to hear about your experience with us and QuickBooks Pro 2013. You were expecting a flawless conversion and instead you had multiple issues. I would love to get you in touch with the right person who could assist you. Would you please email me your contact information to Customer_Loyalty@intuit.com Attn:Drea? It would also help if you could include any error messages or screen shots of the issues you are having. Thank you, Andrea Rahn, QuickBooks Customer Care"
6590,yes/no,B008RA5DIE,can i load this on my desk top and my laptop as long as i only use one at a time,?,No. Legally you are suppose to have a multi-user copy of the software. I believe if you have an external hard drive you can load the software on it and use it on both. Check with QuickBooks customer service to be sure.
6591,yes/no,B008RA5DIE,can i use this for two different companies?,Y,Yes you can
6592,open-ended,B008RA5DIE,how do you use quickbooks to track donors for a church,,"If you receive cash, check, or credit card donations from donors or members, you can enter these revenues as donations in QuickBooks. Use the donation (sales receipt) form instead of merely entering a deposit; you can then track your donations by type, program, or source. As a result, when you use the donation form instead of deposits, your Biggest Donors/Grants report will include the donations. In addition, other sales and item reports are available. To do this task Go to the Nonprofit menu and click Enter Donations (Sales Receipts). Click the Customer:Job drop-down arrow and choose the donor/grant. Click Add New if the donor/grant is not listed, and add the donor (customer) or grant (job) to QuickBooks. In the Item column, choose an item that corresponds to the type of donation. You can select one of the options in the Item List or you can add a new item to use for the donation. To set up a new item, go to the Lists menu and click Item List. Click Item at the bottom of the list and click New. Click the Type drop-down list and choose Service. Click the Account drop-down list and choose the corresponding account. Choose a name that matches the corresponding account; for example, a Donation item associated with the Grants income account. In the Class column, select the appropriate fund or project or add a new class to track the donation to a new fund or project. Enter the amount of the donation that is being applied to the fund or project (class), as specified by the donor. (Optional) Click Customize to customize the donation form. If you plan to print the donation form and give it to the donor as a receipt, consider customizing it to add a personalized donor message to the form. To do so, click the Donor Message button and click Add New. Verify that all information on the form is correct. (Optional) Click Print to print a copy of the donation. If Deposit To appears at the bottom of the form, click the Deposit To drop-down list and choose the checking account to which you want to make the deposit. Note: QuickBooks processes Donations in the same way that it processes Sales Receipts. If your Sales & Customers preferences are set to ""Use Undeposited Funds as a default deposit to account,"" you will not see Deposit To on the form, and your donation checks will automatically be added to your Undeposited Funds account. In this case, remember to create a Deposit transaction to move funds from the Undeposited Funds account into your checking account. Click Save & Close or click Save & New.

6593,yes/no,B008RA5DIE,Does this version handle GST? We live in New Zealand,?,"I went in to open a new company and New Zealand isn't listed as one of the countries. It will handle GST from a USA refund, etc..."
6594,yes/no,B008RA5DIE,Does this version include payroll,?,"Yes and no. There is an employee section that will record hours and calculate pay. However, in order to use the full payroll function you must either track everything manually (what a pain) that means checking tax tables each and every time you cut a payroll check because all the tax deductions are set at zero. You have to really know your stuff. Otherwise you have to subscribe to QuickBooks Payroll Function which is an additional charge. As I mentioned, Intuit wants your money. You can get QuickBooks bundled with Intuit Enhanced Payroll through Amazon for about $100 more but be aware that enhanced payroll only handles up to 3 employees, then you pay extra for more. You can also pay Intuit monthly for the Payroll service. I don't know, but I imagine they make you upgrade yearly because of the new tax codes. Just my guess. Hope this helps."
6595,open-ended,B008RA5DIE,what are return privliges,,"I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm kind of stuck. I have to use this software to run my business. But it is sooo full of bugs! I dread the ordeal, but I will probably try to get them on the phone and try to get some commitment to fix some of the most glaring issues associated with entering Statement Charges. Having been in the industry for three decades, having released scores of hardware, software, and systems products, I am appalled that Intuit would put out such trash. Really, it's just accounting software. Long ago they had built the necessary feature set. The only reason to continue releasing new versions is to create a revenue stream. In a rational world, people would be induced to buy the new version because it contained features they wanted. That's not the case with Quickbooks. Intuit forces people to the new version by killing off features in the old version that people can't live without. There is NO technical reason why Intuit should maintain control over their customers use of the on-line banking functionality. It should just be embedded in the product. They designed it to work through their servers precisely so they could cut off access and force people to their new product. I actually don't mind paying them the money. What I really resent is that they don't have the integrity nor concern for their customers to make sure the product works before they force us to buy it. So, they put me through all kinds of hell trying to manage workarounds for their bugs and having to check and double check to make sure the information is recorded correctly. Just so they can squeeze a couple of hundred dollars out of me. That mentality offends and disgusts me."
6596,yes/no,B008RA5AWS,Can you have more than one company on this version?,Y,yes you can
6597,yes/no,B008RA5AWS,Is QB Pro 2013 with enhanced payroll offered for multi user license for 2 users,?,"It is my understanding that they offer only a single or three-user license. They are very helpful, go on-line and get their contact telephone number for sales they can give you the details"
6598,yes/no,B008RA5AWS,"Once i purchase the Quickbooks Pro 2013 with Enhanced Payroll, will i still need to purchase a year subscription ??",?,Only if you want to upgrade to unlimited employees. The Enhanced will only allow you to pay up to three employees. If you process more than three you will be charged by Quickbooks per employee.
6599,open-ended,B008RA5AWS,Can I install it on my business computer and my home computer so that I can work at home if necessary?,,"Yes. Here is the official Intuit position on this: ""With a single-user license, you can install QuickBooks on 1 computer and on 1 additional portable computer (e.g., a laptop that you own and use in your business) as long as both devices are used by the same person. ONLY that specified person can access and use QuickBooks on both computers."" My note: the second computer does NOT need to be a laptop or portable, but the rest of the conditions apply. Let me know if you need more info."
6600,open-ended,B008RA5AWS,What is the annual fee for the payroll for three or more?,,"Extra $100 for 4+ employees. I just called. It's a bit of a hassle if you already have a payroll subscription, like I do. First you have to cxl your current subscription, then install the payroll disc and then call and they charge you the full whack ($429) for enhanced payroll, then credit back the value they assign to the enhanced payroll of 3 or fewer employees ($329). SO, if you get the enhanced payroll for less than $329 off the shelf (i.e. Costco or Amazon), then you decide if it's worth the hassle. From everything I've read, the 2013 QB Pro is not something to be super excited about, and may even boggle your brain due to poorer visual interface, new report menu format, etc. I'm thinking about getting the Value pack and if I can do the payroll only, and without simultaneously upgrading the QB Pro, then that's what I'll do for now."
6601,open-ended,B008RA5AWS,2 part problem: The payroll checks I just processed didn't have any taxes taken out. Went into QB to fix and my company doesn't exist. How to fix?,,I hope you do back up. I would think your company has disappeared so you'll have to do a restore:( Good Luck. Ask again if you need more info. Michael
6602,open-ended,B008RA5AWS,"I will run payroll on office computer and do all other accounting, invoicing, reports, etc on my home lap top. how to sync the payroll info to home?",,I believe you will have to backup QB to zip drive at the office and bring the zip drive home to update QB there.
6603,open-ended,B008RA5AWS,"When purchasing the Enhanced Payroll (1 employee)does it give me the 1st yr subscription with it, or is it additional $ for subscribing?",,Yes it includes a 1 yr subscription. I find this amazing because Quckbooks was going to charge me in Oct. $349.00 for my one year but I saved that by buying the QB's Pro 2013 upgrade and the one year P/R. I guss I will buy a payroll package from Amazon each year now.
6604,open-ended,B008RA5AWS,If we purchase 3 user licenses does that mean three people can use the system and on 6 different compurters 3 desktop and 3 portable,,"I don't think you will able to do that, you might call quickbooks."
6605,open-ended,B008RA5AWS,how do you know if software processes 0-3 employees versus unlimited ?,,The answer is on your payroll key. It says unlimited or 0-3 employees
6606,yes/no,B008RA5EOM,Can Quickbooks premier non profit be downloaded on more than one computer?,?,Yes it can but they will not talk to one another when changes or updates are made. You will have to back up and update each machine for consistant data. Unless you install it on a server drive in your office then you can load it on multiple PC's and they all talk to the same database. Hope this helped. :-)
6607,open-ended,B008RA5EOM,What kind of reports can be prepared?,,"It will prepare just about any report that you desire such as balance sheet, income statement, a/r and a/p reports, cash flow statements, projections, monthly and quarterly statements. You can export information into excel to make a custom report. I hope this is helpful."
6608,yes/no,B008RA5EOM,can you do payroll through quickbooks premier non profit,?,Yes but you do need to subscription to payroll feature.
6609,open-ended,B008RA5EOM,How do I create individual year end contribution letters?,,I don't know. I couldn't get that far in making the program work and sent it back for a refund.
6610,open-ended,B008RA5EOM,How does one create quarterly statements as well as year ending for church members?,,"As long as the data has been entered all along, it is very easy to set up custom reports. Just go to reports, create something with the fields you want and asve it as a favorite."
6611,open-ended,B008RA5EOM,What kind of graphs can it do and also how advanced is the donor part?,,There are both pie charts and regular charts and the donor reports are very good as you can do all or one at a time.
6612,yes/no,B008RA5EOM,will the premier nonprofit 2013 function properly with windows xp home edition operating system?,Y,I am using Windows 7. In the software box it said it works with windows XP (sp3).
6613,yes/no,B008RA5EOM,Does this come with a 60 days money back guarantee?,?,I think that's what it was as I had no problem returning it.
6614,yes/no,B008RA5EOM,can i track inventory,N,no you need one of the other editions of quickbooks for inventory control
6615,open-ended,B008RA5EOM,Does this come as a emailed download or is there a disk?,,You can get both ways. I bought mine at Office Max but it can also be downloaded. It is not as easy as you would think to use without any accounting experience.
6616,open-ended,B008RA5ELK,"Are the bugs now fixed in Quicken Premier for the PC or are people having major problems with it as of July, 2013?",,Updating from Quicken 2006 to Quicken Premier 2013 was pretty painless for me. I did have to rename a couple of my accounts but that was about it.
6617,open-ended,B008RA5ELK,"I try launching Kindle for windows 8 and now it says that it encountered an error to restart [108] I restart it and nothing, uninstalled it and re-installed it and nothing does any one have any idea what this could be due to?",,I know zero about a kindle. Sorry
6618,open-ended,B008RA5ELK,How do I get Quicken Premier for Mac? I already mistakenly ordered Quicken Deluxe for Windows.,,The only thing Quicken makes that works on a Mac is Quicken Essentials.
6619,yes/no,B008RA5ELK,"Can I install this program on more than one computer when I buy it? I have it on desktop, but want to put it on my laptop and my daughter's for travel",?,You can install the program up to three computers with the same operating system. As for your data files you have to transfer them to the other computers but they will not sync up with the other computers. If your daughters data is separate from your data she should be good to go as far as I know.
6620,open-ended,B008RA5ELK,How many computers may I install this program?,,"As far as I know, you do not have a limit. You will however have to register the software with each install. I have it on two pcs myself. I hope this works."

Then, it will work fine."
6623,yes/no,B008RA5ELK,Is promotion BTTG35QK available for downloads?,N,"I don't know if the promotion is available, but I do know the mobile app is beyond poor. Do not purchase if you wish to use Quicken on a mobile device."

I can't directly answer your returnable question specifically for QP2013, but to my dismay I discovered Amazon refunded ONLY 50% of my cost when I returned my UNOPENED TurboTax 2010 Premier software (I had screwed up and ordered Premier when I actually wanted TTax 2010 Deluxe). Based on my TTax2010P experience, you can expect only a partial refund from Amazon - check their Terms & Conditions."
6625,open-ended,B008RA5ELK,"Are the bugs now fixed in Quicken Premier for the PC or are people having major problems with it as of July, 2013?",,Updating from Quicken 2006 to Quicken Premier 2013 was pretty painless for me. I did have to rename a couple of my accounts but that was about it.

Is this true?",,"Yes, Intuit will still provide support even though you don't purchase the product directly from them. We have had no problem with calling them up and asking for assistance. You get the actual QuickBooks Pro 2013 - 3 User product."
6635,yes/no,B008RA5DIY,can I get on from a remote location as long as only 2 others are on?,?,The short answer is yes you can. You have to have a server set up (which you must have done) and be able to get through your firewall. Perhaps you have security set up already and will need to use tunneling software from a remote location.
6636,open-ended,B008RA5DIY,Is this an actual disc or download only? I really want/need the disc,,This is a disc.
6637,yes/no,B008RA5DIY,can be installed on mac computer,Y,"The Mac platform requires the Mac version of QBooks. It has the capability of converting the data back and forth between the Mac and PC versions if required. There are also a few functionality and feature differences between the Mac and PC versions, but they are pretty close."
6638,yes/no,B008RA5DIY,"If we purchase the actual disc, are we able to download also?",?,"I think that is one for Quicken staff. I would think it is one or the other. Disk or download. Not sure, but disk is sometimes a little higher price than download. I choose disk because I move around to different machines and I think it would be less hassle than placing or removing the licenses on those machines."
6639,open-ended,B008RA5DIY,We recently bought Quickbooks Pro 2013 3-user. Can we buy single user version and have all 4 people working in the same company file at the same time?,,"No, it is not possible for the 4 users to work at the same time. You definitely would need a multi user version."
6640,open-ended,B008RVYYZ6,"What does ""Old Version"" mean?",,"I assume it is because it's from 2012 despite this is the latest version. Just ignore it please,I guess someone made a mistake."
6641,open-ended,B008RVYYZ6,contain VFP 9.0,,"VFP 9.0 is only available through the MSDN subscription. If you purchase visual studio with MSDN, you can download VFP 9.0 through MSDN. Microsoft will probably stop it at some stage, but not sure when that is. VFP is not on the physical media. You may be able to purchase the MSDN subscription seperately, but you may get a good deal by purchasing the MSDN subscription with Visual Studio. I recommend you double checking that MS hasn't withdrawn it from MSDN subscription, and then checking your best way to get it. For me, the most economical way was to purchase VS with MSDN subscription. Hope that helps. Good luck."
6642,yes/no,B008RVYYZ6,Does this include Windows 7?,Y,"Yes, when it says MSDN that includes ""platforms"" i.e.operating systems."
6643,yes/no,B008RVYYZ6,Does this come with a 2-year subscription?,N,"No, this is only a one-year subscription. You will have to purchase a renewal one year after activation if you want continued access."

6645,open-ended,B008RVYYZ6,Is it a renewal or not&#x61F;,,This is a new License. It is not a renewal because it does not include an MSDN subscription.
6646,open-ended,B008RW3XIO,What extra do we get with the MSDN subscription ? Does the VS pro has a in depth help function or that comes with MSDN subscription? Thanks,,"The Visual Studio product has an extensive Help utility. However, this is the same documentation that is available publicly online through Microsoft's website. The MSDN subscription entitles you to live support (via chat or phone), automatic updates, access to the Team Foundation Server (TFS) portal, a starter account for Windows Azure (""cloud""), e-learning opportunities and more. Using the TFS portal is particularly useful if managing a team of developers (2 or more). If you are a good self-learner, developing for personal use only, or you are a team of one, the benefits of Visual Studio can be realized without the MSDN subscription."
6647,yes/no,B008RW3XIO,Does this include MSDN specifically the operating systems portion?,?,"The sub $500 Visual Studio Pro 2012 does not include operating systems or MSDN, just the usual API and tools help files.

6649,open-ended,B008RW3XIO,c++ is included?,,Visual Studio Pro 2012 does compile native C++ and includes an updated MFC library with many bug fixes.
6650,open-ended,B008RW3XIO,Does VS 2012 require a 64 bit OS?,,"No, it will work with 32 bit or 64 bit. VS is a resource hog and will run better with more memory, staying with the 32 bit limits your memory so that alone should make you consider moving to 64 bit for a development machine."
6651,yes/no,B008RW3XIO,Does this work with Windows8 as well?,Y,"Yes, this product will work with Windows 7 or 8, both 32 & 64-bit from the same installation DVD included."
6652,yes/no,B008RW3XIO,Visual Studio 2013 is currently in Release Candidate. Is there an upgrade path to 2013 once it is release?,?,"Hi Ted, Not sure on this one. In the past there has been upgrade pricing, however I have not seen it on the last release. I think Microsoft is slowly adopting a just pay the price policy. I used to wait and buy the older version when the next one was coming out to just pay the upgrade price, but I think they have caught on! John"
6653,open-ended,B008RW3XIO,is this a retail dvd version or a fake pirate version where you just supply the license code?,,This is the official version from Microsoft. You'll get the DVD and license key all in the box.
6654,yes/no,B008RW3XIO,"Is a version of SQL Server included, e.g. such as SQL Developer?",?,"Only SQL Server Express, which is too limited. You can get SQL Developer for $59 directly from Microsoft. It has all SQL Server capabilities but only supports a single user - works very well for development or personal database use."
6655,yes/no,B008RW3XIO,is it come with DVD-ROM?,Y,Yes
6656,yes/no,B008RZMSYG,"Hello,can i install this OS X an my Macbook Pro 4.1 (2006) because i have couple of installation CD and all of them doesn't work an my Mac ?",Y,"Dear Jasmin: I have a 2006 Mac Book Pro and the problem with reading the discs is that you don't have enough RAM. Those old MACS have very little random access memory that is completely free. I had to order a little 2 gig hard drive to add to my 2006 MAC which was really easy. I got it off Amazon - I can give you the info if you want. When I was upgrading to Snow Leopard I was able to use an external disc drive and load the new OS on the computer using the disc that I got off Amazon. However, if you are having a tough time with this...you may need to copy all the discs to a flash drive and load them off of that. Hope this helps."
6657,open-ended,B008RZMSYG,I am on Safari OS 10.5.8 Can I use this Program?,,It depends on your machine. I got 2 wrong answers from the apple toll free line. Go to powermax.com and call their toll free #. The people that work there really know their stuff and were the ones that told me my iMac could handle snow leopard.
6658,yes/no,B008RZMSYG,Could I use this to switch from windows to mac os x.,?,You can if you have the right resources. Google your PC model and hackintosh to see if anyone has a method for your PC. Most can use iBoot with this cd or Nawcom. Good luck. Takes a while to get right... :)

6660,yes/no,B008RZMSYG,Can I side boot this with Windows? Right now my main OS is Windows 8. My processor is an i7,?,"Apple Technical Support will be the best source to get a definitive and reliable answer to your technical questions, and they will be happy to answer them. Mac OS X 10.6.3 Snow Leopard comes with 90 days of free technical support from them, and they will answer pre-sales questions related to the product, before you buy it. Best Regards, Macintosh Computer Services"
6661,yes/no,B008RZMSYG,Can I install this on a PC?,?,Its only for Mac Intel's
6662,yes/no,B008RZMSYG,will this do a factory recovery on a white macbook 2009,?,"The original OS shipped on the. 2009 MacBook was 10.5 so snow leopard @ 10.6 will feel right at home. 1. Start from the disc ( hold down C key till apple appears. 2. In upper left corner open disk utility and run disk repair. 3. Close disk utility and run installer. 4. load a full (not custom install) of all parts. That's a factory install 5. Restart and have a happy Mac Note: with snow leopard you can go to the apple site and download OS 10.10.1 which your Mac can handle, enjoy!"
6663,yes/no,B008RZMSYG,Will OS 10.6.3 work with an IBM Power PC processer as built in to my iBook G4?,N,No it is only for Mac
6664,open-ended,B008RZMSYG,Can this be installed as either a 32 bit or 64 bit version?,,"As long as it's on a X86 platform and your running mult core processor yes it will by default run in 64 bit mode. I'm running it on a Dell that runs 2 processors and it's fine. I did have problems finding some drivers, but went to Dell.com and got the specs for the machine and then went to the individual vendors site and got them. Good luck"
6665,open-ended,B008RZMSYG,Will this OS work with AMD FX series processors or is Intel required?,,I have it running on an AMD and it seems to be fine can't say for sure its a Dell so that's the best I can say with a Intel board.
6666,open-ended,B008S0J2R6,Am I understanding this product correctly? This is a 1 year subscription. What is the annual renewal fee?,,I bought directly from Quickbooks 3 days ago and they told me the renewal in 1 year would be $110.
6667,open-ended,B008S0J2R6,"I plan on buying Quickbooks 2013 for Mac, Office 2011 for Home &amp; Business for Mac Is Quickbooks Quickstart compatible with an I Mac?",,"Even if it is, you don't want to buy it - you need to download from QB to get any support at all from QB. In addition - this is NOT the QB program you may be familiar with - it is a shell of the program and completely worthless. It will allow you to make about 10 invoices. Then you will have to pay the $200 to upgrade. Find the program that you will need and skip this worthless waste of money. Is it compatible - possibly. If it isn't you will not be able to get any support to fix it."
6668,yes/no,B008S0J2R6,is quickbooks enhanced compatible with it,N,"no, nothing is compatible with it, it is the starter program, it resets your data to zero, don't pay money for this"
6669,yes/no,B008S0J2R6,Does this work with Quickbooks Basic Payroll?,N,"No, it is the most basic and isn't even a program, it is the online key to storing your company records online. It will let you record income and expenses online."
6670,yes/no,B008SCNF1S,can this be used as an replacement,?,Replacement? It is a year's subscription to Norton Antivirus.

6672,yes/no,B008SCNF1S,can this beused with tablets,Y,"Yes, it looks as though you can use this with tablets. The instructions inside the box include a paragraph on installing Norton Antivirus 2013 onto a ""Netbook, Tablet, or on a PC with no optical drive"" as long as the device meets the system requirements of Norton Antivirus. I think you can find the system requirements on Amazon.com's description of details."

What do I do now? Doni,,"You can either go to Norton's website and use their computer virus removal tool which is free to do, or give Norton a call and they will assist you.

What does 1 user mean?,,"You will want to choose this one, as it covers the number of cumputers you will download it too. Just ignore the number of users issues, if you are ok with sharing the same passwords."
6681,open-ended,B008SCNCTI,"What does this mean ""1 user/3PC"" ?? Can it be downloaded to 3 computers of different family members?",,"That just means all 3 installs must be tied to the same Norton Account. Any 3 computers, as long as they're not running Windows 8.1."
6682,yes/no,B008SCNCTI,Can I use this to renew an existing subscription?,?,"Yes....that is what I did on one of my laptops. Once you have paid for the software, on the invoice the Registration Code is provided. Just enter in the code and your software will be good for another 365 days."
6683,yes/no,B008SCNCTI,is this for a year,Y,"Yes, it was for a year."
6684,open-ended,B008SCNCTI,why does my screen blink,,"To be honest, no idea. I have never had an issue with this product. I tried a net search and everyone says it sounds like your video card might have issues. It may just be a driver update, try that first. But otherwise, this program shouldn't be the issue."
6685,open-ended,B008SCNCTI,What is safe library,,"I am not familiar with safe library, but Norton offers an online identity safe to store login information."
6686,yes/no,B008SCNCTI,Can I use the 3 pc version on my Kindle fire?,?,"As far as Norton is concerned, I see no problem. However, I would check with Amazon/Kindle to see if that program is compatible with your device first."
6687,yes/no,B008SCNCTI,Can I use this to upgrade/replace the 2012 version? It's about to expire.,Y,"Yes, I just did. Just becareful ""renewing"" so you don't accidentally purchase the upgrade twice, (once from Amazon and once from Norton's website!).. you should only have to enter the Product Code after hittting the renew button. If it tells you to make a $ purchase on Norton's website, you're on the wrong page!"
6688,yes/no,B008SCNCTI,"Can I use this in India? because it is written in product details that ""This item is available only to customers located in the United States""",?,"I'm sorry, but I do not have the answer for that. You might check with support with Norton or Amazon."
6689,open-ended,B008SCNJJQ,"2. NAV recently upgraded itself to its 2013 'look' then subscrip ran out, don't I just need a reg code for 1 year?",,Yes. The reg codes will work across versions now. You can get a one year if you like but they also have multi year available at a better price (per year) then you don't have to worry about it as often.
6690,open-ended,B008SCNJJQ,Do all licenses have to be used immediately or are there numbers that can be used at a later to update current product?,,I loaded the program over a couple of days so Im guessing not.
6691,open-ended,B008SCNJJQ,1. How do you distribute it to other computers? (Burn a CD or can you use a jump drive?),,There is a CD included that starts the process. Then the registration that works on what ever number of computers your purchase the softward for. Does that help? The thing to remember is that the clock starts as soon as you download it to the first computer. The nice thing is that it is so much cheaper and all your systems are on the same schedule.
6692,open-ended,B008SCMUUA,hey there - is this a download version? i only want a product key; i have downloaded a trial version and dont need shipping. just the key.please advs,,It was a downloaded version so if I remember correctly it just loads. Since I brought it for 3 users the anti-virus software was stored in Amazon library so I later downloaded it to a second labtop. I think the activation key is posted in the library because I needed it the second time I downloaded since it will load the trail version and then activate the full version when you put in the activation key.
6693,open-ended,B008SCMUUA,what is procedure for putting this on the second computer (an Asus Netbook)?,,"Lindara, Only if you bought for multiple uses can you install on your netbook. Symantec (Norton Internet Security) has the product for sale as a single, 3 pcs & multiple. The product key will only register just that many pc's. Ex: I have 3 pc's, I purchase the 1 user, 3 pc package and install 3 times with product code. You could probably install it on your netbook, but it won't verify or download updates to stay concurrent with new virus etc. Hope this helped."
6694,open-ended,B008SCMUUA,My new computer - Windows 8. This will be the first Internet Security program to install. Does Window 8 have protection already that needs to uninstalled? How?,,"I'm not positive, since I use Windows 7. If Windows 8 has anti-virus protection, and I think it does, it would be called Microsoft Security Essentials. If it's installed, it MUST be removed before installing Norton Internet Security. To do so, go to the Control Panel. Then click on Add/Remove Programs and uninstall Microsoft Security Essentials. Once done, immediately install Norton Internet Security. Hope this helps. Tony"
6695,yes/no,B008SCMUUA,can you buy the download and get a C D disc to,?,I don't think so; it's one or the other.
6696,open-ended,B008SCMUUA,"When you purchase the Norton Internet Security 2013 - 1 User / 3 PC, do you also receive a CD? Can you share 2 PC with family not in the same house?",,"The answer is yes to both questions. You do get a disk/CD in the box, (but you don't actually need it if you download the Norton IS free trial directly from the internet. Then, when the trial ends you can enter your new KEY #, it's in the box with the disk/CD, then you have a full year of use and support. And yes, you can give away the other two copies to anyone you like, and they would use your disk/CD and KEY #, or download the trial and enter your KEY # when the trial ends. Hope this answers your questions. Clickonmartin@cox.net Another tip: to maximize your subscription, never renew until the last day, because, when you renew you only get a year from the renewal date. Plus, never renew directly with Norton as you will pay the full price. Better to wait for a sale at your local retailer, or buy another norton from Amazon. Good luck!"
6697,yes/no,B008SCMUUA,"I already purchased this last year, I am about a week away from having to renew again. I don't see a 2014 version. Can I renew with this 2013 again?",?,This is my understanding that anytime you buy a antivirus software with 1 yr validity then you will get all the update of that software from the day you first installed till next 1 yr. If it is 2 yr validity then you get update for 2yrs. So even if the 2014 version is not available yet you will get 2014 update on your 2013 version when available. But this is my understanding. I may be wrong. So it will be better if you check with Norton.
6698,yes/no,B008SCMUUA,Does the download version of this software come with a one-year subscription?,Y,"Yes you do receive a one year subscription with the downloaded version. And, this version has 3 licenses, which allows you to install it on 3 different PC/Laptops."
6699,open-ended,B008SCMUUA,for how many years can you use this product?,,Good for one year. can be renewed but it is usually cheaper to upgrade to the next year's edition. You may have to shop for a good deal - I paid $30.00 on Amazon - list was some 70.00 (not that anyone pays that amount). BJs warehouse had it on Black Friday for 20.00.
6700,yes/no,B008SCMUUA,will this version work on win 8.1?,Y,Yes
6701,open-ended,B008SCMUUA,"how can you get Norton Security to stop putting up ""Security Alerts"" that cover your home page and cannot be taken off without renewing?",,"I haven't had that problem and when it is time to renew, I don't. I go out and buy a newer version, usually from Amazon as it is cheaper to do that than do their $49/year renewal. Used to be $19/year and then it was worth it, but every year they increased it to the point where it was more expensive than buying a new version."
6702,yes/no,B008TN83PO,"I have SketchBook Pro 5.5.2 (2012) running on my Windows 7. If I purchase this software, which says Sketch Book Pro 6 upgrade, will it upgrade to 6?",?,It always has for me to date. Sketch on.
6703,yes/no,B008TN83PO,can sketchbook pro 6 work on windows 8.1? i'm trying the free trial and it's working fine so far,Y,Yes it will work on Windows 8.1. I use it all the time and it works great.
6704,yes/no,B008TN83PO,Will this program work on Windows *?,Y,"I have it on my laptop and my desktop and it works great on both. If you want any tips, check out Paris Cristou online. He is great."
6705,open-ended,B008TN83PO,I bought sketchbook pro 5.5 from mac appstore. How can I upgrade it? Buying this allows me to do that?,,Well that is a good question.... My previous version was a present but the person said they purchased it through Apple Store on line and bought this new version through Amazon as I wanted the new features that came out. It came with serial numbers so I had no problem installing it. I love this application... However I have read where some people couldn't upgrade their MAC store version as Autodesk licenses are different... Good luck!
6706,yes/no,B008TN83PO,Is the Upgrade an add on to a current program? If so I bought the wrong thing because my daughter doesnt curently have anything like it.,Y,"It is the same thing. I got dupped into buying the program and the upgrade. I ended up with two copies of the same program. By the way, Sketchbook Pro is a great program. It is extremely easy to use and you can do almost everything the more expensive programs can do for a tenth of the cost."
6707,yes/no,B008TN81ZG,Can I use this way? trial download + cd rom product key = surface pro,Y,"Yes,, I downloaded the trial then bought the software on amazon and when the CD arrived entered the product key / serial number from the CD and it all worked fine. Hope that helps"
6708,yes/no,B008TN81ZG,Has anyone tried using this with Windows 8 yet?,Y,"Yes it works fine. Installed very easily and I installed it on a 64 bit version of Windows. Once you finish the install and start the program up for the first time, the program will ask you to download an update to version 6.01 - have fun creating-"
6709,open-ended,B008TN81ZG,I know nothing of these drawing programs. How exactly do you draw with a computer? Having trouble imagining it with a laptop. Please advise.,,"There are many software programs that allow you to paint or draw on a computer. In these programs you first create a surface to work on. This usually consists of a blank white area. To draw or paint you would then click on a tool option such as a brush or pencil, select a color, and then click and drag your the cursor over the top of the canvas. You can draw with a mouse--but it is awkward for many reasons. Most people buy a digital tablet which comes with a pen (stylus) that controls the cursor on their computer. With a stylus you have many more options on how the strokes are made and it is much easier to draw with because you hold the stylus like you would a regular pen. Some people, like myself, have a pressure sensitive laptop that comes with a stylus. This enables me to use the stylus directly on the monitor of my laptop. I can adjust settings so that if I push harder on the stylus my brush stroke gets darker, or wider, or both. That is something you cannot do with a mouse. To change the line thickness with a mouse you have to go to the brush size and change it. Digital painting is a very big area right now. It is amazing what some people can create. I hope this helps."
6710,open-ended,B008TN81ZG,Can this be installed on one computer only? If I install this on my current computer and get a new computer down the road will I have to re-purchase?,,"No, you shouldn't have an issue. In general, once you purchase software that requires you to enter a ""key or validation code"" during installation, such as SP6, you can install it on any computer you want. After all, you own it, and Autodesk (as well as most software manufacturers) realizes people buy new computers. You generally run into installation limitations when you purchase software for business use or buy network licenses."
6711,yes/no,B008TN81ZG,Is there anywhere I could find a digital download of this software to purchase?,?,Try this: http://store.autodesk.com/store/adskus/en_US/pd/productID.254993700?mktvar002=store_affiliate_wwm_amer_us_nc__SktchBkPro6pdp
6712,yes/no,B008TN81ZG,can you create vector illustrations with this software (like you would in illustrator)?. Thanks.,?,No. It cant as it is a raster imaging program. You will have to either use Illustrator or Inkscape.
6713,yes/no,B008TN81ZG,can this be used with a drawing pad like bamboo,Y,"Yes. A year ago I had a Bamboo Create and even hand gestures (rotate, pan, etc) working nicely."
6714,open-ended,B008TN81ZG,"Amazon's initial Requirements show Windows Vista, yet later under Product Description, there's no mention of it----will it work with Vista?",,"That's weird, it says XP and 7, but not Vista. http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/sketchbook_pro_6_system_requirements_final.pdf. However, Anthony62 does say he's done just that: http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Installation-Licensing/Windows-8-and-Sketchbook-Pro-6/td-p/3678206 Autodesk is rather conservative in their leaps forward. Their releases will be compatable but they're careful about saying so. I've been around Autodesk products for almost 20 years--I'd make the jump. Later, you can upgrade to Win7 64bit and really cruise."
6715,yes/no,B008TN81ZG,Is it easy to use and comprehensive for drawing only,?,"I haven't been using it lately. Best bet is check out videos on ""Utube"", lots of informative stuff there. Also do search of manufacturer's website which is: ""Autodesk"" and search w name of program: ""SketchBook Pro 6"". Lot of tutorials and examples showing it in action, which will be much better than words."

6778,open-ended,B008U5EL98,what is the quality of the green backdrop?,,"That's a feature I don't think I'll ever use, so I couldn't tell you."
6779,yes/no,B008U5EL98,does this support mt2s files?,?,"Hi Dakota, if your camera uses AVCHD (typically stored on an SD card), then the answer is yes. The MT2S file type is primarily associated with 'AVCHD'. AVCHD is a high-definition digital video format that supports 1080i and 720p with a reasonably small file size. AVCHD files are based on the MPEG4 CODEC. AVCHD video files can be burned to Blu-ray discs and played in compatible devices, such as Blu-ray disc players and the Sony PlayStation3. Various video programs can edit or convert this file format which is generally used by Sony and some Panasonic video cameras. I have found that Pinnacle 16 can import almost all video formats currently around. Hope this helps."
6780,yes/no,B008U5EL5C,Does 16 Ultimate work with .mts file formats?,?,"Yes it does work with that file format. However I do NOT recommend this product, way too many bugs!"
6781,yes/no,B008U5EL5C,will this work on windows XP,?,I have not tried Pinnacle 16 with Windows XP but have used it with Windows 7. Pinnacle 12 works with Windows XP.
6782,yes/no,B008U5EL5C,Will this work with Windows 8?,Y,Yes it will. But I had to buy a new computer with a 64 bit version of windows 8 and a top video card with lots of memory ( 8 gig ). Good thing I needed a new computer anyway.
6783,yes/no,B008U5EL5C,Does this program support picture in picture and quick time and mpg4 formats,Y,Yes cyberlink powerdirector 13 ultra is better.
6784,open-ended,B008U5EL5C,"Hi. Does an external capture device come with this ultimate package like it has in the past? If not, can I use the one I have from Pinnacle v12?",,"It does but it's a horrendous program I would avoid at all costs. It will use 100% of your computer resources and crash routinely with Windows 7 64 bit. Try Adobe, iMovie or final cut pro"
6785,yes/no,B008U5EL5C,Does this program support picture in picture and quick time and mpg4 formats,Y,yes it does but very bad support and a lot of crashes
6786,yes/no,B008U5EL5C,Can I install this on more than one computer?,?,I installed pinnacle 16 ultimate in my 2 computers without any problems more than one time
6787,yes/no,B008U5EL5C,Does Pinnacle Studio 16 work with Mac?,?,You need to buy for Mac and this work
6788,open-ended,B008U5EL5C,What are the dimensions of the green screen that is included?,,I never opened the screen as it was tightly wrapped. I assume that it was of the same demensions as the screen I received with Pinnacle 14 about 6ft x 6ft. Agter a lot of reading on green screen an experimenation I have found that larger screens are needed along with good lighting. Look on Amazon for green screens and you will find some good set-ups. The screen you will receive will work for simple projects. George
6789,yes/no,B008U5EL5C,Can you plug in Twixtor?,?,"I'm not sure, but I would avoid this product. It is so glitchy that it is useless."
6790,open-ended,B008V4S1GC,How much RAM is needed for this product?,,You will need 2 gbs of ram for windows 7 and Vista. But for windows XP 512 mbs of ram.That what is on the side on the box.
6791,yes/no,B008V4S1GC,my computer is a netbook meaning i dont have a cd reader. does this product include a key I can enter to download it?,Y,Yes it does.
6792,open-ended,B008V4S1GC,what's the difference between Internet Security and Total Protection ? Anyone know ?,,"Total Protection has 3 add'l. things, as listed on the box. Actually, if you go to the McAfee website, you can do a comparison there. But, these are the add'l. things: 1)Encrypt sensitive documents-even photos-in a password-protected vault on your PC to keep your identity safe from hacking as well as theft or loss of your PC. 2)Easily and safely shorten and share website links to Facebook, Twitter, or email. 3) Advanced SiteAdvisor LIVE software checks and alerts you to risky websites you receive in social media, email, and instant messages and blocks online phishing attempts to steal your personal and confidential information. Those are the 3 things. However, in my opinion, Internet Security pretty much has those things (like SiteAdvisor) and again, in my opinion, they overlap w/the 3 additions that are in Total Protection."
6793,open-ended,B008V4S1GC,How long is the subscription for updates? 1 year?,,It's just a one year subscription. It starts counting down the day it's installed. About a week before it expires your computer will pop up a message that it's about to expire and you can immediately renew online but the online prices are usually $20 more than what you can buy the disc for on Amazon.
6794,open-ended,B008V4S1GC,when i go to a favorite website will it log in the ID and password like Norton does ?,,"It seems to me that each website is different. Even before I got McAfee, some of them would store my info and some sites I'd have to log into each time. I haven't really noticed anything different. Sorry, don't know if that answered your question or not."
6795,yes/no,B008V4S1GC,does this product automaticly put in ID and password for you,N,"No. You don't use an ID and Password to access your McAfee Internet Security software. If you mean does it automatically sign you in to other websites, etc., the answer is also no, which is a good thing. However, the install is VERY easy and once you're a user of it, when you buy a new version next year and install it, it will automatically uninstall any traces of the older version(s). Great product."
6796,yes/no,B008V4SFWW,Is it going to clean my computer from viruses and keep it clean of them?,Y,"Yes it will that's what its for, and if you have viruses already it should be able to clean them up to thanks ."
6797,open-ended,B008V4SFWW,"I need your help, I throw away the box that came my antivirus and now I can not I locate the serial to install it, what should I do",,"Sorry, the serial number is only on the box. You may get help from the vendor you purchased it from. You may have to purchase a second copy."
6798,open-ended,B008V4SFWW,does the activation code present in the box along with CD? or only activation code present in the box?,,Mine had both
6799,yes/no,B008V4SFWW,Is it possible to install on a PC without an Internet connection?,?,You can but will only get the basic software with no updated definitions. But it makes no sense to install on a computer without Internet connection.
6800,open-ended,B008V4SFWW,When does the one year start for each of the 3 PCs?,,When you install it on the first PC. The registration for the original install is the subscription period for all 3.
6801,yes/no,B008V4SFWW,Does the product Include the installable CD/DVD ?,?,Yes this one did
6802,yes/no,B008V4SFWW,Is it going to clean my computer from viruses and keep it clean of them?,Y,"Yes it will that's what its for, and if you have viruses already it should be able to clean them up to thanks ."

6805,yes/no,B008V4SFWW,Is it possible to install on a PC without an Internet connection?,?,You can but will only get the basic software with no updated definitions. But it makes no sense to install on a computer without Internet connection.
6806,open-ended,B008V4SFWW,When does the one year start for each of the 3 PCs?,,When you install it on the first PC. The registration for the original install is the subscription period for all 3.
6807,yes/no,B008V4SFWW,Does the product Include the installable CD/DVD ?,?,Yes this one did
6808,open-ended,B008V4S4VY,"Is this a down loadable version, or do you need a CD?",,I have the CD
6809,yes/no,B008V4S4VY,"I don't need the box, only the code for activate the software. If I buy it from you, is possible that?",?,The license is only good for 1 PC. You will have to purchase a new one.
6810,open-ended,B008V4S4VY,"but it works for a calendar year , 365 days until you install or only works for the rest of 2013",,My previous version of this software ran for 365 days from install. I'm assuming the same for the 2013 version otherwise they would have real problems in selling the 2013 version for the rest of this year.
6811,open-ended,B008V4S4VY,I already have Mcafee but my subscription is expiring will this product work to update the current software I have?,,I bought McAfee Total Protection through Amazon and it upgraded my McAfee very nicely. I am completely satisfied.
6812,open-ended,B008V4S4VY,"is this good for a year? or just a ""trial version""",,For the year. After all you are paying for it. A trial version is only free for 30-days.
6813,yes/no,B008V4S4VY,Is there a McAfee for Windows 8?,Y,This runs on my Windows 8 machine just fine. Have had it running all year with no problems.
6814,yes/no,B008V4S1C6,Does this package include a subscription to updates for a year?,?,"Yes, part of the package is automatic updates to the system. All virus software MUST update frequently, or the latest problems will not be addressed."
6815,open-ended,B008V4S1C6,What is the difference besides the year in 2013 and 1014,,"I no longer use McAfee, It by far is the worst anti virus program. Save yourself a huge hassle and get Vipre. I've been using it for 2014 and got the lifetime contract and LOVE it. I truly believe that McAfee is a virus itself."
6816,yes/no,B008V4S1C6,Will this work with Windows8 ?,?,It is not tested and certified with Windows 8 but it works when installed on Windows 8.
6817,yes/no,B008V4S1C6,will these licenses work in Germany?,?,I don't know. Go to McAfee.com and contact them.
6818,open-ended,B008V4S4TQ,Is it a CD or key?,,It's a CD that comes with a code. When you register it online you can download the software from the McAfee site onto other devices without using the CD again.
6819,yes/no,B008V4S4TQ,does McAfeeTotal Protection 3PCs 2013 provide a firewall?,Y,"Yes it does. Though I haven't ever seen it function on my laptop. I guess no site has tried to hack into my system of if it did happen then it probably bypassed the firewall. however, Windows 7 OS has recognized that my system is protected by McAfee's firewall. Hope this helps."
6820,yes/no,B008V4S4TQ,Does product work totally with Windows 7- 64 bit system? [ Norton does not work TOTALLY with a 64 bit system],Y,I am not completely sure. I just know I have a Lenovo (3800?) Windows 7 and it works great. this is my second year with McAfee and I havent had any problems yet. I originally had Norton and hated it. it kept uninstalling by its self.
6821,open-ended,B008V4S4TQ,"What is the difference between 2013 and 2014? More features in 2014? Also, is there a way to upgrade to 2014 after buying 2013?",,There's a few additional features in 2014 but the main reason to buy the latest edition is the year long support for updated virus definition and many other updates as newer threats emerge. One can renew their subscription from 2013 to 2014 on the McAfee website.
6822,yes/no,B008V4S4TQ,can I use for Win 8?,?,"Have experience with Win 7, Vista, and XP only. Would not recommend this product for any system"
6823,yes/no,B008V4S4TQ,Can I use this product key to renew my subscription for year 2015?,N,No
6824,yes/no,B008V4S4TQ,Will I be able to use this 2013 version one full year from the date of purchase?,Y,Yes
6825,yes/no,B008V4S4TQ,does this work for Windows 8?...Thx,?,I am using it on 3 laptops all of them running windows 8
6826,yes/no,B008V4S4TQ,Is this a 1 yr renewal. It didn't say anything on the listing. Thanks,?,this isn't a renewal.The renewal by McAfee is more expensive than buying on the open market.I hope this helps.
6827,yes/no,B008V4S4TQ,does this work on Windows XP home edition,Y,Yes it does.
6828,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,does it have spreadsheets,Y,"yes, it does have spreadsheets, as well as presentations, templates, formulas and drawing."
6829,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,Is it compatible with Windows 7 and IE 11?,?,Works well on 7 home premium
6830,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,is this compatible with microsoft office 2010 ;,Y,I have windows 8 and it is working fine with the Microsoft pgm.
6831,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,Is it compatible with window 7,Y,"yes, I used it with windows 7"
6832,open-ended,B008XAXAC4,which download do i do when i have an hp 8.1 computer ? the mac or the pc download ?,,"I would say you probably need the pc download. It's because you have an HP and not a ""Mac"" or ""i"" computer. Those are Mac downloads."
6833,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,Does it work with Windows 8?,Y,"Yes, I'm running it on Windows 8."
6834,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,is it comparable to WordPerfect,Y,"To be quite honest, I haven't used WordPerfect very much, so I couldn't say. But I do know it has very respectable formatting abilities, nice assortment of fonts and sizes, plus a lot more other amenities I just didn't expect from a free program; there are spreadsheets, point-whatchamacallit templates, even some for making up flyers, business cards and other things. There's links to go to to get even more templates, but though they looked very interesting, I didn't have much need for them, a lot of them had to do with other languages and those techno-functions that are far beyond my ken. It's quite easy to use, also. I like Scrivener, once I got used to it, but you practically need an engineering degree to figure out how to use the damn thing. Hope that helps!"
6835,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,can I use this windows 7 64 bit,?,that is what I have....and I use it.....it is a great program...a bit different than microsoft...but actually ....more features I think....
6836,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,IS IT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 8 ?,Y,"Yes, my computer and my tablet both run using Windows 8.1. I use open office on both of them and have had no issues."
6837,yes/no,B008XAXAC4,"I need to be able to mark chapter headings, which will translate into an active table of contents when submitted for Kindle. Can AOO do that?",?,"I have not tried this myself, but I see instructions for doing this on the web here: http://www.kinworm.com/2011/01/create-your-own-kindle-ebook-using-open_30.html I searched for ""openoffice kindle table of contents"""
6838,yes/no,B008Y4I6LO,does anyone use this for fitness classes and can you set a playlist for I tunes. will it play all the songs continuous?,?,"Pitch switch is strictly a program for lowereing and raising keys of a song. It also has the abikity to change tempo, and add equilizer enhancements. Not really a player for itunes. Hope this helps."
6839,yes/no,B008Y4I6LO,Does changing a song's pitch up or down a whole step negatively affect the sound quality of the song?,?,"I don't believe so. I'm not a sound engineer, but it sounds like it was just recorded in a completely different pitch. It is incredibly simple to import and save a song. I use it to get the chords and notes out of a song in a key that I prefer to sing in."
6840,open-ended,B008Y4I6LO,Does the Mac version export/saves to WAV? and if so can I pick different bit rates?,,"I only have the PC version of PitchSwitch, which definitely works with WAV (as well as mp3, m4a, wma, aac, flac, and ogg). I would be very surprised if the Mac version did not support the same file formats, particularly since WAV is a commonly-used format."
6841,yes/no,B008Y4I6LO,Does this software work with Windows 8?,?,I would call the following number or email for technical support. They have always been very helpful to me! Tel: (905) 963-8780 Toll Free: (888) 732-6134 Email: support@inspyder.com
6842,open-ended,B008YTAGIK,Why is this so expensive? It's nearly 3x the list price.,,Some vendors add a bit over the list price from the publisher for the effort of listing the software on Amazon so it's easy for you to find. There are two editions of VMWare Fusion 6. The $130 Pro version enables you to create images. The standard $30 version only uses images created by others with a Pro license.
6843,yes/no,B008YTAGIK,Will it run on Windows XP?,N,No this is an emulator to run windows or Linux on a Mac not the other way around. But it will run windows xp on a Mac if the was what you meant.
6844,yes/no,B008YTAGIK,Does it comes with license?,?,This is the standard version and it includes the appropriate license key. Does that answer your question?
6845,open-ended,B008YTAGIK,"after I install VMWare on my Mac, then I will also need to install Windows OS before I can run/intall a Windows app?",,"Yes, you must install an OS (Windows or other) before you can run applications. VMWare just sets up the hardware emulation, it does not include operating systems."
6846,yes/no,B008YTAGIK,Will this work on Mac OSX v.10.5.8?,?,Is that OSX 10.5.8 or OSX 10.8.5? If it is 10.5 get an earlier version. Fusion 5 needs at least 10.6.
6847,open-ended,B008YTAGIK,i need to download this for a windows based virtual classroom will this corrupt any of the data on my hard drive and do i need to install windows,,"There is no reason to believe that will corrupt any of your data on the hard drive. Consider it as yet another application you just installed. It is a software layer virtualization engine that will allow you to run windows under your MAC OS and yes, you will need to install Windows as soon as you install Fusion on the hard drive. Hope this helps."
6848,yes/no,B008YTAGIK,Will this run on Yosomite?,N,No
6849,yes/no,B008YTAGIK,"Will it work on OSX 10.9.5? Since Mavericks has a few differences from Mountain Lion and other versions, I don't see how it can be upwards compatible.",?,Garbage. Deleted after one hour.
6850,open-ended,B008YTAGIK,"Can this be installed at any point in time, or does it have to be installed on a brand new mac with factory settings?",,Anytime sure.
6851,open-ended,B008YTAGIK,Can you run multiple Windows OS's? One guest win 8.1 and another guest Win 2008R2? Or does this only support one Win OS installation?,,"You can run as many as you like providing your Mac has sufficent resources to handle them all. I have a MacPro 12 Core with 48GB or Ram and can easily run three seperate Windows sessions (1 Windows 2008 R2, & 2 Windows 7), (I've never tried more). I also have a Late 2013 Core i7 MBP with 16GB of ram that runs 2 windows sessions (Win 8 and Win 7) no problem."
6852,yes/no,B008YTAKJA,does this run with yosemite,?,Yes. But not all the functions. But get the basic job done.
6853,yes/no,B008YTAKJA,Will Parallels 8 work with Maverick,?,Yeah as a matter of fact I upgraded to Parallels 9 and it also works with Mavericks. Here's a link form Parallels forums. http://forum.parallels.com/showthread.php?292009-Running-Parallels-8-on-OSX-Mavericks-possible
6854,yes/no,B008YTAKJA,Is Parallels 8 compatible with Mac OS 10.9 Maverics,?,"I've had no problem so far using Parallels 8 with Maverics. In fact, Maverics has made my 5-year-old MacBook Pro faster, with more efficient use of available memory and processing power."
6855,yes/no,B008YTAKJA,Will this work with the new Mac OSX Yosemite?,Y,"Yes, it works great on the new macs. I have not had any issues with it at all."

6857,yes/no,B008YTAKJA,Can I download free 14 day trial Parallels from website &amp; also order one from Amazon.com (Its cheap here) &amp; later install the Key in it when I get it.,?,"Yeah, we did the same thing."
6858,yes/no,B008YTAKJA,do i need to install windows operating system to use parallels on my mac?,?,"I run Windows XP, yes you need a copy of the Windows OS also. Easy to install you install Parallels first, then Windows"
6859,yes/no,B008YTAKJA,"If I install Parallells on my MAC, can I then install WordPerfect on my Mac? Pages sucks!",Y,Yes. You will need to install Parallels and then install a Windows operating system (I would recommend Windows 7) and then you can install and run Windows applications like WordPerfect.
6860,yes/no,B008YTAKJA,I see this is a CD-ROM. My rMBP doesn't have a DVD drive. Is it possible to get this online instead?,?,"According to Parallels manual on page 13 (http://www.parallels.com/fileadmin/parallels/documents/support/pd8fm/Parallels_Desktop_User_s_Guide.pdf): Note: If your Mac doesn't have a DVD-ROM, you can use the download link, available in the retail box, to download Parallels Desktop over the Internet. Hope this helps :) Good luck!"
6861,open-ended,B008YTAKJA,Must I also install Windows on my Mac? Before or After I instal Parallels?,,"If you intend to run Windows on a MAC, you must first install Parallels and then install Windows onto Parallels. You can then run Windows and Windows programs on a MAC."
6862,open-ended,B008YTAGGW,"I know this was made for PS3/Wii/Xbox360/PC and I assume it will also work on next-gen, or should I wait because Roxio will release a next gen one?",,it works really good with my xbox one about the ps4 I'm not sure I just have the xbox one

6864,yes/no,B008YTAGGW,does it work on mac?,Y,"Yes, we have found it works on Mac. What doesn't work on a Mac?"
6865,open-ended,B008YTAGGW,Does this come with the cords to hook up to my xbox? If not what cords do I need to get?,,"No, the only cord that comes with the device in the box is the USB cable, which connects from the device to your PC. Whichever version of the Xbox 360 you have, you'll need at least one HDMI cable to go from the device's output into your TV. If you have an original Xbox 360 that doesn't support HDMI, you'll need an Xbox 360 Component cable to plug straight from your console into the device's component input. If you have an original Xbox 360 with HDMI support, or an Xbox 360 version S (""slim"") or E (""super slim""), you'll need another HDMI cable to go out from the console and into the device."
6866,yes/no,B008YTAGGW,"If you are playing a video game on line, can this device capture and record the video and audio from computer?",?,If on a console yes easily. If your talking computer game it becomes complicated. Use the free Open Broadcasting Software for PC recording. Product is bad DO NOT BUY
6867,yes/no,B008YTAGGW,can you use this to capture from a HDMI dvd player?,Y,Yes you can

6871,open-ended,B008YTAGGW,can I run this on a windows 7 or 8 laptop? And can I stream and make videos on xbox 360 for laptop ?,,"Yes it will work, it does have live-streaming capability (although there's some setup involved) and records 360 quite well. I run a laptop as well and as long as it's multi-core and quick, it'll get the job done."
6872,open-ended,B009066SM4,What version is this software? 2013?,,Version 11.8 (2011). This is a terrific program and worth every cent. It reminds me of the AutoCAD LT series of the early 2000's.
6873,open-ended,B009066SM4,What is the difference between the academic and non versions?,,I don't know
6874,yes/no,B009066SM4,do I need student ID to to activate this product?,?,I did not need a student ID when I activated my academic version.

6878,open-ended,B00907I8GC,Where do I find the product key to activate from the trial version?,,"When I purchased it, Amazon sent a receipt and it included the product key. As for a trial version, I am not sure there's even a product key - only for purchases"
6879,yes/no,B00907I8GC,I purchased the 360 Premier last year &amp; downloaded it onto 3 seperate PC's &amp; it's about to expire. Is it possible to renew it on all 3 devices?,?,If you renew you may get charged full amount from Norton. Just buy it again from Amazon download and reinstall on your computers
6880,yes/no,B00907I8GC,does it work with windows 8.1?,?,Works well with Windows 8... We haven't done the 8.1 upgrade yet. Heard there were some issues with it.

6882,open-ended,B00907I8GC,i bought the norton in april and i put it in 1 computer ii want to put it in another coumpter.,,"You can add Norton 360 to up too 3 computers in total. or you can add it to your cell phone too, i believe, good luck great product!!"
6883,open-ended,B00907I8GC,"Want Norton 360 but am in Colombia, South America?",,"There should be no problem at all about your home country for the software. Only problem you may encounter is the mailing of the box if you order the physical package instead of downloading it. However I will warn you, the Amazon downloading service does not work properly with Windows 8 so if you do download it and it does not install properly don't even waste time playing with it. Just download the software from the Norton website and after installation enter the product code provided from Amazon after purchase."
6884,yes/no,B00907I8GC,I already have 360 2013 Premier and only need the code to renew. Do I still need to install the product again?,N,I would think you only need to upgrade on input the new code but I cannot say for sure since I did not upgrade from a former version of 360.
6885,yes/no,B00919RL9E,Does PM Platinum allow creating and printing quarter page greeting cards?,Y,Yes. Other size options are available as well.
6886,open-ended,B00919RL9E,"Do you download it to your computer, or do you have to put the disk in everytime?",,"If you purchase the disk, there is an install feature that lets you take two paths: 1. Download everything, including the graphics. You will not need the disk again, but uses more storage space on computer. 2. Download program only. To use their graphics, disk will need to be inserted ."
6887,yes/no,B00919RL9E,I have Mac OSX 10. 6.8.. is this compatible? Only buying this for the label possibility..,?,"I found it to NOT be compatible with my Mac OSX. It did enough strange things that I have not been able to use it for the purpose I really wanted it for. I was trying to make label for the canned goods I made last year. I installed it and uninstalled it and tried it again and it still did not do the job. My main problem was the few backround designs would not come out anywhere near correct on the label. Sometimes the whole label scrambled. I really wanted something other than just plain text. I hope some day to find a program that does work with my Mac as I use to love to design things with my Print Shop on my old PC. I've thought about buying a more expensive program, but won't do it until I know it will work well."
6888,open-ended,B00919RL9E,Does printmaster platinum have an FTP program built in? Will it prepare a disk ready for FTP transfer?,,yes
6889,yes/no,B00919RL9E,does it have the option to use it in spanish?,?,"I actually don't remember choosing a language, so I don't think there are any options. It's in English."
6890,yes/no,B00919RL9E,Can I draw lines freehand on PrintMaster Platinum 2011?,N,"No. You can draw Shapes and Lines (arrows, single lines, triangles, squares, etc.), but you cannot draw freehand."
6891,open-ended,B00919RL9E,PM Platinum project not save to gallery. My wife has a lot of projects in her gallery and now when she creates a new one it will only save to disk.,,I don't see a question to answer-Ellie
6892,open-ended,B00919RL9E,PM Platinum project not save to gallery,,"I believe that when you save you also need to save a copy in another format. When you click save there should be a drop down choice to save in either word 97, just, or pdf. You should then be able to drag into I photo. . I hope I have understood your question&#9786;"
6893,open-ended,B00919RL9E,"im trying to print a banner. it only prints the center page. i found in the manual ""span multiple pages"" but nothing says WHERE this is located. any one know ?",,check what your printer is on. The printer can usually work it for you. Brenda
6894,yes/no,B00919RL9E,can i mailing labals,Y,Yes! You have the option to create from ready-made template or create from scratch
6895,open-ended,B0092UELR2,Compatible with OS X 10.6?,,Some Mac users experience difficulties installing the Open Office 4.0 on the OS X 10.6 platform. You should first upgrade your system to Mavericks or the latest Yosemite OS X 10.10 before installing the Apache Open Office 4.0.
6896,yes/no,B0092UELR2,I am running Mavericks on my iMac. Is this compatible?,?,"Yes I upgraded to Maverick 10.9 and use Apache all the time with no problems. Easy to convert to other formats if you need to share with people that are using a different platform. I would recommend this for a low end user that needs word processing and spreadsheets without having to pay a fortune for office etc. Of course, there is a learning curve but not much. Acts like and has similar features of excel and word. Hope this helps"
6897,yes/no,B0092UELR2,Does this have OCR software allowing the use to bring in a PDF file and text edit it?,N,I dont think so!...At least not for me!
6898,yes/no,B0092UELR2,can word and excel documents be read with open office,Y,yes and it works fairly well. Word and Excel can also read open office spreadsheets and docs.
6899,yes/no,B0092UELR2,Is it possible to download only the features I need and skip pieces like the mathematical equation editor?,N,No. It's all or nothing.
6900,open-ended,B0092UELR2,Can I use on an IPAD? Is there a powerpoint portion?,,No!
6901,yes/no,B0092UELR2,"I have Yosemite OS X 10.10.3 Dowloaded, can't open because I didn't get it at app store. Is there a way around this?",?,"Go into system preferences, look under you security settings to approve the download."
6902,open-ended,B0092UELR2,"can you transfer word documents to it? if so, will it automatically change the format?",,It read my Microsoft word and excel documents without conversion. If you make changes it can write it in its ODT format. Great software
6903,yes/no,B0092UELR2,are files capatible with MS Office for PC,Y,I run on Mac. It has been compatible with all of my MS Office for Mac files. I would be willing to step out and say it should work well for the PC version as well.
6904,open-ended,B0092UELR2,I have to go back to Amazon &amp; re-download the program often. How do I make it permanent?,,Never had that problem. Sorry can't help. I downloaded once and then I upgraded to the latest release at that time.
6905,open-ended,B009348X7Q,There seem to be alot of negative reviews. Any word on a 4.0 version?,,"I've only got what they sent me but some of the problems might be solvable with a few more expert programmers, sure, but many of them are structural. There is just so much you are going to be able to do with the technology because of the nature of the problem it tries to solve. I'm sure they will eventually produce another version and probably in several different editions, but I don't see the next version of a software that's been around for more than a decade suddenly making a quantum-leap in performance. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. Hope this was helpful."
6906,yes/no,B009348X7Q,Will this work on a MacBook Air?,Y,"Yes, but it's best to have at least 4GB of memory. In any case, it simply doesn't work well with OS X on any iteration of the Mac, and I couldn't recommend it for the Apple environment."
6907,yes/no,B009348X7Q,does this version have DVD rom for installation?,?,My version came on a DVD. I think there also may be a downloadable version as well.
6908,yes/no,B009348X7Q,"Does Dragon Dictate 3.0 favor one headset over another, if so what is the best head set?",Y,"My experience dictates : ) success when using Plantronics DSP-V3. I have used two others with varying success however it may also depend on your voice, diction, inflection, accent, and training the program to understand YOU. Quite honestly I find the Apple voice recognition software included with Mountain Lion and I presume Mavericks to work equally as well as Dragon Dictate. Apple provides far superior customer service. Dragon virtually none! Save a couple hundred bucks with less frustration."
6909,yes/no,B009348X7Q,Is the Head set included with the shipped order as it is from the nuance site?,Y,Yes
6910,yes/no,B009348X7Q,Is version 3.04 compatible with Mavericks?,Y,"Yes, after installing it you have to get the upgrade from Nuance available only on-line for free. It doesn't work until you do."
6911,open-ended,B009348X7Q,"my Dad has a strong Croatian accent &amp; i would like to get speech to text software for his ""autobiography"" which will have lots of foreign (foreign slang too) and English words mixed. I have little $, so I would like to know the cheapest software...",,"Dragon Dictate trains to your voice. So, it should be able learn to recognize your father's voice. Also, you can add words (English or otherwise) to its dictionary. I don't know how it will handle foreign words."
6912,yes/no,B009348X7Q,"Do people here know ""dictation and speech"" software may be on their Mac? I just realized this two days ago, and I've had this Mac for 18 months!!!",?,"Dictation software is available on the Mac. Although I haven't looked at it in a while and it may have changed with the last update, the Mac dictation is far more limited and is more appropriate for a sentence or two or quick commands. Unless it has radically changed, it is not as accurate as Dragon, once you have set up and implemented Dragon. It is good for a quick sentence here or there but isn't yet set up for dictating long text documents the way that Dragon is. I agree it would be much better to have all this at your fingertips within the OS itself (and I'd even be willing to pay for an add on). Dragon definitely could use some competition in this market and Apple clearly has the ability to do this, as does Google. Sadly, neither company has released anything that can compete directly with Dragon. Dragon's software definitely works, but whether you are using it in Windows or OS X, it is definitely quirky and never completely integrates with the host OS. Having the most mature and viable product and pretty much the ONLY product for individual use, has allowed Dragon to charge higher prices, give so-so customer support to retail consumers, and continue to put a product that never quite meshes completely with the host OS (although it remains highly useful and is gobs faster than typing). It is only a matter of time, though, and this is a field where some healthy competition would be a good thing."
6913,open-ended,B009348X7Q,All these reviews are from 2012. Anything more recent?,,I haven't reviewed Dragon Dictate but I absolutely LOVE it. It's increased my content production ability 3-fold... Works great out of the box though I do recommend you go through the tutorials so that it works even better. I highly recommend.
6914,yes/no,B009348X7Q,Does it recognises Spanish language?,N,"No. It does not recognize Spanish. It only recognizes English. The windows version sold by Nuance is called Dragon Naturally Speaking and that one does recognize Spanish with the correct language pack. It is also a much better program. For people with a mac, the only solution would be to infall windows with VMWare Fusion or Parallels, and then Dragon Naturally Speaking. That would give you Spanish language recognition for dictation in a mac. Of course, this is not the most practical approach, but so far the only approach I am aware of that works."
6915,yes/no,B0093CBTOM,"So, if I were to install Ms Office on my server, would these licenses allow me to access that software on a client?",N,No. These are client access licenses for server 2012 only. These are not remote access licenses. Those are separate. Also you would need separate licenses for office as well.
6916,open-ended,B0093CBTOM,"So, how can I 'install' or 'activate' this 5 user CAL on a 2012 Server I already have up and running? I dont know how this key associats w a machine",,I dont think it matters from a technological point. I have always purchased the CALS that I need and keep the proof of purchase. I have never done anything with the CALS. I have never had trouble connecting computers to a domain. It is very much on your honor as far as I know. If you find out otherwise I would love to hear.
6917,open-ended,B0093CBTOM,Can the CALs be used on Windows Server R2 2012 Standard? Or is if only used for Windows Server 2012 Standard?,,Yes. The Windows Server 2012 License Pack is for 2012 and 2012 R2.
6918,open-ended,B0093CBTOM,"Can I split the CALs over two servers? That is, two 2012 VMs (same host) and use two CALs for the first VM and three for the second?",,"As long as your server(s) are configured in the ""per user"" fasion as opposed to ""per device"" you likely wont even get bothered about anything.. you don't really have to put any key codes into the server at all. Really, it seems having them is so you are still legal with everything and stay within the terms of service with Microsoft. Safe from an audit this way for example."
6919,yes/no,B0093CBTOM,Can I use this on five computers on my network?,Y,It is my understanding that five computers can log into the server that has these licenses installed. You can't install server 2012 five times.
6920,yes/no,B0093CBTOM,"If I install CALS on one computer system, then the computer crashes, can I install the same CAL software on another computer system?",?,"Yes, as long as they are only used to license one windows server instance at a time. Also, CAL's arent enforced, so its up to the user to ensure that they have enough."
6921,open-ended,B0093CBTOM,We have AWS instance with Windows 2012R2 and want more than two concurrent remote access sessions. What do I buy? This?,,Correct. This will give you multiple remote users simultaneous access to your 2012R2 server.
6922,yes/no,B0093CBTOM,"If I'm just using a copy of 2012 server to study, will I need these keys? I have 2 Win 8 Pro machines on the same network, and a few devices.",?,"With only two PCs to log into the Server you won't need them. Also this particular License Pack is only useable if YOU are building the Windows 2012 server. They are not keys you can add after the initial build (eg they can't be used with a server you are buying from Dell, HP, etc.)"
6923,yes/no,B0093CB30M,Does 2012 have 32 bit option,N,No - Only 64bit.
6924,yes/no,B0093CB30M,Can I use this license on a evaluation version that I installed from Microsoft as well as in a VM environment?,Y,Yes
6925,open-ended,B0093CB30M,hi is this a download after purchase or shipped?,,shipped
6926,yes/no,B0093CB30M,I plan to use this as a MySQL server. Do I need a CAL to RDC to this for maintenance?,?,"Not in my experience, though I'm running my copy as a VM so I just log on directly."
6927,yes/no,B0093CB30M,Can this license be used to activate an instance of Windows Server 2012 Standard whose evaluation period has expired?,?,"Yes, as long as you do not need to go to the R2 version upgrade."
6928,yes/no,B0093CB30M,Can we install this licence has a new installation not an upgrade.... why is it saying in System Requirements (Platform: Windows Server 2011),Y,"Yes. This license cannot be installed as an upgrade, it must be a fresh install."
6929,open-ended,B0093CB30M,2012 server essentials: when is 2012 server essentials going to be released?,,http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/windows-server/buy.aspx is where you can get your license and download the media for installation.
6930,yes/no,B0093CB30M,My business is getting software that requires Windows Server 2012. Will this OS install on a Dell XPS X8700 to run as a server for our software? Thx,?,I installed Windows Server 2012 Standard on a Dell PowerEdge T110 II server and it runs great! I do not know about installing it on a Dell XPS X8700 though. What hardware requirements does your business software specify? I hope that this helps. Please feel free to send another email at mars10@comcast.net if you have any more questions. My name is Marshall.
6931,yes/no,B0093CB30M,Does 2012 have 32 bit option,N,No - Only 64bit.

My name is Marshall.
6939,yes/no,B0093FRO7A,Can I download software to more than one of my computers?,Y,"Generally, Adobe allows installation of its products on a primary computer and a laptop, with the provision that the secondary computer (laptop) is not used simultaneously, and the two installations must be used by the same person. This is cut and paste from Photoshop Elements 11 license agreement: ""2.1.3 Portable or Home Computer Use. Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.1.4, the primary user of the Computer on which the Software is installed under Section 2.1 (""Primary User"") may install a second copy of the Software for his or her exclusive use on either a portable Computer or a Computer located at his or her home, provided that the Software on the portable or home Computer is not used at the same time as the Software on the primary Computer."" If you use a Mac that dual boots to Windows, you have to have 2 licenses; the second installation is not authorized as it is on the same OS system."
6940,yes/no,B0093FRO7A,I just boght a windows 8 laptop. Will this download work on Windows 8?,Y,Yes. Elements 11 works with Windows 8.
6941,yes/no,B0093FRO7A,is this a dvd?,Y,"You can buy it as a ""download"" or the boxed set with DVDs. I prefer the boxed set. What you are really buying is a serial number and licence to use it on two personal computers."
6942,yes/no,B0093FRO7A,Do I need photoshop and Premire?,?,Photoshop elements is for working with and editing photos and Premier elements is for working with and editing video.
6943,open-ended,B0093FRO7A,What if I upgrade to windows 8? Will Elements and Premiere 11 still work?,,"I use Windows 7. According to what I've read on the Premier Elements forum and the specifications at Adobe, it will work with Windows 8. See: http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements/tech-specs.html Bill"
6944,yes/no,B0093FRO7A,Can I customer size photos for printing?,Y,Yes.
6945,yes/no,B0093FRO7A,will photos &amp; movies from 7d work?,Y,Yes.. Best practice will be to download the still images into Organizer and then Edit in Elements - Organizer is included with Elements.
6946,yes/no,B0093FRO7A,Do you have to install both programs .... Just wondering,N,"No, they are separate"
6947,yes/no,B0093FRO7A,Does this version offer the oil painting special effect?,?,"I don't think it has that name exactly but it has a lot of settings and in those settings you can change them also. I really like it, I only do it for home use and I am happy with it. The photo merge is very sweet, I have four kids and trying to get them all to smile is hard, lol. Also you can remove people or other objects which is great also."
6948,open-ended,B0093FRO7A,How do I transfer all my photos from an older version to Photoshop Elements 11?,,You'll want to use the Backup and Restore functions in the Organizer -- http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/kb/backup-restore-move-catalog-photoshop.html
6949,yes/no,B0093FROFM,Does this software allow you to insert pictures into video clips (like an overlay rather than interrupting the video)?,Y,"Yes, you should be able to do that. You work in layers in Adobe Premiere Elements (like Photoshop), so you'd have the video on one layer and the picture(s) on a second layer."
6950,yes/no,B0093FROFM,is premiere elements compatible with windows 8.1 operating system?,Y,Yes. I have been using Adobe Premiere Elements 11 with Windows 8 initially then with Windows 8.1.
6951,open-ended,B0093FROFM,Why doesn't the serial number work??? Message says it's not valid?,,I'll just repeat what you've probably already done but I don't have anything else as I don't recall having a trouble entering the SN. I'm short handing: Upper/Lower case correct; using actually SN not product ID etc; 1 for I; Num lock on/off; not a counterfeit version. All I can think of hope it helped. Sam
6952,yes/no,B0093FROFM,"I took some pictures with my DSLR, when I uploaded the photos to my laptop some of the files were CR2. will elements 11 open these so I can save them",N,"""CR2"" stands for Canon Raw photos which means that the internal processor was not used to manipulate the image. Adobe Premiere Elements 11 does support import of CR2 formatted images. One caution, DSLR images, jpeg or cr2, all have large file sizes which Elements 11 can not handle efficiently; you need to reduce the file size of your images to about 3 Mb or less before importing them to ensure smooth operation of the software; you can reduce the file size using Adobe Photoshop software which is intended for modifying still images. G. L. D."
6953,yes/no,B0093FROFM,"Does Premiere Elements 11 run on Win 7 64 bit without any hassles? A recent comparison between versions 11, 12, &amp; 13 mentioned some if's and but's.",?,"Unfortunately I'm running Windows 8, 64 where I have Elements installed and works fine. I have Windows 7 32 at home but haven't installed Elements there. Good luck. Sam"
6954,yes/no,B0093FROFM,Can photoshop elements 11 open NEF files from a Nikon camera?,N,"I don't know the specifics of Nikon's NEF RAW image format but Elements 11 does open my Canon SLR RAW images so would guess that Elements also opens all Nikon formats. However, Elements can NOT handle the large size of RAW images, so don't use it unless you first down rez all your RAW images before importing into Elements which is stable for small and medium size still and video images file sizes."
6955,yes/no,B0093FROFM,"Is this a good, affordable tool for making YouTube videos? Nothing crazy but I want to be able to do things like picture-in-picture, green screen etc",Y,"After some initial difficulty with the program freezing up, it settled down and has been great for making videos for Youtube. I've used it for green screen and it works great."
6956,yes/no,B0093FROFM,"Does the ""old version"" relate to the fact that there is now a an Adobe Premiere Elements 12 out?",N,"The answer is ""yes."" However, Adobe Premiere 11 comes with a disc in a box with instructions; purchase of Premiere 12 requires a fee-based Adobe account which lets you download the software from their cloud servers so you don't have a disc. I have not tried 12 for any user interface changes."
6957,open-ended,B0093FROFM,In Premier Elements 11 can you expand all audio tracks to display the waveforms?,,I think that you can. I haven't worked alot with this photo shop but it has alot in it.
6958,open-ended,B0093FROFM,Does this software come as an install CD or DVD? 1-2 hour downloads from the internet are TEDIOUS at best. I need to hold an install disc in my hands.,,"It came as a physical, hold-in-your-hand CD. Installation was not a problem."
6959,yes/no,B0093FROMA,Amazon never identifies whether the software is an upgrade or a full version. Even customer service didn't know. Can anyone answer this? Thanks.,?,This is the full version.
6960,open-ended,B0093FROMA,Download vs. hardcopy version?,,"I got the hard copy because if something happens to your hard drive, you have something to reload it with. Also, you can load it on more than 1 computer which I did. In addition, the hard copy comes with a DVD that has lessons on all facets of the program if you want help. Also a certificate comes with it for $20 of services from Shutterfly. I just thought that it was a better deal for the same price. Hope this helps."
6961,open-ended,B0093FROMA,how many computers can I install this on,,Two computers only!
6962,open-ended,B0093FROMA,Well this run on Windows 8?,,Yes: http://blogs.adobe.com/photoshopdotcom/2012/10/windows-8-and-photoshop.html
6963,yes/no,B0093FROMA,Will my elements 5 run on windows 7?,?,"I have element 4 and it will open in windows 7. However, it does not perform all the tasks that it did within an older version of windows. Windows 7 reported that my element 4 had known compatibility issues whenever I opened it. I suspect that you might find that some tasks in windows 5 will likewise be limited or non-functional and that it is not fully compatible as well. If you already have the program, I suggest going to Adobe's support page and look for an update for element 5 that is compatible with your windows 7. Good luck."
6964,yes/no,B0093FROMA,I'm using PSE 10 and want to upgrade to PSE 11. Does the CD version box include an upgrade rebate?,?,"My box did not have a rebate coupon. Adobe now uses upgrade editions, requiring you to have the older license. The upgrade edition seems to be priced at ten dollars less than the price for the full edition and I don't see the upgrade edition listed YET on Amazon for sale and download. Perhaps it is coming in future. I suggest you write or call Customer Service and inquire."
6965,yes/no,B0093FROMA,I recently bought a DSLR camera and I want to start editing my photos and also do some digital scrapbooking. Is Photoshop Elements 11 useful for that?,Y,"Yes! This is great software! Very easy to use, yet very professional."
6966,open-ended,B0093FROMA,number of computers it can be installed upon?,,I have two computers and have installed it on both with no problems
6967,open-ended,B0093FROMA,"You can upload RAW images, right? Dumb question?",,"Yes, raw images open directly in camera raw automatically. You can also choose to open JPEG in raw as an option, although you won't have access to as many functions."
6968,yes/no,B0093FROMA,Will it work with Olympus Camere Raw (OCR)?,Y,"Yes, use every day with OCR files."
6969,yes/no,B0093H8W4W,Will the Pro Pack work with the 64 Bit version of Windows 8?,Y,I have loaded it up on my system with 64-bit Windows 8 Pro and it works perfectly.
6970,open-ended,B0093H8W4W,"So, why is media center and remote desktop an extra function? Did it change or just removed from basic?",,"I believe that Microsoft pulled out those functions from the basic program because they had intended on charging for them. I heard that Media Center would cost an extra $29, then it went to $19, and for the last couple of months, Microsoft gave it away for free. The functionality is the same. I think this was just a way to get a bit more money from the application by selling popular add-ins."

6972,open-ended,B0093H8W4W,Is it possible to do a clean install with Pro Pack and does anyone have personal experience doing it?,,"The Pro Pack is an Upgrade product. If you received a Lap Top as I did with Windows 8 Standard You can upgrade it to Pro with the Pro Pack. In terms of a fresh install if you had a licensed version of Windows 8 on your computer you have the right to ask the manufacture for the Windows 8 Install CD to reinstall Windows 8, (say over a version that has become corrupted ). After your fresh Win 8 Standard Install, (The manufacture of said computer usually has an agreement with Microsoft as the case with DELL where you don't even input codes.. though it will register as soon as internet is connected) then you can install ProPack 8 for a virtually clean install."
6973,yes/no,B0093H8W4W,"In case of re-installing pre-installed Windows 8, can you apply Pro Pack code again?",?,"Go to Microsoft or you computer support group as I have yet to reinstall 8 ,and all of my desktops are oem install on PC's built by me !

6979,yes/no,B0093N1JJG,Will it run on a Mac OSX computer?,Y,"Yes, you should send their support an email and ask for the free trial version... I see ""support@math-support.com"" as the correct email.

6983,open-ended,B0094KBQL4,"Can this be downloaded from here or is it hard-copy only? My mac doesn't have a disc drive, so I couldn't use the CD installer.",,"The CS6 software is a boxed version with discs. However, you may download the ""trial version"" from Adobe's website, and then use the serial number included with the box to ""activate"" the downloaded install into a fully-licensed version. In that case, you may wish to simply purchase the electronic version of CS6, available direct from Safe Harbor Computers. Thank you Jeff"
6984,open-ended,B0094KBQL4,What is the difference with Adobe CS6 Master Collection [LEGACY VERSION] ??,,"Adobe has moved to a subscription model- you pay a certain amount every month and you have access to the newest version of their Creative Suite. CS6 was the last to be released on a disc. Personally, I wanted a disc so I would own the program and not have to pay a monthly fee, so I got CS6- works for me. I just didn't want to have projects that I cannot open because I did not pay a subscription that month. The life of a freelancer is variable and some months are good and some are slow- I wouldn't want to be in a position where I am in a slow month and am offered work I can't do because I can't afford the monthly fee. It isn't a lot but- kind of the principle of the thing. If I have a file on my computer- art I have created- I want to be able to have a functional program that will open it up. Otherwise it feels like my art is held hostage. So, it is called Legacy because it is not the newest version which is not on disc."
6985,open-ended,B0094KBQL4,What's the complete list of software included?,,"Anything and everything Adobe. ""Master"" collection"
6986,open-ended,B0094KBQL4,What's the complete list of software included?,,"Hi: It has Photoshop CS6, IDesign CS6, Illustrator C6, Powerpoint, Dreamweaver, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Flash and a bunch of other Adobe products that I don't really use. But it's totally legit and worked perfectly when I installed it on my MAC. You can email the seller directly - very easy to work with and will clear up any questions you have. The only thing you cannot do is register it as the # of registrations have been maxed. I didn't care about that. I just didn't want to have to buy that rip-off monthly subscription from Adobe. PS Mine is not on a disk, it's on a tiny flash drive."
6987,yes/no,B0094KBQL4,"Is it possible to install some contents of the software, like say i want to install only acrobat pro alone",Y,"Yes, you will get a menu when you run the installer that will let you choose which applications to install."
6988,yes/no,B0094KBQL4,Is this compatible with Mountain Lion and Maverick?,?,It works with Mountain Lion just fine. I have chosen to not upgrade to Maverick yet as I've read too many horror stories of stuff no longer working once it was installed. I'll wait till the dust settles and the bugs are worked out.
6989,open-ended,B0094KBQL4,"I noticed an unanswered question as to why the price is so low, as someone who is interested in purchasing this product I'd like to know this as well?",,"I can't answer for the other sellers, but seeing as how my price is the lowest on the list, I will say it's because the version we are selling of this software is Student/Teacher. Which just means that you need to be a student or teacher to activate it, but it's exactly the same as the others, just offered at a lower price for education. 100% genuine and brand new."

That cd should come with a windows key. However if you buy a computer with windows preinstalled you will not see the coa sticker anymore. The keys are now imbedded in the bios.
6994,open-ended,B0094NY3R0,Hardware locked or not? Is this System Builder license locked to a single PC (i.e. motherboard) or can be activated on another PC configuration after upgrade?,,"Windows 8 can be transferred to new hardware; it just needs to be re-activated. Here's my recent experience... I did a clean install of Windows 8 64-bit System Builder on a dated computer. Everything worked great- I was happy. I then successfully activated Windows 8. About a month later I decided that I wanted to build an almost entirely new system. I bought a new mainboard, processor & memory combination. I then took my original hard drive with Windows 8 already installed & activated on it, and I connected it to the newer components I assembled. Everything worked great- I was happy. Except Windows 8 needed to be re-activated. I tried re-activating by Internet and was instructed onscreen to activate by phone instead. I called the phone number displayed and was immediately connected to an automated telephone system. The automated voice asked me to read aloud 5 or 6 sets of numbers which were on my screen, or I could use the phone keypad to enter in the same information. I elected to read the sets of numbers aloud, and Microsoft's automated system accepted this information without any problems. I believe it was at this time that the automated voice asked me how many computers I had installed this on. I said ""one"" and the automated system affirmed that answer. The system then said it would give me 5 or 6 sets of brand new numbers which I would need to type into my system. This is all done on the same screen within Windows 8 on which I had originally tried to re-activate. The automated voice stated the numbers clearly and I typed them into their respective entries onscreen. The voice then affirmed that Windows 8 was now activated. That's it! In this situation, I didn't need to speak with an actual person, but some situations may require speaking directly to a Microsoft Customer Service Rep. I'm not certain how many times this procedure can be easily repeated. I'm thinking about switching to a solid state drive in the near future. I'm guessing I might need to re-activate Windows 8 again when I do. I hope this helps!"
6995,yes/no,B0094NY3R0,Is there a way to uninstall Windows H8 and install XP?,Y,"Yes, but you are better off with Windows 7, if your computer is new enough. Find tutorials on Youtube."
6996,yes/no,B0094NY3R0,"On Windows 8, can you disable the metro UI and make it look like windows 7?",Y,"Yes, you can download the ""start8"" software from Stardock. But that would be dumb, just learn how to use Metro. YES. is ugly at first, but really after 2 hours is just amazing. You will forget about windows 7!"
6997,yes/no,B0094NY3R0,Would I need to purchase another product with this? I believe that as an OEM version it has to come with something else I think.,?,"Well you do need a clean hard drive and computer that is put together to install it! :) I just purchased this, and installed it on my computer that I freshly built with a hard drive that was completely empty. You don't need anything additional except a computer. I would not suggest buying this system, though. Better off going with Windows 7. I've been trying to get rid of my version of this (it can be installed again on another computer) at: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Microsoft-Windows-8-OEM-64-bit-System-Builder-/171125918826?pt=US_Operating_Systems_Software&hash=item27d7e64c6a"

You need to delete the system reserved partition by removing the system partition at the beginning of the installation or going to advanced options, a command line, diskpart, select disk, select parttion, delete partition. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2476568"

You could take a look at this: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-activate-windows Activation carries very few real benefits. It's a nuisance to have an unactivated copy, but you can ignore the activation messages and still use the computer for now. Certain Microsoft products such as Microsoft Security Essentials might require an activated version of Windows before you can use them (at least this happened in 7). I don't know if not having it activated will cause you problems down the line, so I recommend getting that fixed as soon as possible. Try contacting the seller and let them know the key you got doesn't work."
7001,open-ended,B0094NY3R0,product key? not provided on sleeve.,,"There is a sticker on the blue sleeve, the key is located in the bottom left corner."

I know 8.1 came out as a free download.,,The old version is windows 8 or 8 with media pro both have available free downloads to upgrade to the new 8.1 or you will have to buy the windows 8.1 Full Install I beleive that it runs about 120 dollars at most retail stores ...Just as a side note you need to make sure that you have windows 7 or later before you purchase you cannot do the install from the other operating systems .Also a word to the wise although your system might meet all the requirements Microsoft didnt bother to tell everybody that their new windows isent compatible with some processor chips (example the dell dimmensions 8300 pentium 4) processor chip wont allow you to to switch to nk which it needs to run the system some processors wont work with this system make sure to check all your specs befor purchase

7007,open-ended,B0094NX8TE,What is an OEM license?,,OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer. These lisences are usually suitable if you are building a system from scratch and need to load the software and it OS into it.

7011,yes/no,B0094NXBZ0,"I have Win 8 (64-bit) already installed on my newly purchased computer. Can Win 8 (SBV) Pro, encrypt my files and drive?",N,No you need the cheaper 'upgrade' version because you are technically upgrading from win8 regular to pro.

7014,open-ended,B0094NXBZ0,why is this so expensive here when it's only been sellling for less than 70 bucks from microsoft...,,"The 70 buck version is upgrade only. Course, down the road when your system crashes and you have to reinstall I wonder if they expect you to dig up the original version, install it, then install the upgrade over it? Strange, but yeah, the $70 dollar version is for if you already have some other version installed, I think as early as XP will work fine."
7015,open-ended,B0094NXBZ0,Release day shipping? What gives?,,"The EULA for this has been available for a while now at http://personaluselicense.windows.com/en-US/default.aspx and it says the following in regards to ""Windows 8 Pro System Builder"", which is as far as this license page is concerned the same as the OEM version (indicated by the selection made in the upper right of the screen): ""Can I transfer the software to another computer or user? You may transfer the software to another computer that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software (together with the license) to a computer owned by someone else if a) you are the first licensed user of the software and b) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. To make that transfer, you must transfer the original media, the certificate of authenticity, the product key and the proof of purchase directly to that other person, without retaining any copies of the software. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Anytime you transfer the software to a new computer, you must remove the software from the prior computer. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between computers. You may transfer Get Genuine Windows software, Pro Pack or Media Center Pack software only together with the licensed computer."" So yes, you can transfer this license to a new computer. Yes, you can sell your copy as long as you provide all of the materials that came with it, including the proof of purchase. No, you cannot use it on more than one computer at a time. It seems quite straight forward to me."

Your product will be renewing for 3 years from the date you first installed it. If Trend Micro introduces significant changes in the software, they will let you know and they will give you a free update to the new version for the duration of your original subscription. It happened to me; I had a 2009 software version that I renew year after year just by introducing the activation code (but without installing the new software), and last summer I got a message asking me to upgrade to the 2012 version because significant changes were made in that version. I was given the link, just clicked on it and my software was upgraded automatically. The current subscription length was maintain, no changes."

7025,open-ended,B0095C08YM,"We have Trend, but my computer froze and I could not use it for several months. My new computer should be covered by our current policy but I got a message I don't have protection.

7030,yes/no,B0095C09G4,Does this have the password/log in auto fill feature,?,"Trend Micro does have a SecurePass feature that allows you to use one master password to access all of your accounts. I do not use the feature as I never want to have one password for shopping and banking and other things. In addition, many sites have revolving passwords or ones that expire. Kaspersky had a feature that secured your password entries, but I found on Apple that it blocked the field making that difficult to use."
7031,yes/no,B0095C09G4,can I use this to renew my trend,?,it will give you a new serial number to load but you can use the same account on trend. You will have to have the new one listed with the old one. But remember not to use the Auto Renew. A lot of people ended up paying full price.

7089,open-ended,B009716H7S,"Hi, will this allow me to take movie clips and overwrite the audio to music I have saved either in iTunes or Windows Media Player?",,Yes...and edit the audio as well
7090,yes/no,B009716H7S,Can you separate audio from video?,Y,"Hi Mike, I've never had a reason to do that so your question made me curious so I tried it out. Power Director has a series of ""tracks"" that it displays when you edit a video. The original video has both a video and audio track. There are additional tracks below those that allow you to add another video and audio track, add an effects trqck, etc etc. All of the tracks also have a small control at the head of the track that allows you to turn them on and off at will. So, I opened an unedited video and just clicked ""disable"" at the head of the origianl audio track and the audio is gone. Click in the disable audio track again and your video is back. Power Director keeps all of the original material (original video, audio) additonal audio or video, additional effects, etc active within a ""project"" so that you can go back later and tweak anything you'd like without having to start over. When you ""produce"" a video you edited, the produced video gives you only what you enabled and/or added and none of the elements that you didn't want. So, you can disable the original audio, and replace it with what you want (if in fact you want audio). The produced video will have what you replace the original audio with. However, your ""project"" is always intact should you want to go back and change something later. It took me a while to get used to Power Director, but I've come to like the way it works."
7091,open-ended,B009716H7S,What can I do to speed up burning and rendering time. It is taking over 12 hours to burn a 1Hr 10min DVD and it's at 86% finished?,,"Rendering video is a very CPU-intensive process and requires a pretty high-end computer, depending on the scale of the project. To lessen the rendering time, make sure you close out all other applications and processes on your computer (CTRL-ALT-DEL and tab over to ""Processes"" to find some background stuff that doesn't need to be running, like Java applets or Apple helpers). Leave your computer idle and do not attempt to use another program while video is rendering. You can also lower the file size of the video by decreasing its resolution. If none of the above make significant changes, you may just need a better computer."
7092,yes/no,B009716H7S,"will power director 11 ultimate work on windows 8? -thanks,",?,"No idea. I've only used it on win 7. There's really no reason it shouldn't work on win 8, but it isn't a touch-enabled app if you were wondering. You could try asking their online support people. They usually get around to answering you, although it may take a few days."
7093,open-ended,B009716H7S,I purchased Power Director 11 Ultimate from you I can not install on Win 8 CyberLink refuses to support me what say you?,,"I don't think Amazon monitors the customer questions. If you want a refund, I think you'll need to seek help from Amazon customer service, which is very painful in my experience. For what its worth, I'm running Power Director 11 on two Window 8 Pro 64-bit machines without issues."
7094,yes/no,B009716H7S,does it crash a lot?,?,I haven't had any issues yet.
7095,yes/no,B009716H7S,I have three computers. Can I install it on at least two of them without having to buy another package?,?,"I don't think so. You have to go online to register the software within 30 days. If you don't, it loses some or all of its functionality (I'm ashamed to say I haven't done so yet, even though it's been longer than that since I installed it). Anyway, I suspect that once you register it on one computer, you probably won't be able to do so again for another one. Hope this helps."
7096,open-ended,B009716UB6,What's in the box? Does a CD come with It so that you can reload the program if somethink happens?,,there are 1 cd and 3 serial numbers in the box. and It works fine. but you need to search how to use it. some of options are a little bit confusing.
7097,open-ended,B009716UB6,Im interested in purchasing the 3 licenses .. my question is -- is this life time software or is this 1 year subscription? thanks?,,Life time software
7098,open-ended,B009716UB6,Does it work on new laptops where the WIndows Product Key is buried in the bios? Will it clone from that new laptop's HDD to a smaller SDD?,,I have no idea but I am sure it will clone to a smaller drive. My machines are Windows 7.
7099,open-ended,B009716GWE,Will this work in a HP 32 byte tower? Will it upgrade from XP to Windows 7?,,"I think it will. Here are the minimun requirements: Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition, Professional (32 bit with Service Pack 3) Microsoft Windows Vista Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, Ultimate (32 bit and 64 bit) Microsoft Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate (32 bit and 64 bit) Microsoft Windows 8 (32 bit and 64 bit)"

7102,yes/no,B009716GWE,can you do narrative scene editing with this program?,?,"I am now upgraded to Version 12. I am not sure what you mean by ""narrative scene editing"" but you can do pretty much everything in terms of editing a video. Ideally would be to contact them directly. But again, it is a very powerful software."
7103,yes/no,B009716GWE,is it user friendly,?,"Terrible program, just didn't work on a windows 7 machine, not particularly user friendly. It was so bad I had to get adobe premier for video and is much much better."
7104,open-ended,B009716H00,What is the difference between the 11th and the 12th versions?,,"Hi Christina R, I am sorry but I do not know. I have had so much trouble getting version 11 to work that they would have had to pay me to take version 12. I had only had version 11 about a month when version 12 was offered at 100. I would not have given 0.01 for it. I still wouldn't. I still have not managed to produce an edited video either to a Blu Ray disk or to a ""produce"" file. (Cyberlink term) I am sorry I can't help you in this matter, but I wish you well with whatever video editing system you end up with. Nick."
7105,yes/no,B009716H00,Can i edit videos in full HD with it?,?,"Hi Paul, If you have got / or get Cyberlink ""Ultimate"" or the ""Ultra"" version of Power Director, they will deal with 4k video. According to the specifications on page 3 of the ""Cyberlink Power Director Users Guide"" that is resolution greater than 1920 x 1080. I can't verify that it works satisfactory as I have not tried it. My problem was getting 3d to work. It is only this week I have managed to cure the problems I had. It was caused by one tiny section on a hard drive having Fat 12. This did not show up as a partition on the hard drive so I never knew about it until I tried to completely reformat it using Partition Magic and it wouldn't do it. The point I am trying to make is that the more you ask of the program the more spot on the computer needs to be. The hard drive I had the problem with was only used for storing video, not for running the Windows operating system. I wish you luck in whatever route you decide to go with your video editing. Nick."
7106,open-ended,B009716H00,"Can I insert or open with a Photo, then using a Panning effect on the photo insert background music and narration?",,I dont know. Ive used this only to edit and fix current videos and i havent had alot of time to play with program and discover its full potential. Sorry that i cant help you more.
7107,yes/no,B009716H00,"Will this product (Power Director Ultimate Suite) record/capture on-screen video - i.e. webcam,external cam, powerpoint presentation, etc.",?,"Power Director is pretty much a straight forward video editing program, it can capture video from a web cam--but not from you monitor or powerpoint--if those features are important to you probably want to check out a media suite, like Roxio or Nero--but even with them your screen recording capabilities are probably limited. You'd be best off downloading a program that's designed specifically for screen capture."
7108,yes/no,B009716H00,Does this product include Media Espresso and Power Director Mobile? (These are both included as a bundle on the Cyberlink site),?,"I'm not sure, you're best bet is to email Cyberlink and ask them if the boxed version includes those."
7109,yes/no,B009716H00,Does this product include PhotoDirector 4?,N,"No it does not. To include PhotoDirector 4, you want Cyberlink Director Suite.. www.cyberlink.com/products/director-suite/features_en_US.html?&r=1"
7110,open-ended,B009716HMI,I'm looking for a program that will collect all of the photos on my computer and organize them by the meta data- will this program do that?,,"I think you can at some extend, like sort by ISO for example. You want to consult the manual for this to make sure it does what you are looking for. Also you can download the trial. And register to the forum might help, or call them."
7111,open-ended,B009716HMI,How do you edit a slideshow after it's produced?,,"You can't, once it produce a video its done no turning back. Your best option is to recreate your slide show. Another option: if you have PowerDirector from Cyberlink you can edit the video as a video & not slideshow - its complicated, I rather recreate the slideshow then."
7112,open-ended,B009716HMI,Does someone know: is it supports windows 7 x64-bit? The distorsions don't work on my computer.,,"Yes, it does. I have Win 7 in 64 bit mode and it works."

7115,open-ended,B009716HMI,"I imported all 20,000 JPG files set up in picasa into directories based on dates. Even though I said leave the files in the folders, I cannot see the folders only the drive that they are in. Also if I make a change picasa does not see it and visa...",,I don't use Picasa but I had no trouble transferring folders of pictures. Try dragging the folders to My Photos or relabeling them. Hope this helps.
7116,open-ended,B009716HMI,What is the difference between PhotoDirector 4 and PhotoDirector 4 Ultra?,,PhotoDirector 4 Ultra does not include ColorDirector. PhotoDirector 4 Suite 4 includes ColorDirector for $40 more. ColorDirector 4 Ultra is the individual product and priced at $129.

Is this software ok for a bright and interested 10 year old?,,"wow, 10-- kids are so computer savvy... my 16-year old is doing pretty advanced 3D animation, so I think that it's possible for a 10year old to learn this if he has patience and the attention span. Someone may have to help him here and there, but you know best if he's a kid that can learn things on his own. I do find that you can Google almost any question and someone somewhere has an answer, so that's helpful. Also, we love Lynda.com, which has tutorials for almost any software for unlimited learning at $35. a month. I don't remember if they have this software but you can go on their site and see. At the very least, if he finds it too hard, he can put it away for a year or two and try it again later-- but if he does well at this at age 10 he's doing great and has a future in this area if he wants it. I do have a background in design and know Adobe suite, so I find this fairly simple to learn but it is time consuming. Hope this is helpful. I will say that it is well worth the price."

Is it possible to upload an existing plan into the program?,?,"Looked through the packages index and contents. See no way to load existing plans. After working with the package for some period of time, I would be shocked if you could."
7138,yes/no,B0098EENIE,Can I download this to 2 computers?,?,"I don't think you can download it to two devices without paying twice. But I believe you can pay extra to get it on disk, and then install on more than one computer from the disk. I wish I had gotten the disk format, because I downloaded it and can now only use it on one computer."
7139,yes/no,B0098EENIE,"My 14 year old grand daughter wants a house design program that is easier than autocad to use, will this one work?",?,"I think it is definitely easier to use than Autocad, but it can be extensive, so she would need to play around with it for a bit. Also, there are a lot of tutorials for her to watch."
7140,yes/no,B0098EENIE,Can this be used with kindle fire tablet?,?,No. But you can export the diagrams as jpegs and show it to people on the tablet.

You can generate a materials list for a single room, an area plan for one floor or the whole plan. For more information, see Materials Lists."
7144,yes/no,B0098EENKM,Can this be used on a MAC,?,You would need to purchase the Designer Suite that is specifically for Mac. This one is for pc.
7145,open-ended,B0098EENKM,HOW MANY FLOORS CAN A DESIGN HAVE?,,"This is from the program help files: When a new plan file is opened in Home Designer Suite, two floors are present: Floor 1 and the Attic Floor.

7149,open-ended,B0098QMIE8,Which Act program will work with windows 8.1?,,Don't know. Pro 2013 works on 7.0. Definitely a question for the sales guys. Don't get premium if you don't need it.
7150,yes/no,B0098QMIE8,can I convert Act 3.0 to ACT!Pro2013,Y,"Yes, all act versions will convert over. There is a few steps involved with converting a database from that far back, but you are given 30 days of Complementary Support with Sage after activation for ''Getting Started'' Support which covers the converting an existing database to the new version."
7151,open-ended,B0098QMIE8,"My new laptop is running Windows 8,Office 365 and ACT Pro 2011. Any compatibility/conversion issues? Thx",,"The Pro 2011 version is not compatible. I upgraded to 8.1 with the new Office and it will not sync. ACT will also not support it. You will have to fork over another $300. The new version of ACT doesn't get any better, they just keep coming out with new versions so you have to spend more money ever couple years and you are stuck with it. After much discussion and complaints with ACT I have dumped it in favor of another contact management program. I'll never touch an ACT product again."
7152,yes/no,B0098QMIE8,"I want to build databases, enter notes, write letters using Word 2013. Will I need anything other than this program? I'm not liking these reviews.",?,"Sage Act! is good if you are already familiar with the program. Yes, it will do all those things and more. However, the reviews you're getting is accurate. The program has lots of bugs. And be prepared to be charged for technical support after the first 30 days, and they will try to sell you on this. I do not need any technical support because I have been using this for the past 20 years, and I'd like to say there is nothing better. However, I don't think this product is as good as the old Act 6.0. The other product I know is Top Producer, but you pay a monthly fee because it is internet based. I hope this does not scare you, but you need to be forewarned. This product is definitely not for the novice (due to bugs that it has) unless you are willing to pay their support fee for at least 1 year -- maybe, 2."
7153,yes/no,B0098QMIE8,Does this version work with Windows 8?,Y,"Yes, works fine. Been running it since spring."

7155,yes/no,B0098QMIE8,Can I install on 3 units; an office &amp; a home laptop plus notebook for travel for 1 license fee? Thanks. .,Y,"Nope. Separate license required for each. And if you have the latest version of windows, forget about. Look into a other product. We dropped Sage all togather because support is terrible and all they care about is upgrading you to another version for big bucks."
7156,open-ended,B0098QMIE8,Is this a full version or an upgrade,,full version
7157,yes/no,B0098QMIE8,I am reading about a cost per user per month to use this software. I do not recall that being true in the past. Is this mandatory to use the product?,?,"Sorry, but I am unable to answer that question"

7165,yes/no,B00991N4KO,Is it compatable with windows 7,Y,Yes. Office 2010 32 bit only
7166,yes/no,B0099D13LY,Will this work well with Win XP?,?,Bitdefender works very well with XP. I found that it is not as invasive as the other name brands (it does not take over your computer). It runs smooth in the background. Unfortunately I run some programs that act like a virus and kept shutting them down. This is not bad as that is what it is designed to do. I doubt that you or anyone would be using these programs as I built them myself. I would say it is the best of all security programs. I do not use any of these because of how I use my computer. If you shop around you can find this at a reasonable price.
7167,open-ended,B0099D13LY,Hey Guys does this product key work with 2014...thanks,,"yes it does bit buy something else unless you want system, network and popup problems. you will also be spammed with ads within 6 mos. of expiration."

7172,open-ended,B0099F82CK,"If I purchase this version (for $400+), how many workstations can I install it on? Or is this a single license?",,It is a single license.
7173,open-ended,B0099F82CK,How well does acrobat convert a PDF to Word?,,Pretty well - I've had some words misspelled throughout the document but easily corrected. It is better than retyping an entire document. Use the Microsoft Word spell check to catch all of the small issues.
7174,yes/no,B0099F82CK,Does the software include a spanish version?,?,"My Acrobat Pro is English only, but there is a Spanish version sold separately."
7175,open-ended,B0099F82CK,what is the duration of the license and how can i renew when this license is up?,,the license does not expire. You can probably upgrade it at some point in the future.
7176,open-ended,B0099F82CK,can this be used for two users or only one,,If you are paying less then full price you are more than likely going to receive a bogus copy. Mine was scratched and 50% off with no indication it was a bootleg. Good luck.

7180,open-ended,B0099F823E,"Is this price ""per seat""? per user? or per machine? or ?",,"Per machine. Actually, a bit more liberal than that. The Adobe retail license allows you to install it for the same user on two machines provided the two installation are not used concurrently. So if you are an individual you can install it on your desktop computer and laptop computer as long as you don't use them both at the same time, for example."
7181,yes/no,B0099F823E,Can I use this to add password protection to a pdf file?,Y,Yes. You can protect by creating a password required to open the pdf AND/OR to edit or print. There are separate options for certificate security (for groups of people signing and editing common files) as well as file encryption.
7182,open-ended,B0099F823E,are these discs or download?,,"If you order by selecting ""PC"", you will receive the discs.... If you order by selecting ""PC Download"", you will be able to download it to your PC."
7183,yes/no,B0099F823E,"Can you extract/insert pages from PDF reports with Acrobat XI? April 25, 2014 by Mike H.",Y,"Yes, you can. The problem is that these functions (like so many of them) are no longer available from the ""File-Edit-View"" menu at the top of the window. You've got to search through the ""Tool sets"" and add the function yourself to whatever tool set you choose. Royal PITA. I used to be able to do just about everything without taking my fingers off the keyboard. Now I find myself clicking with the mouse for almost every function I want to use. I wish Adobe hadn't so radically changed the way functions are accessed. Hmmm. Maybe in Acrobat XII?"
7184,yes/no,B0099F823E,Is this compatible with Windows 7 (32 bit) and Microsoft 2003?,Y,Yes
7185,yes/no,B0099F823E,Does this version contain PreFlight? I work with Magcloud a good bit and they require all PDF files to run through PreFlight before publication.,N,No you need Adobe Pro for the PreFlight function.
7186,yes/no,B0099F823E,is acrobat standard XI compatible with earlier versions?,Y,"As far as I can tell, it can read files created by any previous version. You'd have to enquire of someone else as to the compatibility with previous versions of the files Acrobat XI writes."
7187,yes/no,B0099F823E,I need to scan forms into the computer and make the fill in fields editable. Is this the software I need?,N,"I have not done this personally but check out, http://tv.adobe.com/watch/acrobat-x-tips-tricks/quick-tip-how-to-create-editable-form-fields/"
7188,yes/no,B0099F823E,Does this version allow you to add bookmarks to a document?,Y,"Yes, I don't use them much, but its very easy."
7189,yes/no,B0099F823E,Does this software crash when used on Windows 7 64 bit?,Y,I bought the Adobe Acrobat XI Standard program when I was running windows 7 Professional (64 bit) and never had an issue with it crashing. I also upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit) and the program continues to work flawlessly. I receive updates from Adobe automatically and the application always runs when I click on the icon and select any of the features I wish to use. I have a Dell Studio XPS 9100 desktop and have never had any problems with the Adobe Acrobat XI Standard software.

7191,open-ended,B009APQH76,"My initial installation was with a 3 pc license. Now at renewal time it, prompts me for $49 per installation! Is the multi device installation a promotion only? Anybody have any experience with this issue with Trend?",,To get the best price I have found that you need to buy the new version outright and not do it through a renewal. There seems to be no discount if renewed directly with Trend. Installation is just as easy as the first time. It will remove the old version and install the new one off the CD or download.
7192,yes/no,B009APQH76,Can I use this (5 devices) on 2 pc's and 3 laptops?,Y,"yes, any 5 devices"
7193,yes/no,B009APQH76,"This says 5 devices-so I assume it could just go on PC's alone, is this correct?",Y,"You can use on PC's, Mac's, I-phones, Androids phones, and Tablets. I have it on 2-n PC's, 2- Android phones, and my Galaxy Tablet. You can run any five at one time and even drop one and add another to your list you just can go over five at one time. The pkg. also comes with 20 gigs of free space on Trend Micro Safe-Sync cloud that you can access from anywhere."
7194,yes/no,B009APQH76,Do the 5 devices include cell phone and laptops? Thanks,Y,"Yes, an Android smartphone or tablet is counted as one."
7195,yes/no,B009APQH76,"Is it new in a box that was never opened? Is there a disk that comes with it, will it work on vista, and also windows 7 and windos 8. Thanks",Y,IT was new in a box with a cd. It runs on windows 8 and windows 7 with no problems. Been a use of Trend Micro for about 5 years.
7196,open-ended,B009APQH76,when you buy the 5 license verison how do you install them on your android phone and samsung tablet?,,"Once you install the program on your system (computer) a window will popup and ask if you want to install on your phone and tablet. Say ""get started"" with another device and it will ask you for your email address to send you a link to install on you phone and tablet. If you have closed that window, on the main screen/ dashboard screen at the very bottom in small letters it says ""protect another device"" click there follow the directions. Hope this helps."

Clarification?",,"For the 2013 version, Premium and Maximum are the same, with the following exceptions: Premium gives you a 5-user license, while Maximum gives a 3-user license. Premium provides 25BG Online Backup, while Maximum provides 5GB. Everything else is the same."

If you bought it directly from Trend Micro, you'll need to ask their CS about their policy."
7200,open-ended,B009APQBJA,Which one is better the antivirus or the internet security software and what is the difference?,,Hi Sherry... Internet Security is better than the Antivirus version... there's only one reason why and that is because the Internet Security version also has a firewall to protect you from hackers trying to get into your computer directly. The real purpose of the Antivirus version are for systems that are not connected to the internet 24 hours/day.
7201,yes/no,B009APQBJA,Does this come with cd,Y,Yes... otherwise it would be an empty box.
7202,open-ended,B009APQBJA,How many computers can this be used on at once?,,The single user license means you should use this on one computer.

7232,yes/no,B009CCVMUY,Does the Basic version of Turbo Tax allow you to print the federal return ?,?,"Yes, if you purchase the download or the retail package (which you can get from Amazon). Also, ""yes"" if you pay for the online version (which you cannot get from Amazon, you can get this from the TurboTax website). I believe the only case where the Basic version would not print the federal return is if you use the online version, and don't pay the 20 bucks when you want to file your return. I have used the Basic version of TurboTax since 1996. In my opinion, the only benefit to the Deluxe and Premier versions is that they provide you with more guidance for more complicated returns. If you generally know what you are doing (say, not much has changed from previous tax returns), the Basic version should suit your needs."
7233,yes/no,B009CCVMUY,is there an income limit on Turbo tax basic?,?,"I bought Turbo Tax Deluxe and on the back of the box it shows what features are included in both Basic and Deluxe. Basic is for those who do not itemize deductions, while Deluxe is for those that do itemize. It does not indicate that there is any income limit or parameters for either software. Hope that helps."
7234,yes/no,B009CCVMUY,can i do schedule bon form 1040?,Y,"Yes. Once a return is started, Turbo Tax Basic allows the user two options for entry: the interview method or the self-exploration method. Choosing the latter allows the user to push a ""forms method"" button to see actual forms, one of which is Schedule B. Once the form is in view it is easy to enter dividend and interest income directly."
7235,open-ended,B009CCVMUY,who can use turbotax basic?,,People who need it for personal taxes can use it. There is help for those with questions about their taxes but the financial advice part is less than with the deluxe version.
7236,open-ended,B009CCVMM2,"I'm a first time user, if I want to do my 2012 taxes do I want turbotax 2012 or turbotax 2013? Is it by the tax year or by the submit year?",,It's by tax year. So you want 2012 for 2012 taxes.
7237,open-ended,B009CCVMM2,Should I use TT Deluxe or Home/Business? I'm a contractor with a W-2 PT job on the side but don't own any investments or properties.,,"If you have a business that generates income and deductions, I would suggest, you should use Home/ Business."
7238,yes/no,B009CCVMM2,"Need to file 3 separate returns. Last yr, all were done using TT online. Will I be able to import data for all 3 returns using this software?",?,"Beware the additional costs if other family members live in different states. One state download is included, but each additional costs about $45, plus $19.99 to e-file the state return."
7239,yes/no,B009CCVMM2,can you do more than one return,?,"Yes, you can prepare and file as many returns as you wish. However, the IRS limits you to a maximum of 5 ELECTRONICALLY FILED returns. There is no limit to paper-filed returns. Bob Meighan VP, TurboTax"
7240,open-ended,B009CCVMM2,"How many returns can you prepare and e-file, federal and state, with TurboTax Home",,"You can file 5 Returns With This-That's the other reason of purchasing it. The step by step instructions along with the questions/suggestions cover just about every angle of savings. For me it's way cheaper than having them done for me and I reap the extra benefits. Plus you take your time doing them. There is no rush to finish that day you install the program. Everything, every step is saved easy to go back to."
7241,yes/no,B009CCVMM2,Can i use Turbo Tax home and business when my wife and i own a small business. It is an LLC. we are both equal owners and always file jointly.,?,"You will need to file forms with the IRS for the LLC (Form 1065, K-1s and any other applicable forms for your type of business). The home and business turbo tax does not include those forms. But the home and business turbo tax does allow you to include the income you earn from the LLC. If you want to use turbo tax for the 1065 and other forms you need to file with the IRS, there is another turbo tax product you would have to purchase for that - but I have never used it."
7242,yes/no,B009CCVMM2,is this the cd-rom version?,Y,yes
7243,yes/no,B009CCVMM2,Will this version work with windows 8 and outlook?,Y,We checked our program box and it states clearly that it works with Windows 7 and 8 so it should be OK.
7244,open-ended,B009CCVMM2,"I am a independent consultant, and I get a 1099-misc. I am pretty sure that I will have to do deductions, which turbo tax is right for me?",,Use Home and Business version. It's made specifically for your situation.
7245,yes/no,B009CCVMM2,Does this version allows you to do Individual income taxes and also small business? (I have a small candy buffet company),?,"Home and Business will work if you are a sole proprietor, consultant, 1099 contractor, or single-owner LLC. You will need to upgrade to Business version if you own an S Corp, partnership, C Corp, or multiple-owner LLC."
7246,yes/no,B009CCVMNQ,"If this does not work well on my netbook (which meets the minimum system requirements -- barely), can I transfer this to another machine?",?,I have not had any problem installing this program on multiple computers.
7247,yes/no,B009CCVMNQ,"If this does not work well on my netbook (which meets the minimum system requirements -- barely), can I transfer this to another machine?",?,"You can install the software on another computer, but don't forget to transfer the file you created for your tax return to that other computer as well."
7248,open-ended,B009CCVMNQ,What do you mean that printing is not included in Turbo Business priced at 109.99,,"Not sure where you saw this.... I looked at my software for trusts, Sub-S Corp and Estate returns and they all have filing by mail, printing for filing or for personal records, and printing to paper or to PDF files."
7249,yes/no,B009CCVMNQ,I purchased this version before seeing the printing not included and immedidately cancelled my order. Can someone answer this please?,?,"Not sure where you saw this.... I looked at my software for trusts, Sub-S Corp and Estate returns and they all have filing by mail, printing for filing or for personal records, and printing to paper or to PDF files."
7250,open-ended,B009CCVMNQ,"What does ""Printing not included"" in Turbo Tax Business mean?",,"Not sure where you saw this.... I looked at my software for trusts, Sub-S Corp and Estate returns and they all have filing by mail, printing for filing or for personal records, and printing to paper or to PDF files."
7251,yes/no,B009CCVMOU,site says state prep and printing not included in this version. Does that also include printing of the fed.,?,"I had the same question because I don't want to fall for a 'gotcha'. But if you do a search on the page for 'printing', you'll see this: ""Cost includes tax preparation and printing of unlimited federal tax returns and free federal efile, of up to five federal tax returns."" That sounds pretty clear."
7252,open-ended,B009CCVMOU,"The Amazon description of this item states that ""...printing is not included..."". Is this really true? You can not print your tax return?",,"I haven't actually tried to print a return yet, but I opened the app and checked the Help menu of this edition and it indicates that it CAN print returns and also print back-up copies for your files. Plus, all the prior year versions have allowed me to print & mail my returns without any problems."
7253,yes/no,B009CCVMOU,Can i use this program to file late 2012 taxes?,Y,Yes you can file 2012 taxes at any time but you will need to mail in the return as it cannot be submitted electronically when you file late
7254,yes/no,B009CCVMOU,Is this product for tax year 2012,?,"Turbo Tax is titled by the Tax Year. So, Turbo Tax 2012 is for the 2012 tax year that has a filing deadline of April 15, 2013."
7255,yes/no,B009CCVMOU,"does the TT let you scan in documents and attach them to the e-File ... e.g., scan in the page from my divorce decree that says I'm the primary parent",?,"There's no way to do that. If you need to add more documents, you need to mail your return. That said, sending a page from divorce decree is unlikely to help you if the other parent will also claim the child, nobody reviews supporting documents manually at the time it arrives to IRS. Should there later be discrepancy in the records, the computers willl flag it and then a request for supporting documentation would be made separately."
7256,yes/no,B009CCVMOU,Does this include state?,?,I believe it does. But you have to pay 20$ to efile state tax.
7257,yes/no,B009CCVMOU,has intuit fixed turbo tax for win 8 ?,?,"I have used Turbo Tax for 16 years. I have had Windows XP & Windows 7, but I have NEVER had Windows 8 or 8.1 so I have no idea. I would call Turbo Tax."
7258,open-ended,B009CCVMOU,Why is the PC/MAC version $6 &amp; the MAC $46? I have a 2008 MAC. Will this or the 2013 version work on it? Should I just wait for the 2013 version?,,please contact the manufacturer regarding specs we do not have any.
7259,yes/no,B009CCVMOU,"Does it allow filing for the foreign income exemption. I live in France, but file US",?,"According to Turbo taxes website, yes it does http://turbotax.intuit.com/support/iq/General-Product-Purchase/Buyer-s-Guide---If-you-live-and-work-in-a-foreign-country/GEN12399.html"
7260,yes/no,B009CCVMOU,Can it be installed on more than one computer?,?,I have installed it twice on the same computer due to a hard drive crash a couple of years back but never installed on more than one distinct computer. Can't give you a definitive answer. I have always purchased the version that includes the media for that reason.
7261,open-ended,B009CCVMO0,I was told my Mac version of 2012 turbo tax cannot be used with my version of Mac. How do I correct the problem?,,"Turbo tax 2012 for Intel based Macs, requires a 64 bit chip, not a 32 bit. First, make sure which one you have by clicking on the ""apple icon"" top left corner, then click on the drop down menu ""about this mac"". This will open a small window that will tell you what kind of processor you have on your Mac. See the processors on the list below and find out which one you have. Intel Core Solo is a 32 bit Intel Core Duo is a 32 bit Intel Core 2 Duo 64 bit Intel Quad-Core Xeon 64 bit Dual-Core Intel Xeon 64 bit Quad-Core Intel Xeon 64 bit Core i3 64 bit Core i5 64 bit Core i7 64 bit If you have an Intel core solo or an Intel core duo on your Mac, well those are 32 bit and you can not use Turbo tax 2012 for Mac. However, according to turbo tax, you can use the ""Online filing"" (not download) to file your taxes, your information will be carried over from previous years, regardless of what kind of Mac you have. This is what Bob Meighan VP from Turbo Tax wrote... "" The system specifications for the product clearly state that a 64-bit processor is required for the Mac version. There are no plans to change this since most customers are running 64-bit. For those who aren't, we encourage them to use TurboTax Online where they'll preserve all historical tax information.""

7262,open-ended,B009CCVMO0,"I went with another company with my wife and I,401 K retirement account in 2012 ,I had withdrawals from the account during 2012 What program can use?",,"I don't think there is enough information - if you are over 59 1/2 (I think that's the age) then you can withdraw from a retirement account without federal penalty. I don't know, from your question, if you have retired and maintained a 401K account or have not yet retired. When my wife left a company, she transferred her 401K to T. Row Price and had them establish a traditional IRA account. I think (my opinion) that anyone should do that because very few 401K plans have enough good mutual funds to support a retirement. If, however, whether you are or are not of retirement age when you took the distribution, I do not know how you should account for the withdrawal. I am pretty sure that the manager of the 401K plan will (must) provide you with a form 1099R to show that you took a distribution. I am certainly not qualified to advise anyone but I certainly believe that you will NEED to go to a qualified tax accountant, not a software program."
7263,open-ended,B009CCVMO0,Am considering Premier over Deluxe this yr. Is it really worth the xtra $ regarding stocks/options sales? Does Premier offer that much more guidance?,,"I would go with Premier because of the new IRS Basis of Cost rules for Stock purchased in 2011 and Mutual Fund/EFT in 2012. If you sold shares in 2012, I think Premier will guide you better through how to read and understand Box 3 and Box 6 of 1099B dealing with Uncovered and Covered Securities. You will also need to read your FI's notes about Box 3, particularly if you see a Box 3 Basis of Cost while Box 6 shows ""A"" Uncovered Securities AND you are using a different basis (FI's report Average Cost by default under Box 3). I think Premier has better guidance."
7264,yes/no,B009CCVMO0,is this for taxes to be filed by April 2013?,Y,Yes. This is the 2012 calendar year return that is to be filed by April 2013.
7265,open-ended,B009CCVMO0,Can I download TurboTax 2012 Premier to two computers? Our desktop and our laptop?,,"The information I am conveying here is based on my understanding of the license; it's not Legal Advice. I use the CD version; not the downloaded version. I do not know the answer to your question regarding the downloaded version, but there are other reasons beyond multi-device questions why you may prefer the CD anyway, so let me at least point that out. An important capability present in the CD version and ABSENT in the downloaded version is the ability to IMPORT data from brokerages, banks, and Quicken (if you use Quicken). With the CD version, as long as you have the Quicken files for the current tax year on the same computer as the TurboTax (TT) program, you will be able to use the TT Import feature to bring in all that data instead of using hand input. Now, back to the topic of muti pc use (for the CD version). I believe this is a SINGLE USER license that you can legally install on as many PCs as you like. I use three different pc's at my home to operate Quicken and TT products because I can't always have any one of them exclusively available to me at any given time for the hours it may take to do the necessary work. So, YES, I've installed both Quicken and TT Premier (from the CD) on all three pc's with no difficulty. You will want to ""register"" each installation so that whichever pc is being used you will have full access to updates and data download features included in the product. Not so incidentally, when you use more than one pc to access your files (either with Quicken or TT) an important consideration is being assured you are accessing the most-recent file(s) from each product. The easiest way to do this, in my opinion, is to store the data files that you plan to work with ""in the cloud"" using any one of the many file storage services now available. I happen to use SugarSync, which has an incredibly handy tool called ""magic briefcase"" that automatically synchronizes the files to all the PCs no matter which pc you last may have used. When you install SugarSync on each of your pcs (via download) it will create the ""magic briefcase"" folder as a new folder in MyDocuments on each pc. Every file you store in that Magic Briefcase folder will automatically be accessible to every PC running SugarSync. At the end of your FIRST SESSION you begin using this feature by saving both Quicken and TT data files to the Magic Briefcase folder on any PC from which you first start using the product. Now, make sure you are still connected to SugarSync and as soon as you save a file to that's pc's Magic Briefcase, SugarSync will start to UPLOAD if from the PC you're working on to The Cloud. (This happens in the background as long as you stay connected to the web with SugarSync running.) Be sure you don't turn off the PC until all the files are uploaded to the Cloud if you want to be sure the next time you pull a file from SugarSync's Magic Briefcase, it's the most recent version of that file. SugarSync warns you if the file hasn't been fully uploaded. If you stop it from uploading, it will resume automatically next time you start SugarSync. So let's assume you use PC#1 and save the files to Magic Briefcase. We'll also assume you allowed SugarSync to finish its prior upload to the Cloud. Then next time you want to work, lets assume you won't be using the same pc, though you could of course. Instead you use PC#3 (which already has SugarSync installed as well). You must first make sure SugarSync is running on PC#3. As soon as you turn it on and connect SugarSync, all files previously uploaded to your MagicBriefcase will automatically be pulled in from the Cloud and downloaded to your PC#3. Wait for that download to be completed. You then simply go to the Magic Briefcase folder on PC#3 and double click the file (Qkn or TT, whichever you want to use) and it will open on PC#3. (This is why you must install the Application [TT and Qkn on all the pcs you will be using.]) When you finish your work, that most recently updated file will automatically be UPLOADED from your local Magic Briefcase folder to the Cloud Magic Briefcase folder. From then on, all you have to do is keep on using Magic Briefcase on any of your PCs that run SugarSync to open the TT or Qkn files and you will be assured you have the most recent version of the file. (The backup's are also created on Magic Briefcase if you so instruct, which is a good idea.) Let me know if you need more help or specific information on how to get SugarSync."
7266,open-ended,B009CCVMO0,It says you can transfer data from H&amp;R Block Tax Cut. I assume that includes Block's new version now called At Home?,,"That is correct. TurboTax can transfer 2011 information from TaxCut aka At Home. Bob Meighan VP, TurboTax"

Can the 2012 TT sortware import my data from 2010 or do I have to enter everything again",,"If you use the online version , it does import your personal information from 2010 even if 2011 is missing.It will then ask you to confirm the info is correct. If you use the CD version, it will not import the previous version unless you provide the saved(pdf files) from previous tax filing using TT."
7271,yes/no,B009DZGMGE,Will nero 12 rip cd music to mp3 and save them on your computer to download later onto a flash drive?,?,"I used to convert all my .wma files to .mp3 using Windows Media Player. Apparently, the Microsoft gods have now eliminated that feature. I do own NERO 12 but I'm a novice NERO user. I did a little research (before writing this response) using GOOGLE and NERO 12 is indeed supposed to be able to do this conversion, according to some users. I would suggest you ask someone with more experience. I bought NERO because I used to use a stripped down version of ROXIO. Recently, I had to reload my WINDOWS 7 OS and all of a sudden ROXIO would not work with the reinstalled WINDOWS 7. Hmmm? Go figure. That's why I went to NERO. Still learning NERO. Sorry can't be of more help. As an aside, these media packages (ROXIO and NERO, and others) have gotten too ""bloated"". They try to do too much. Users get lost easily. We just want the basic stuff, done cheaply. I'll climb down from my soap box now."
7272,open-ended,B009DZGMGE,how to learn to burn onto a DVD a photo DVD,,"Ello, if your looking to just burn a DVD with photo's - there are way better & free resources available on the net. Windows - either Windows 7 or Windows 8 both allow you to ""drag & drop"" files directly to a DVD & then burin it. Nero's just ok to be honest - I bought it cause I thought it could burn ISO files & convert them to usable DVD's - it turns out it could - but so could a free app called ""Image Burn"" - which to be truthful works much better & faster + Image Burn also allows me to turn DVD's to ISO way better + it was free :-) Image Burn won't do just pictures - but the point being - Windows 7 & 8 will allow you ""drag & drop"" picture files directly & you don't have to spend extra $$$ to save them on a DVD or CD for that matter - as long as you have a DVD burner in your PC - your already good to go."

7277,yes/no,B009DZGMGE,Is this in Spanish and English languaje?,?,"I purchased NERO over the net. I used the download method. What instructions I have are in English but, NERO comes from Germany and, I think the translation is lacking somewhat? I personally, am very disappointed with NERO 12. I wanted to edit single video frames and, I still haven't figured out how to do that? NERO keeps wanting to change my videos into some kind of NERO video. Videos take a lot of memory and, this process doubles the memory needed. And, the bottom line is that I still can't edit video like I want to. I used to have NERO 6 on my old HP but, that computer is around twenty years old and, doesn't even have a single gig of RAM so, NERO quit working a few years ago. NERO 6 used to allow me to edit a single frame of video and, print it out as a jpeg. That is why I bought NERO 12 but, I can't seem to get NERO 12 to do what NERO 6 used to do. I seen a lot of translations for NERO 12 but, the bottom line is ""buyer be ware"". I would suggest trying the free trial program before you finally decide to buy."

If it is an older model you will have to encode (change it a readable format) your content. Blu-ray players should handle those extensions just fine without any encoding. This program I do not believe will do any type of encoding or file conversion. You will have to get another Nero program or some other program that will. So, burning your files, not a problem. If you dvd player accepts those extensions is another matter."

A file that can be sent to the publisher.,?,"You can certainly format the artwork for a book cover, or any other sort of illustration work, using the photo editor. As to printing such an item, that depends more on your printer than on the editor - you can resize your finished work as large as you need it, but having a printer that accomodates a corresponding paper size is a separate issue."
7301,yes/no,B009FUEQU6,"Does the tools in this program allow you to Clone, Erase, Resize, Would it allow me to redo a standard wall clock face?",?,No idea... I got frustrated with the app and stopped using it. Note: I've been doing digital retouch and graphics since PShop 1.0...

7302,yes/no,B009FUEQU6,Can you use this software to make night club flyers?,N,"Only if you want something really artistic, and are willing to spend the time to learn.

After you download and install the program, you can register it with the information that came with your disk version. The direct link to download the trial version is here: http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=photoshop_elements&loc=en_us PS: The trial version is the same as the full version.

Is v.11 top bar any clearer to those w/o perfect vision?,N,"I'm not positive what you mean by ""top bar"". File, Edit, Image, etc are all white lettering on dark grey.

Adobe can verify it using other means, but it is not as fast as using an .edu email address. See their website for registering at link: http://www.adobe.com/education/students/student-eligibility-guide.edu.html You can also call and order online. Verification other than electronic means via .edu email will require a few days for coordination, but adobe has a program to handle it with very specific eligibility requirements located at the above link.

However, I did a bit of research on the HD Pro Webcam C920 and found that it likes to make the recorded file into an H.264 format. It's basically compresses the video so that it takes less space than that of a MPEG-2 format. I would assume that it is compatible with Vegas Pro 12 since it's new. I'm surprised that there isn't that much info on this particular thing. All I can find is how to render (save) edited videos in H.264 format. The best one I can find is this link to Yahoo Answers, but it talks about an older version of Vegas Pro: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090909053518AAcMwS8 Hope this helps!"

The new version is much more stable for me and my rendering times have been cut in half. Many people may disagree, but I have found v.13 to be extremely good. Good luck."
7372,yes/no,B009H9HLVQ,"Can I buy the disc, install it onto my computer, and then resell it?",N,"No. Once you buy it, it is yours & your installation code & info are stored at Sony so if you need to re-install, you can."

Think of similar to the situation if you bought the hard disc where you could re-insert the disk after installation to install again.
7378,open-ended,B009HBCZPQ,can this download be installed on 2 or more computers? what happens if I change computers and want to install on a new computer in a year?,,"As is the case with most software, the version changes annually so last years edition won't be viable for this year (SUCKS!) Every copy I've purchased, both disc and download, was licensed for one computer only. A hidden subroutine key identifies your computer with the a specific copy of the software so if you attempt to install it on multiple machines, when it goes for updates, you'll be flagged for running without a license. I have, however, processed up to four return files for different individuals, then printed the returns out."

7382,open-ended,B009HBCZPQ,I have Microsoft 8 and am unclear about the administrative requirement noted. What does this mean?,,"I believe it will run on Windows 8 but you have to run it as administrator. After the program runs and loads you maybe asked if you are the administrator. If not right click on the program start icon, select security, and you can become the program administrator there. In all fairness be advised I have no experience with Windows 8 but do have some programs even on Windows Vista I run in Administer mode."
7383,yes/no,B009HBCZPQ,"I have a US billing address and credit cards, but live in Portugal. Can I still buy and download this program online from my home in Portugal?",?,"I cannot imagine why you couldn't.

7384,yes/no,B009HBCZPQ,"Does the 2012 tax year version, for filing 2012 taxes, also help with preparing 2013 self-employed quarterly tax filings?",?,"If I understand the question properly, the answer is yes. Based on ones input for 2012 taxes, TurboTax will estimate quarterly payments to the US and state governments for the 2013 tax year, print the government forms and inform you on the dates each quarterly payment is due."
7385,open-ended,B009HBCPS8,I've heard the Deluxe version is about the same as this - can anyone confirm that?,,Pretty much. The online version is almost exactly the same.

There's SO MANY it is CONFUSING ??,?,I'm sure you will be able to file your Limited Liability Corporation with this version. It is the most complete version offered by Intuit.

7395,open-ended,B009HBDMAS,Does the cost on Amazon include the fee for filing State as well as Federal?

Am I able to download from Amazon or do I need Snow Leopard?,,Intuit sent out an email to previous customers that stated that the Turbo Tax versions would no longer be backwards compatible with Mac OSx 10.5.8. So I believe all future versions including 2012 need to be run on Snow Leopard. I downloaded it to my new laptop that runs 10.7x. Good luck. Sorry if that wasn't the answer you were looking for. I am not part of any company and only represent 1 (one) customer's experience.

7488,yes/no,B009RHEH24,"Can 1099 data (INT, DIV, B, R) data be imported into H&amp;R Block At Home 2012 Premium &amp; Business?",?,I think it depends on who issues your 1099 for int div b & r. I know Morgan Stanley has said it could import information directly to H & R Block at Home.
7489,yes/no,B009RHEH24,Can data be imported from Quicken to this software?,Y,"Yes, it can. Block software imports most all popular financial records."
7490,yes/no,B009RHEH24,"I know the platform box PC does not show Win 8 as available, but it does show Win 8 is available as a download. Do you trust the download?",?,"H & R Block web site http://www.hrblock.com/tax-software/premium.html does not mention supporting Windows 8 on downloads. Look under computer requirements. Probably, they would try to support 8 asap. Call H & R/email them using googled website or just try the download. Comment/Question on this year's download software version ""last year they promised it ran on Window 7 but it didn't......"" Worth a double check on 8. The retail package (omitting Windows 8 on its list) may not be able to run 8 so I would try the download version if you just gotta run Windows 8."
7491,yes/no,B009RHEH24,Will Premium &amp; Business 2012 run on Windows 8,N,"NO. The commercial sales box does not mention Windows 8 as being supported by this tax program. Windows 7, Vista and XP are the listed minimum system requirement. It may be possible that Windows 8 may allow you to run in Windows 7 mode but I wouldn't count on it. Consider having your computer guru put Windows 7, or better yet, XP, on your work machine."
7492,yes/no,B009RHEAEY,"Does ""Basic"" include free e-filing for STATE returns as well?",?,"Yes, I just filed Fed/NYS last night- no xtra charge for state"

Plus it adds One ""Live Session with a H&R Block Tax Proffesional"". I used to buy the Dlx version for the included State Program. But I didnt need the extras. Basic with State is fine for my situation. H&R Block has a website with more info."

7495,yes/no,B009RHEAEY,is this the same as taxcut,?,"""At Home"" is the new name for H & R Block's ""Tax Cut"" Software."
7496,yes/no,B009RHEBWA,Is there a limit on how many people can file their tax using it?,?,"This response is for the actual software shipped to you and NOT the download which *might* work differently. ~~ In previous years, I have used the software to file my own taxes and then passed it to a friend who also used it for her own taxes, including using the efile. (I never registered the product with H&R Block and she even has a different address than me.) I have not finished my taxes for this year yet, but if the previous years are any indication, then it *should* work again the same way. I find no indication that they have limited the e-files so that only ONE user can use them, i.e., nothing on the box or in the material says that."
7497,yes/no,B009RHEBWA,Does 2012 Deluxe + state work with Windows 8 ?,Y,"Yes, it does."
7498,open-ended,B009RHEBWA,Does this version include any free files? Can that info be added to the description?,,"Has 5 free Federal, no free State files. Can print and mail as many as you like. Russ O."

7502,yes/no,B009RHEBWA,Does it handle Trad IRA to Roth conversion in TY 2012? I know it did for TY 2010. TurboTax 2012 does not handle Roth conversion,?,"Yes, Roth conversions are definitely supported at the form level. I started using Block 2012 as soon as the first download was available. A big reason was to estimate how much to convert this year. I don't recall that Roth conversion was in the original interview, but I'll check. Also, I bet that the forms are available in Turbo Tax too. Update, conversion is there in the interview too."
7503,yes/no,B009RHEBWA,I have multiple annuities and unemployment income. My self-employed wife files a Schedule C etc. Does this product handle these?,?,"Schedule C, without a doudt. Unemploryment, any income. Annuities, I'm not 100% sure here, but would say 90% sure it will. It does 1099-d, any long or short stocks, so I see no reason annuities would be left out. FYI. All my Scottrade stuff downloaded into 2011."

7509,open-ended,B009SPJ14O,"Why does the title say Office Startup when I open the program? It's not like this on my full version of Office 2013 installed on my laptop. I neglected to include this earlier, but by all other appearances, it seems to be the complete version of Word...",,"Microsoft has created these individual component products as gateways to facilitate purchase of additional Office components as part of the consolidated Office offerings.

7517,yes/no,B009SPJ05E,Do you have to re-purchase this once a year?,?,"Once it's purchased then this specific version is available for life on your Amazon account, even if you need to redown load it. If you want a newer version in the future then that would have to be purchased of course."
7518,open-ended,B009SPJ05E,what is the difference between a key card and the down load,,No difference that I can see. Just have to hang onto the key card to reload.

7523,yes/no,B009SPJ05E,Can this convert older Microsoft Works documents to Word?,Y,"As far as I know yes... It converts all of my documents from Microsoft word 2010. That's the oldest version I have, use, and know of for sure."

7525,yes/no,B009SPJ05E,Is this compatible with Windows 7?,N,NO. Win7 does not uttilize the necessary bytes. To install. Upgrading to 8 is the only was to ensure correct I stallation.

7530,open-ended,B009SPN9O2,what is a key card?,,They send you a card with a code on it then you will use that code to download outlook from Microsoft's website. It is very convenient not having to deal with a CD. Or also allows you to transfer it to a different device by simply going to Microsoft's website again. This is if you get another computer or something.

7543,open-ended,B009SPJ88S,Is this a disc or key card? If it is a key card then why is there shipping involved?,,"We have this item available as "" Microsoft Access 2013 Key Card (No Disc)"" which is a key card, no disc. Please let us know if we can be of any further assistance."
7544,yes/no,B009SPJ88S,I have MS Office 2010 without MS Access.. Can I install MS Access 2013 along with MS Office 2010?,?,"it ought to be possible... but knowing Microsoft as I do, I'd try real hard to find a 2010 version of access.

7549,yes/no,B009SPK1DY,Is this version a subscription product that has to be renewed every year?,Y,"I just purchased this new version but I have publisher 98 and I still installs over and over again and runs fine on windows 8.

7560,yes/no,B009SPJ478,Can this be used without the other components of Microsoft Office?,N,No. It does not help anything. Useless.
7561,open-ended,B009SPJ478,How big a download is this? (e.g. 2.4GB),,"I am not sure, that info should be provided by Amazon or you could go to the Microsoft website and they should be able to help you. Just be aware that you cannot use this product by itself without Microsoft office. I thought I could buy it and use it alone, but I had to purchase something from Microsoft to use it and had the option to pay one lump sum or a monthly charge. I did not want to do that,so I returned it and went to paper accounting and I am very happy with that. Only on occasion do I miss Excel spreadsheet."

7565,open-ended,B009SPL2K0,how does office professional 2013 pc key card function?,,"You receive a card in the mail (it looks almost like a credit card) and you start to download Office 2013... It will ask you for the key number, and you then type in the number (it is about 20 digits long) from the card. That proves you have bought it and the download begins."
7566,yes/no,B009SPL2K0,Can a student use this office professional 2013 too?,?,yes. I don't see why not. It is easy to use and has all the Microsoft software that a college or HS student would need plus.
7567,yes/no,B009SPL2K0,IS this the program I would use with a new surface?,Y,"Yes .. definitely. The newer version of Office is more geared towards tablet use, Pen/handwriting recognition and some hand gestures"

This happened to me. We had purchased the product through Amazon Prime. Amazon was fulfilling the sale for another company. Amazon refunded our money and permitted the return even though we had opened the package and attempted to install it. Make sure that you tell them that the product is apparently not valid for sale in the US. If you look on the box or on any outer labels, the version you have is likely valid for sale only in Asia or Australia or some other region rather than the US."

If I have two users on 1 PC (my wife and I have separate accounts), can just one of us use it?",?,Both users will be able to use it. What they really mean is 1 household.

7572,yes/no,B009SPL2K0,does this work with a mac computer?,?,"No, you need a MAC specific version of office. This version will only work on a PC with the minimal SW and HW requirements listed on Microsoft Office 2013 web site."
7573,open-ended,B009SPL2K0,Why is there a price difference between the pkc vs download version??,,I don not believe there is. Maybe shipping id its extra.

Word and Excel work fine with my new Dell desktop windows 7. Except for Outlook, which is horrible piece of garbage I removed and installed from a copy of Office 2007."
7578,open-ended,B009SPWJ98,"What is the difference between the ""PC Download"" and ""PC Key Card"" options? It's a $55 difference in price, but it's not clear what the difference is",,"In the past there were differences between the DVD version and the keycard/download as far as licensing went - the latter you weren't legally able to transfer to another PC. Amazon is showing the following disclaimer for both of these products: ""Update: Microsoft updated the Office 2013 license. You may now transfer the software to another computer that belongs to you, but not more than one time every 90 days (except due to hardware failure, in which case you may transfer sooner). If you transfer the software to another computer, that other computer becomes the ""licensed computer."" So the obvious difference seems to be that the key-card is being sold cheaper than what Amazon can provide the 'download' version for. (It's being sold by a 3rd party) Both of these options will require you to download the software from Microsoft, however."
7579,open-ended,B009SPWJ98,"I'm unclear about the Office 2013 licence ""One-time purchase for life of PC"" condition. What if I install it and in 2 years buy a new laptop.",,"Not sure if you are still looking for the answer, but for anybody else who is still wondering, Microsoft has updated the licensing (due to numerous complaints) and Amazon has kindly inserted it at the top of the product description: Update: Microsoft updated the Office 2013 license. You may now transfer the software to another computer that belongs to you, but not more than one time every 90 days (except due to hardware failure, in which case you may transfer sooner).

7582,yes/no,B009SPWJ98,Am I reading correctly that they Key Card version is transferable every 90 days but the download version is non-transferable at all?,?,"Hello Jovan, yes the key card version license you may transfer to a different computer but you have to wait 90 days between. As far as ""download version"", if we send a product via email, we have the physical product (key card) and simply expedite the process of it getting to you by taking the full retail package, getting the key code, and link off of it for you to send via email. Sending via email it is still the full retail keycard, however I can not speak for other companies sending downloads, because I do not know how they process those."

Return the product and then download a free Home/Office suite. Most like Micros soft office. WPS office suite. (was Kingsoft Office.) Free. I have the MS paid Version and I do not use it anymore.

7587,open-ended,B009SPTUW2,"Other than being just a tad less expensive (at the outset anyway), what is the advantage to the Key Card vs. Download?",,"If you're looking at this product page, they're the same thing. With the key card you have to wait to get a card printed with a physical number mailed to you. The number is in your amazon account when you do the download (I assume). So if you can wait a week, get the key card. You have to download from Microsoft and create a Microsoft account either way. Either way this is a subscription product that expires after a year and all of the software stops working if you let it expire."
7588,yes/no,B009SPTUW2,Amazon states Access is included with Home Premium. The Box for Home Premium does not list Access. Is Access included?,?,"Yes it is included with the purchase of ""office 365 home premium""....the confusion occurs because because the ""office 365"" (1 year subscription) includes access....whereas the stand alone license (non-subsciption version) of office home premium does not include access Update (8/1/2013): I believe Microsoft is using this as a cleaver way of encouraging people to start buying the subscription based service. The stand alone license only includes Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote...But Home premium 365 (subscription) includes those basics and also adds in Publisher, Outlook, Access, 20gb of Skydrive, and some free skype minutes...here is a link to see the comparison: http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/cat/categoryID.62684700"
7589,open-ended,B009SPTUW2,"Will Office products work (after downloading) if I don't have an internet connection, or is it all cloud based?",,Actually to clear it up for everyone. It will work for 3 months with no internet connection. After the 3rd month with no Software Update ran across the internet it will back you down to the view only version that has no access to create and edit new documents. Been using Office 365 for a few years
7590,yes/no,B009SPTUW2,does this key work to renew a subscription?,Y,Yes. I renewed my subscription with this.
7591,yes/no,B009SPTUW2,will this work with windows 7?,Y,"Yes, it will work with Windows 7."
7592,yes/no,B009SPTUW2,Does it work on windows 8.1,Y,"Yes, that's what I installed it on"
7593,yes/no,B009SPTUW2,Is there a reason that I can't order this for my small business?,?,"I have no idea why you can not get a version of Office 365 Home for your business especially if it's in your home. But be thankful for small favors. I used Office 2007 for years and after my year subscription it out, I'll go back to Office 2007 much cleaner and easier software to work with, Office 365 is a pain in the rear. you can go on ""ebay"" and get a copy of Office 2007 Pro or Office 2010 Pro and you'll be a much HAPPIER person. With a lot of fewer headaches!"
7594,yes/no,B009SPTUW2,"Can I buy this for renewal purpose? i already have office 365, just need to renew. But online renewal is $99. Thanks!",?,Yes! Yes! I did exactly this. Apply the product code to your account. The expiration date of subscription extends by one year.
7595,open-ended,B009SPTUW2,"Okay, so what's the rub? Word, Excel, PP, Access, Outlook just like at work for $66/year?",,"No rub. Having said that, you may be on a different version at work, e.g., Office 2007, 2010, or 2013. However, its compatible, had no problem opening any of the old documents. The catch, you only get 1 terabyte, yes, 1 terabyte of OneDrive cloud storage. So, after you install, just move your documents into OneDrive and you have cloud backup as long as you keep renewing. You can put anything in OneDrive, not just Office files. The software itself resides on your hard drive and updates are automatic."
7596,yes/no,B009SPTUW2,"Since I don't own 5 computers or 5 other compatible devices, can i share Office 365 Home premium with other family members?",Y,"Yes, you can go to https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/MyAccount.aspx to invite other users (via email) to share some of your licenses. I don't think you have to log with your own credentials on their machine if you send them an invite that way."
7597,open-ended,B009SPUE72,What is the difference between the PC Download version and the PC Key Card version? Both seem to require you to download the software from office.com. The PC Key Card is cheaper so what am I losing if I choose that option?,,PC Key card version means that they will physically send you a box with a printed key and web site address. You use the key to download the software from that website. This process takes about a week. This means that somebody holds your money for about a week before you get your product. PC download means that you may start downloading right after purchasing the software.
7598,open-ended,B009SPUE72,So if I buy the key card as opposed to the PC download do I have to buy it every year or is it good forever?,,"The key card is used when the software is preloaded on a new PC. In this case, the software cannot be transferred to another computer and it is good forever on that computer. If you download the software onto your PC, that software cannot be transferred to another computer and is good forever. The only difference is with the key card you don't have to download anything. But in either case the software is good forever on that original computer."
7599,yes/no,B009SPUE72,"If my computer crashes, can I transfer/use this on another computer?",?,"I doubt it. It is registered on one computer. If you were able to use it on another computer, why not 3 other computers. I do know that if you lose Office on your computer you can load it over and over on the same computer. I have done it 3 times due to virus protection wiping out the software."
7600,yes/no,B009SPUE72,Does this install separately so my older version of Office 2010 will still be available to me? I need to have access to both versions for training.,N,"No, it does not. It overwrites the old version. Also the product key does not work if you change your country in installation i.e. you can't buy the product in US and install it in a computer in UK."
7601,yes/no,B009SPUE72,will work with window 8.1,Y,"Yes, works well with windows 8.1"
7602,yes/no,B009SPUE72,will this work on a lap top?,Y,yes we downloaded to windows 7 laptop
7603,yes/no,B009SPUE72,"Is this for a one year, one computer user license?",N,"No, thankfully this is not a one year license. It's just that you have to set up a MS email account to download this product. If you have used MS 2010 you will probably be disappointed in the quality of this product."
7604,open-ended,B009SPUE72,What is a key card?,,A key card is simply a small card in the box that contains the key (a series of letters and numbers much like a password but longer) that allows you to access the download function of the website. So if you have the key card you can download the software from the internet!
7605,open-ended,B009SPUE72,If I download product do I also receive boxed?,,No
7606,open-ended,B009SPUE72,Do I pay this amount every year or once I buy it I no longer pay?,,Do you mean the price? It's a single user purchase price that you pay once.
7607,yes/no,B009TUYB16,Will this repair missing NVRD32 file?,?,I don't know. It was a bust for me.
7608,open-ended,B009TUYB16,Will this disk open the original installed windows XP that will not open when I did a CK Disk and now all I get is a blue screen or black screen?,,"Yes, it will"
7609,open-ended,B009TUYB16,wi this disk work on an HP dv6130us with Windows XP Media Center edition?,,Should work on any XP machine. I have a Dell with XP MC Edition.
7610,yes/no,B009TUYB16,was it the Windows XP that would not boot for you? I get an error message that reads: missing boot.ini before windows even got a chance to open,?,"Hey Michelle: I got one of those blue screens with all kinds of error messages on it. I could not go any further no matter how many times turned off and on the computer. The windows recovery disk did help, however it erases the drivers or software for your dvd drive and your sound and printer and all your other software like word, etc. The cd will work while the dvd portion doesn't. You will also need to buy a windows xp drivers disk which you can buy on ebay for about $10 in or to get your sound and dvd to work. Assuming you get your computer to work and it should, then you need to reinstall all your other programs including printer software. Best of luck, Elliott"
7611,open-ended,B009TUYB16,My computer went thru recovery now it won't update windows to a newer version will this help,,It really should Reboot if you have the proper administrator password but some older machines won't let you download a better IExplorer. You have to check to see what version is on your machine. If it says you have the latest version of internet explorer it will not upgrade.
7612,yes/no,B009TUYB16,will this help me with the corrurpt file that wont let me start the computer and only sends me to the logo screen,?,Unfortunately I don't believe it will. Mine was doing the same thing as some startup files were erased and it would not allow me to go past startup. This disk was completely useless in helping me at all. I spent 50.00 on repair disks only to have to buy a Windows refurbished computer drive for a few more dollars. Hope this helps you.
7613,yes/no,B009TUYB16,"Upon turning on my computer gives this message, ""Windows can not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \windows\system32\config\system"". Will this disc help to solve the problem?",?,"This particular disk did not work for me. However, the customer service and technician support was outstanding. I highly recommend trying the product based on how they treat you post purchase."
7614,yes/no,B009TUYB16,would this disk remove a blue screen of death from boot?,Y,yes but first pull power cord and battery and hold down on power button for 10 seconds put battery back insert disk before you power up.
7615,yes/no,B009TUYB16,does this recovery disk works on compaq presario window xp?,?,I threw mine in the trash so I don't know. It didn't do anything for my computer.
7616,yes/no,B009TUYB16,will it reformat a hard drive,Y,I had no luck with this. It might work if you have more computer knowledge than I have.
7617,open-ended,B009VL9YGU,Hi 1) is this license for 4 years ? 2) Am I going to have the office installed on my drive or I have to access thru a cloud? thanks,,"1) Yes it is for 4 years but you have to renew each year online 2) The office is installed on your drive. The pack doesn't include a CD so you have to download it online using the provided serial number. After you do so, office is downloaded on your drive and you don't need to have internet access to use it."
7618,open-ended,B009VL9YGU,"what if my computer has to be replaced within the 4 years, how do I reload without having to pay?",,"Easy, when you first register your Office 365, you have an Administrator screen. When you replace the computer, you go to your personal Office 365 Admin Screen, and you deactivate your old computer new and you have a new Office 365 license to install on the new computer."
7619,yes/no,B009VL9YGU,can the two downloads be for one pc and one mac?,?,"From what I can tell, you can install on PC and Mac. I have installed on a PC and when I go to my account to download my second install, the option to install for Mac is still accessible. I hope this helps. I also haven't come across anything that says you can not install like you are requesting."
7620,open-ended,B009VL9YGU,What's difference between key cards and download versions if the program is supposed to be downloaded from MS website? Thanks.,,"Hey. In my case, it was a bit cheaper to buy the key card. Whatever you decide, you're gonna be good."
7621,yes/no,B009VL9YGU,"Is Long Beach College, CA a valid institution?",?,Probably. Any accredited school should work fine. I think they just need your email for the school.
7622,yes/no,B009VL9YGU,do we have to pay again when renew this product 12 months later?,Y,"This item is a four year key. With that said, when the key expires you have to pay again. In other terms, it's subscription based."
7623,yes/no,B009VL9YGU,"The product in the photo says for PC or Mac, but the requirements for OS say Windows. Has anyone tried this on a Mac?",?,You can use this on mac but it's the online client only
7624,open-ended,B009VL9YGU,pc key card,,"Yes, it uses a key card. I couldn't get this product to load either though. The key card's number wasn't complete. I tried getting the product to work with Microsoft once, but they couldn't get it to work either and I wasn't interested enough in the software to keep battling with it. Google Docs is free and works fine for everything I need."
7625,open-ended,B009VL9YGU,"if this is loaded onto two computers, used by two different people, do both people have to be students? does 2nd person use student's signon?",,"Can be used by 2 different people--It is kind of on the honor system--but as far as I can tell you have to use one person's Microsoft login for both. So, second person's copy of Office would have first person's name attached to it."
7626,open-ended,B009WLN5M8,will Photo Explosion 5 work with windows 8? If not which one does?,,I am presently using the program with windows 7 without any problems. The box says that it will also work with windows 8.
7627,open-ended,B009WLN5M8,How does this item compare to uleads photoimpact ver4.0? which I liked very much but won't work on win 8.1,,I loved the version before this Deluxe 5. I had it figured out and used it ALL the time. The updated version is TOTALLY different and difficult to use. It was a HUGE disappointment. I would NOT recommend buying it.
7628,open-ended,B009WLN5M8,where do i find the activation key,,I have not idea. Sorry I couldn't help you. Pose the question to the rest of the reviewers.
7629,yes/no,B009WLN5M8,Am I able to create an logo with this software?,?,This software is not worth anyone time or money... from install it always crash!
7630,open-ended,B009WLN5M8,With this software can I remove shadows? Also is it easy to use I am a beginner at this.,,"I did not like this software at all and basically gave up on it. I am sorry if you purchased it. I had the 2.0 version and loved it, so I upgraded. What a huge disappointment. I wish I would have kept my 2.0."
7631,open-ended,B009WLN5M8,I cannot register my photo explosion deluxe 5.0 software - serial number isn't fitting in designated fields.,,Make sure you do not include dash separators. Also you may have caps included in the number. I purchased this program from another vendor and thought it was terrible. I could not burn any type of dvd with this. I wanted to make slideshows as advertized on the box but you have to download bonus software to do this. It still did not work. I bought Wondershare DVD Creator after trying the unpaid version. It works very well and is very user friendly. Good luck!! I made the slideshows with Movie Maker then burned dvds with Wondershare.
7632,yes/no,B009WLN5M8,Can I add music,?,This program to is manipulate photos only as far as I understand. If you are contemplating buying it I would say don't do it. I have purchased it and have been very disappointed. I loved the Version 2 of it and wish they would bring it back. Hope this helps.
7633,open-ended,B009WLN5M8,"Why do I get ""Photo explosion has stopped working""?",,All I can suggest is to contact the company and bitch big time. Seems to be the only alternative .
7634,yes/no,B009WLN5M8,Can I download photos from Picasa web album to Photo Explosion 5,N,Sorry. I can't help you with this one. I don't honestly know. I no longer have Photo Explosion 5.
7635,yes/no,B009WLN5M8,Does Photo Explosion Version 5 have a web location to store Photo's,N,"I do not know. Sorry. It's probably best not to use this program. But you could email the Nova Company and ask them, but you might have to pay $$ to have them answer you."
7636,yes/no,B009WX55T2,Does this include theft protection?,?,"It gives you the ability to track it, look through the camera and even turn on an automobile sounding alarm. Cool stufff!"
7637,open-ended,B009WX55T2,The fine print states this is a renewable contract. How long is the coverage for before it has to be renewed?,,The coverage is for 1 year. Just forget about the renewable contract. When it is time to renew your phone will send a warning. Go to Amazon to purchase again at a discount rate. At first to install scan with Norton Snap. To re-install is some what confusing. Go to settings Apps Norton Clear Data Open Sign-in then Activated.
7638,yes/no,B009WX55T2,"Is there any point to using Norton Mobile Security when the device is wi-fi, used only at home?",Y,Yes. It's keeps your phone protected at all times. WiFi can be hacked.
7639,yes/no,B009WX55T2,"If bought on Norton.com, Symantec provides free 24x7 chat, and phone support for 1 year. Do I get the same if I buy from you/Amazon?.",?,"I know that there is phone service available any time if you get infected by a virus or spyware. Although, any other technical support is suppose to be handled through their online support."
7640,yes/no,B009WX55T2,I bought this on a promotion with $8.00 off because I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 inch tab. Ipuccagirl73 said I can download this. Should I?,?,this is a great product and it would benefit you to downloadbetter to purchase though because you get more
7641,open-ended,B009WX55T2,Is it better to order the disk or download it straight from amazon to my tablet?,,"I installed it on my phone, so I have no experience with a tablet. However, I have never had a problem downloading anything from Amazon, so I would probably go that route."
7642,yes/no,B009WX55T2,Will this work on a Kindle Fire HDX.,Y,"as long as it is Norton Mobile Security Lite: Kindle Fire Edition, see Norton or kindle site for specifications."
7643,open-ended,B009WX55T2,On android does it force you to install all the programs with norton or can you select which ones you want. Easy to uninstall Norton?,,I believe Norton runs in the background. You are NOT forced to do anything. Easy to UN-install just like may other programs.
7644,yes/no,B009WX55T2,Does this work on kindle?,N,No!
7645,open-ended,B009WX55T2,I'm currently using the 30 day trial. To what degree am I protected with the free portion once the trial ends?,,you should be ok if you just use regular internet searches etc. you will get request to update though though and if you sign the Eula agreement it will occasionally pop up wanting you to update and if you do that you will constantly get requests to buy
7646,yes/no,B009XD6D6U,"Can I install this program on more than one computer when I buy it? I have it on desktop, but want to put it on my laptop and my daughter's for travel",Y,I have this program on both my desktop and laptop computers and it works fine.
7647,yes/no,B009XD6D6U,Will this run in Windows 7?,Y,"Yes, that's what I'm using..."
7648,yes/no,B009XD6D6U,will it open 2010 files?,Y,"Did for me. When installed, it searched for old Quicken files and put them in 2013 format. Quicken usually cuts off support and internet updates on the older versions to ""encourage"" you to upgrade."
7649,yes/no,B009XD6D6U,Have the bugs in the 2013 program been fixed? I'm afraid to buy the 2014 version after reading reviews so will buy the older version if it works better.,?,"I bought Quicken 2013, but I did not use it because it would not load data from my 2001 Quicken. I bought the 2002 version instead and found it very satisfactory."
7650,yes/no,B009XD6D6U,can it import Microsoft Money 2007 files?,?,I doubt it!
7651,open-ended,B009XD6D6U,What is the difference between Quicken Premier 2013 and Quicken Premier 2013 (OLD VERSION),,"I am sorry that I don't know. I have Q for investments, but didn't have it previously as I was using a very old version. Good luck!"
7652,yes/no,B009XD6D6U,can it run alone without the internet?,Y,"Yes. However you won't get any updates and you won't be able to download cleared transactions from the banks and you won't be able to enter payments in Quicken and then sync with your bank. However there are loads of features that don't need the internet like budgeting, check register etc. Even if I wasn't on-line I would still find it indispensable."
7653,yes/no,B009XD6D6U,does this version run on windows 8,Y,Yes it does. I had no problems running it.
7654,open-ended,B009XOVKEY,How many CAL's does this server support?,,"Windows server 2012 essentials does not use CALs. It has a 25 user limit, meaning you can have 25 user accounts in active directory. Keep in mind this version of server hits the ground running as primary domain controller and must be the primary dc for the domain. Also does NOT support hyper-v like server standard does."
7655,open-ended,B009XOVKEY,"is this download version or CD version? if download version, do u have CD/DVD version?",,"DVD Version, is genuine. I have DVD version."
7656,open-ended,B009XOVKEY,Other than the hardware Is this all I would need to set up a server for a small business with about 10 users?,,"As long as all you are going to do is let them look at files up to 25 users It will not run any programs except for the admin users. You will need a static IP address or take what could be complicated steps to set up dynamic connection to work. So if all you are going to do is share files try google drive, it is free, no need to worry about backing up, hardware, and it is always up and running. It even supports use of spreadsheet, wordprocessor, etc. I would need to know what you are trying to accomplish. If you ant to serve programs liek Quickbooks, etc you will need to go the Windows Standard and buy two different sets of licenses unless all the people will be at the same location then you only need user CALs. This route will consume a lot of time to set up your own business server, you better love IT."
7657,open-ended,B009XOVKEY,Looking to buy - if I buy this do I get the upgrade to R2 when it comes out in a couple of weeks or should I hold off?,,"It is my understanding that there will be a fee for the ""update"" known as R2 when Microsoft finally releases it (how much is widely debated). There is no SOLID yes or no answer from MS Corp. but if you look at trends in the past with MS Server/Enterprise/SQL/VB type software, you can bet your sweet patootie that MS is going to want a few bucks for the new features in the R2 release."
7658,open-ended,B009XOVKEY,I believe product code G3S-00123 is an OEM product? Is this the OEM version or the retail version (which I understand is G3S-00141)?,,This product code is listed on Newegg as an OEM product.
7659,open-ended,B009XOVKEY,"Also, the question below was never answered - is this OEM or retail?",,"As far as I am aware, this product is an OEM version of the software. Meaning it comes with a license sticker to be placed on the machine in question and the individual who purchases/installs the software is responsible for supporting the server it is installed on."
7660,open-ended,B009XOVKEY,You can switch from English to Spanish language by downloading the package?,,"Dunno, never tried. Might try a Google search on the subject."
7661,open-ended,B009YLQLHW,"Can I have this on two of my computers, or am requested to purchase two downloads?",,"I hope this helps, Microsoft announced on their website the following ""Today we announce the end of another era, the discontinuation of Microsoft Streets & Trips. We so appreciate the support of our dedicated users over the years. ""The success of these products would never have happened were it not for the loyal and supportive fans who purchased the product and its various iterations over the years,"" shares Larry Petersen, test lead for Microsoft Streets & Trips. ""Speaking at RV rallies over the years, I've loved hearing about our avid customers' experiences using the software to plan and enjoy road trips across North America."" This retirement will not affect software already installed. Current users may continue to use Streets & Trips to plan their travel adventures and will have online support until July 14, 2015. Streets & Trips 2013 will be available for purchase until December 31, 2014. "" at this rate I do not know that Microsoft informed the distribution channels (Amazon). You can install on 2 computers but without updates, maps become useless. I will be changing; to what I change to is unknown. Good luck - Baker"
7662,yes/no,B009YLQLHW,I am downloading the trial version from MS. Can I purchase the software from Amazon and use it to upgrade the MS trial version? Is a Code provided.,Y,Yes.
7663,open-ended,B009YLQLHW,I have 2010 with thumb drive. I have over 600 pinned locations which are saved on hard drive. With updating to 2013 will I be able to use old maps?,,"I answered this earlier as a negatory. Now I wonder if you couldn't EXPORT as a GPX from your Older version (if it supports it) and then IMPORT as a GPX to 2013? I already know that as an .est file, 2013 won't import a 2010 file. Have already removed the 2010 trial version and have to see if I can reinstall it to use up what's left of the 60 day trial. If it works, will amend my review of the product accordingly. UPDATE 5/17: Reinstalled the trial version with 21 days left. You CAN import (via GPX) a ROUTE ONLY from an earlier version that supports exporting to a GPX file. All that is transferred are the origination point, stops that are shown and the destination that are part of the original .est Route Planner screen. You have to recalculate the route. The names you gave those points in Route Planner transfer, too. However, ALL OTHER PUSHPINS and associated information that you may have entered for scenic points, landmarks, that are not included in the original Route DO NOT transfer. So, I guess one could conclude that an import to 2013 from an earlier version is only a qualified success. I have many routes annotated with GPS coordinates for interesting locations, springs found while hiking, etc. While the ROUTE transferred, the rest of the information did not."
7664,open-ended,B009YLQLHW,"I think I already know the answer, but if I download this and have issues with the download or install failing, can I get a refund or do I lose $35?",,"You can restart the download or download at a later date. They send an email with a link to the download. And it's in your Amazon account. The email and account also contains the activation code. What I did is downloaded an evaluation version from Microsoft and installed it. This gave me a look see, to see if I would like it. I then ordered Streets from Amazon and just activated it with the Amazon code."
7665,yes/no,B009YLQLHW,is this compatible with hp 2000computer with windows8,?,I have it on w 8.1
7666,yes/no,B009YLQLHW,"My older version (2009) also covered Mexico, does the 2013 version?",?,Mine does cover Mexico.
7667,yes/no,B009YLQLHW,I had to restore my computer. Can I re download,Y,"yes, if you have your receipt with the ID on it, you can go the the website and download it again. Actually if you have your user name and password, you won't even need your receipt. Your order will be in there under your order history. Love the program"
7668,open-ended,B009YLQLHW,Are the maps updated on an ongoing basis. Or would I be stuck with 2 year old maps?,,Not updated. Must buy newer version
7669,open-ended,B009YLQLHW,"How do you enlarge the icons for ""places""? I am including 'Hotels' in my my map and the markers are microscopic and impossible to select.",,"Create a custom symbol You can create your own custom symbols for Streets & Trips by using the appropriate image editor. Supported file formats for custom symbols Streets & Trips supports the following file formats for custom symbols: Uncompressed Windows bitmap (.bmp) file format with a maximum size limit of 128 128 pixels and color depth of 16 or 24 bits Windows icon (.ico) resource file format with a maximum size limit of 128 128 pixels and a color depth of 16 or 24 bits Windows cursor (.cur) file format with a maximum size limit of 128 128 pixels and a color depth of 16 or 24 bits About the custom symbols color palette Because Streets & Trips maps use different color palettes at different times to render things on the map, use the colors in the following palette to make sure that your custom symbols have an exact color match of your design after they are imported. The colors in this palette are always available. If you use colors other than those in this color palette, Streets & Trips will determine the closest colors available from its current color palette and use them instead. Note A sample bitmap file that uses the colors in the custom symbols palette was installed to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Streets & Trips 2013\Samples\ when you installed Streets & Trips. This is the default installation location of the sample files. If you installed Streets & Trips in a different location, use Search or Find in Windows Explorer to locate the Samples folder."
7670,yes/no,B009YLQLHW,Is Microsoft Streets and Trips 2013 compatible with Windows 8?,?,"Yes; just like you probably, I checked where I could but no reference to Win 8, so I just gambled. Works fine."
7671,yes/no,B009YLXNI2,Will this record live steaming content?,?,"The short answer: Yes. The longer explanation: Audials records streaming video such as Netflix, YouTube, etc easily. However it only records video from your TV when used with other apps. Your PC must have a either an attached TV card or video capture device which allows you to view live stream video on your PC, then yes, you can record the streaming video. I, myself, use an AverTV USB HD DVR Capture Device (Model C874) and its associated software: AverMedia Total Media Extreme to view live streaming video. I don't like to record the video in their TS format because the file size is very large, so I use Audials to record the streaming video on the PC."
7672,open-ended,B009YLXNI2,"Can you burn a streaming video onto a DVD that' can be used on a typical DVD Player? If so, does the vid quality degrade?",,"I use Audials MovieBox 10 to record from DVDs and streaming video and then store on my hard drive to watch on my PLEX server. I can say that the videos I have recorded, from what ever source (streaming video or DVDs), had no noticeable video degradation."
7673,open-ended,B009YLXNI2,I am not able to record a using Audials Moviebox 10 from Netflix (for example) and then play the recorded DVD on my DVD player. How is it done?,,"Typically, I use Adobe tools to take the video file to produce a DVD and this works well."
7674,open-ended,B009Z3UW1A,1. Will this software work with Windows 8.1? 2. Can we use the same software with an iMAC and a PC?,,notionmusic.com says yes. it even has an app for your ipad. i do not use apple but it loaded on my windows 7 machine perfectly. i would doubt that you would have any problems with windows 8. contact notion support if you are not sure. they do answer their emails.
7675,yes/no,B009Z3UW1A,Can you save the notes in pdf format?,?,"Well, if you are referring to the Mac version, no. but, you can save it as a PDF if you print it."
7676,open-ended,B009Z3UW1A,"what comes with the software, i.e. manual, dvd, etc?",,"I received an Install Disc and a Quick Reference Guide with my purchase. If you need more information, there is documentation and tutorials online."
7677,open-ended,B009Z3UW1A,Does this include the instruments? Or do you have to buy them separately?,,"If you are talking about the sound loops, yes, all the basic instruments are there. There are some more exotic sounds that you have to buy separately."
7678,open-ended,B009Z3UW1A,"I am leaning toward getting this, but my specific need/wish is to be able to print sheet music that I've composed. I would assume that Notion can do this but can someone please verify? Thanks!",,Yes you can
7679,yes/no,B009Z3UW1A,"If I insert chord symbols over the staff, then later use the ""transpose"" utility, are the chord symbols also changed? Tks! gsw",Y,"Well, I had never used that utility before, but I tried it and it seems like it works. I put in an Eb7,Ebm7, then eb7 just to test it. Then I transposed chromatically up a perfect 4th and it changed the chord symbols to Ab7, Abm7, and Ab7. Just a bit more: Playback quality on Notion is much more pleasing than Finale and notation is quicker and more convenient with keyboard shortcuts and easy access to written notes. (click and drag them instead of having to search of the pitch change tool). The only ups I've found with Finale vs Notion is thta Finale gives you more options with notation appearances. You can place things exacty where YOU want like crescendos, text, pedal markings, dynamics. notion also lets you do this, but it has this kind of auto correct placement thing where it snaps the dynamic cyou pick under the beat you placed it on. this is still pretty accurate and you can still move thingsaround but a little less. I personally prefer Notion - it's altogether more convenient and satisfying in my opinion. :)"
7680,yes/no,B009Z3UW1A,I have a multi-keyboard setup. Can more than one MIDI keyboard be used for input simultaneously?,N,"Hello Paul. I was requested to provide you with an answer; however, actually I haven't yet used the software. Also, I do not input music using keyboards, but rather directly through the sequencer ""step mode"". Apologies for not being able to help, but I had to at least respond to the request. Good luck anyway."
7681,yes/no,B009Z3UW1A,Does this work with Windows 7?,Y,"Yes, awesome product and easy to use"
7682,yes/no,B00A3N5W9S,I understand Fluenz requires a code that is sent upon purchase or is in the box that allows the purchaser to use the discs.

It sounds like you're asking about the serial number, which is required in order to activate and use the software. We do include this code with your purchase, normally it will come via email shortly after you complete your order. If you don't receive it for whatever reason, just email us at usersupport@fluenz.com and we'll get it sorted out for you, no problem. Hope you enjoy the Fluenz Italian program!

7685,open-ended,B00A3N5W9S,"Do I have to wait for item to arrive to get activation code for iPad, or can I use immediately once I click buy from Amazon? Thx in advance",,"Contact Fluenz and ask them. I think I got the number from Fluenz once the purchase was made and was up and running online even before the CDs arrived. In fact, I never installed the CDs on my computer; I prefer doing it online. I don't remember when I got the number but it did come directly from Fluenz: www.fluenz.com"
7686,open-ended,B00A3N5W9S,can i buy the disc version if i dont have a CD drive in my laptop and just use it online? or do i have to buy the PC download version (more expensive),,You can download the program online. I also have the Cd's but I rarely use the Cd's
7687,open-ended,B00A3N5W9S,Can I use this on iPad/iPhone only or do I need to activate it with a computer initially?,,"I don't for sure. We activated on computer first a couple of years ago when it was still a little clunky on IPad. But, call them, they have always been extremely responsive."
7688,open-ended,B00A3N5W9S,"I was very excited to order this (for my career), but when I got to checkout, it wouldn't let me. Why don't you ship to Canada?",,"Hi Sarah, Sorry for the trouble. I'm not quite sure why it's showing that Amazon won't deliver to Canada.

I now live in NH that has no state income tax, but can purchase any states needed during the program. Excellent program that has always worked flawlessly in the past."
7690,open-ended,B00A42L2HO,I have dividends &amp; interest from mutual funds...that's about it - other than a W2--will H&amp;R Basic let me enter these other income sources?,,Yes. I think the main difference between this and the deluxe is the format of the software. It also do not do state taxes (I am in WA state where there are no state taxes).
7691,yes/no,B00A42L2HO,does this product allow me to do my 2012 taxes right now?,?,"1st be aware that the current taxes being prepared are for the year 2013 and you will need a H&R block home basic 2013 program to file 2013 taxes. If you did not file 2012 taxes and you have the H&R block 2012 program, you should be able to use that program and file right now. Suggest you call H&R Block at 1-800-472-5625 for help on this matter. You will not be able to file 2013 taxes with a 2012 program"
7692,yes/no,B00A42LWHO,Can this be installed on 2 different computers?,Y,Yes I installed the program on both my work and home pc.
7693,open-ended,B00A42LWHO,Is the file that Amazon provides a standard installer or is it a flash installer that loads other installers?,,You download an .exe file that when run will connect to a server to download the actual software (2 files). The 2 files are an .html file that contains your license info. The other file is a self-extracting .exe installation file. Let me know if this answers your question or not. I can supply more details if need be.
7694,open-ended,B00A42LWHO,"Is support for filing for 1 state included in this version, or does an additional fee need to be paid to unlock the 'state' support?",,"1 state comes free with this version. However, if you want to e-file your state, you have to pay extra for that (the federal e-file is free)."
7695,open-ended,B00A42LWHO,I'm always confused if H&amp;R Block At Home 2012 Deluxe + State if good for this year or last.? I am filing for 2012 taxes. The date today is 2/9/2013,,"it's good for tax year 2012. So, if you're filling your taxes for 2012, then H&R Block At Home 2012 Deluxe + State would be the one to use."
7696,yes/no,B00A42LWHO,Does the program transfer all federal info to state?,?,"Federal return info will automatically be transferred to H&R Block's state return form if you buy one of the ""State"" versions, but will charge you extra to file state returns. If you want to file state taxes without paying extra, your options are 1. Print and mail a paper copy of your state return, 2. Go to your state's tax agency web site and see if you qualify for free filing. This usually means falling below a maximum income limit, 3. See if you can manually fill in online forms at your tax agency's web site. In Virginia, for example, I was able to use H&R Block software to calculate and fill in both federal and state return forms. I was then able to copy and paste information from my H&R block form into the state's online forms for free."
7697,open-ended,B00A42LWHO,Can I install this on my home desktop and laptop or am I Iimited to 1 PC installation?,,"I have 2 PCs as well, and usually use it on 1. But I did try to install the CD version on both once before I started buying the downloadable version. Plus the downloadable version, does allow reinstalls, so I would say yes."
7698,yes/no,B00A42LWHO,Will this product file 1099?,N,"Not sure I understand the question. If the question is ""Will this product allow you to include amounts from form 1099 (int, div, etc) the answer is most certainly. If the question is will it prepare the paperwork and form 1099 for amounts that you paid someone else, the answer is NO."
7699,yes/no,B00A42LWHO,Does this come with the free federal efile?,?,"If you look at the image of the product, on the front cover, it says ""Five Free Federal E-Files""."
7700,open-ended,B00A42LWHO,Can I use this program to create my 2012 federal and state income tax returns to PRINT on official forms and MAIL? Or does this apply only to efile?,,Yes. You can print all the forms to sign and mail.

7703,yes/no,B00A42M22S,does the premium version include stock losses??,?,The Premium version includes Schedule D where stock gains and losses are reported. You should be able to copy the stock information directly from the 1099-B (brokers consolidated statement)

After some research I found out to use the Amazon software downloader you have to have Windows on your computer, which Mac users don't have. So that is probably the problem. I've asked Amazon for a refund since Windows was not one of the requirements listed when I purchased the software. I'm still waiting to hear back from Amazon."
7714,yes/no,B00A42LZBC,DO I GET TO E FILE MY STATE FREE ?,?,No. You get the program but then you pay to file it.
7715,yes/no,B00A42LZBC,Can I use this software on my MAC which has MAC OSX Version 10.5.8 as my operating system?,?,"The software requirements are at least Version 10.5, so 10.5.8 is fine."

After you have done the upgrade you need to look in the folder ""WindowsESD"" for the file ""install.esd"" That will create a USB boot or an ISO file which may be burned to a DVD Other wise, if you use the option given, to create media when you use the download file, you will still only have an upgrade version."

7726,open-ended,B00A6TPHZS,xp,,"Upgraded from XP. Went very smoothly. Took about 5 minutes to download 8.0 upgrade, and well less than an hour to upgrade - very easy. There were then a lot of updates to apply (system does them for you, but you may have to tell the system to update immediately rather than waiting for scheduled updates), then I upgraded to Windows 8.1. This took longer, but not too bad - maybe another hour or so. Overall impressed. Old programs are not restored - you have to reload them, but files (documents, pictures, etc) all restored automatically."

Is the Nova Hallmark Card Studio 2013 any better?,?,"Hi Darlene, I can't say that it is better than 2011, however I can say better than 1998 which was the last one I had. I love this one, for me graphics are softer, still vivid, tons of pre made items you can customize and the set up is a bit different for creating your own, I asume they did the most popular templates, I hope this helps ;0), if anything there is I believe a 90 day money back guarantee, won't hurt to see if you love it!"

7779,yes/no,B00ABAW2UA,Does the license allow the installation of a single copy on 3 computers (same user)?,N,No. http://www.earmaster.com/support/frequently-asked-questions.html?view=faq&catid= says: Q. I have a 1-PC/Mac license. On how many computers may I install EarMaster? A. The 1 PC/Mac license entitles you to install EarMaster on both a desktop computer and a laptop.
7780,yes/no,B00ABAW2UA,will this program run on a tablet?,?,"No. It is for PC,Mac users"
7781,open-ended,B00ABAW2UA,what instruments does earmaster 6 cover?,,"ear master should be able to help you ear train with any instrument. The program itself has several instruments to play sounds for. piano, guitar, oboe, brass, etc. if this didn't answer your question or have a certain instrument you want let me know and i will do what i can to help."
7782,open-ended,B00ABAW2UA,"If this product is ordered though the mail, can you download it with a link and cd key or something with what's in the product box? I don't have a disk drive so I would like to know that.",,"Yes, download the product beforehand from the EarMaster's website and use the physical shipment just to get the key. The download has a fully functional trial period so you should be able to use it right away."
7783,open-ended,B00ABAW2UA,What is differences between down loading it and buying CD-Rom box?,,"The download will be long if you are not on dsl or cable. If you are rural like me, you have either 2way satellite or 4G for internet. It will blast your data plan. Also, if download gets interuptted (gee that never happens...) you might have a new temporary hobby trying to get it untangled. With disk, you load it without waiting and it is automatically backed up (so to speak)."

7786,yes/no,B00ABAW2UA,Is this too advanced for a 12 year old,?,I think it depends on the 12 year old. All the exercises start off simply enough and get progressively harder. Some of them could prove difficult. However there are so many options in this program that I think you could find enough to start off with and leave the harder stuff for later. You can't start ear training soon enough if you're serious about music so I'd encourage you to purchase it. Their customer support is pretty fantastic as well.
7787,yes/no,B00ABAW2UA,"Is this a reasonable program to use for a beginner, someone with zero musical training?",Y,Yes
7788,yes/no,B00ABAW2UA,"Does this cover the modulations, and the chord progressions that include the secondary dominants, and the augmented 6th chords?",N,No
7789,open-ended,B00AC90TYG,What about finding proper drivers? Are they readily available?,,In this addition cd all graphic and sound drivers r there
7790,yes/no,B00AC90TYG,will this run as alive cd without overriding win 7,?,"The answer is Mint 14 will launch just fine without damaging the hard drive. Let me explain in more detail. Access your BIOS and make sure boot priority is set to the DVD drive first. That being verified, restart the computer. It will launch the DVD before Windows 7and come up with the Mint14 options screen. The first option ""Boot From Hard Drive"" will work only if you have already used Gparted Partition Manager and placed a Linux partition on your hard drive yourself. It takes a while. Trust me. You cannot forget that. The other options are for 32 bit and 64 bit processors. You must know this before you start if you have a laptop, because the computer could freeze with the battery power on. Hold the power button to turn it off. If this doesn't work you would have to unplug the batter charger and then remove the battery with the laptop on (very undesirable.) For Desktop computers just pull the plug. If the monitor for your computer does not look just perfect in ""Cinnamon"" then reboot and select ""Mate."" In very rare instances of hardware probing on startup, the audio hardware may be set to a default setting which gives you no sound output. Take you mouse and click on menu, slide the pointer to ""Control Center"" and then slide the pointer far down to click on ""Sound."" When the sound window comes up Click the mouse cursor on the ""Hardware"" Tab. In the hardware screen just select different sound hardware detected and then select the ""Test"" speaker buttons. It remembers which hardware you chose last. That should get you up and running in the most difficult and unpredictable situations."
7791,yes/no,B00AC90TYG,"When on computer where Win7 installed on C: drive, after booting up from Linux DVD, is it possible to then mount the C: drive and extract data?",?,I don't think so. its seems you are set up with a dual operating systems you have the choise of booting to windows 7 or linux mint but you vcan not run both operating system at the same time.

7793,open-ended,B00ADQRISI,I see all the problems in 2013 have they been fixed now that it is 2015?,,"It works now with Windows 7. My daughter can use it now. Lots of stuff to do on here. My girl is 7, but gets a little bored on this at times. However, it works."
7794,yes/no,B00ADQRISI,is it compatible with Windows 8?,Y,"I have Windows 8, but had several bugs with it."
7795,yes/no,B00ADQRISI,has anyone installed this on windows vista?,?,I used Windows XP and Windows 7 and neither would work beyond learning the R and V keys. Program would just freeze up ( on two different computers) at the same point. There are clearly bugs in the coding.
7796,open-ended,B00ADQRISI,Can I download this on multiple computers to be used at the same time or would I need a disc for each computer? Have the bugs been worked out?,,I could not down load any copies and I could not get a refund.

7804,yes/no,B00AF2MOKC,Is there a limit to how many images can be in a scrapbook? My grandpa has a TON. He wants to put together all our familys' photos in one digital place,?,I did a family scrapbook depending how big the picture was I was able to fit at least 3 to 4 images on a page. but you can add as many pages to the book you want

7809,yes/no,B00AF2MOKC,Will the program create a .pdf file that I can email to people I want to share the photo book with?,Y,"Yes. There is a ""Share"" section, and you can export the pages as jpegs or pdfs"
7810,open-ended,B00AFI3GDA,Is there a time limit on this screen capture utility? Some utilities has a 10 minute recording limit. Can it compile or render in H264 codec format?,,"No limit on the screen capture as I have capture entire films for later conversion to mp4 and .wav format. However, I don't see that codec format H264... I know it has various presets .avi, .mov., .mp4, .wav, and many others...I sometimes export to WAV and import into Premiere for serious video editing."
7811,open-ended,B00AFI3GDA,What is the difference between the personal and business edition?,,"You should check directly with Movavi website for the ""official"" answer to this question. As far as I personally know, the only differences between the two are cost and type of license - I do not believe there is any actual difference in the software itself - it is just a matter of whether or not you intend to use it for ""personal"" or ""commercial"" purposes. Be aware that Video Suite 12 was just released and is available at introductory prices. Not sure how this will impact pricing on v11 or if v11 will still be available for much longer. Again, I suggest you look at the product matrix comparison charts on the Movavi website for detail about what each product offers (ie; the various programs which collectively make up the video suite). Unless you need ONLY the specific functions of one product within the suite (which are all available separately), you'll save money and be better off buying the suite."

7821,open-ended,B00AFI7MM6,Can you download the Movavi software to more than one computer? How many computers do they allow?,,"I think its just a one computer download, but either way it isn't worth it. The recording is sluggish, it slows down your computer, and is an overall bad software."

7823,yes/no,B00AFI7MM6,"i want to record my tutorial from online, is it possible by this software?",Y,"Absolutely! It's been my experience that if you can see it on your monitor, you can capture it!"
7824,open-ended,B00AFI7MM6,what online video will it download? I am getting a new computer for Christmas. Will I be able to download on a second computer?,,Movavi does not download. It provides you the option to record video on your screen with Audio from your speakers. This gives you an option to capture a video that is not supported by downloading software such as YTD.
7825,yes/no,B00AFI7MM6,does it record voice\,?,"Yes. You can record the speaker to record your computer's sound, or you can record your narration using a microphone."

7834,yes/no,B00AFI6KZ6,"Can I just simply rip DVDs, including those infused with copy protection?",?,It doesn't appear to allow you to break it down like that.

He did the research after a friend told him about it, we love it! We had Norton for a few years and it was okay, but I still had a lot of garbage getting to my computer. This is my second year with NOD32 and it does most of the work for me. It protects my computer and my sons laptop better than any other we've tried. I recommend it to every one I know."

It gives you the updates automatically. Also if you install the ESET version 6, It will ask if you want to upgrade to version 7. I did it, It's free so why not. Some people complain about the download times for the ESET. You must delete your old anti virus software before you install the ESET. It will go a lot quicker that way."

If you do find yourself with a non-genuine version of Windows after performing a hardware upgrade, replacing a failing component, or - in an extreme worst case scenario - upgrading a hardware driver or firmware that causes Windows to think you're using a new component, you'll need to activate Windows again with Microsoft. To re-activate a Windows 7 PC, you'll need to open the Windows Activation tool. To do so, click the Start button, type ""Activate"" into the Start menu, and click the Windows Activation shortcut. Select the ""Show me other ways to activate"" option and go through the wizard, selecting the ""Use the automated phone system"" option. You'll then be given a toll-free number you can dial. If everything goes properly, you'll be given a confirmation ID you can enter into the Windows Activation tool to make Windows genuine again. If the automated system fails, you'll be put on the line with a Microsoft customer service representative. Explain your situation and they'll hopefully allow you to re-active your installed copy of Windows, making it genuine again"
7865,open-ended,B00AM9YXTS,Can you go back to Windows 8 instead of having Windows 8.1? If so can we download with 2 computers instead of 1?,,All I know about 8.1 is that it is an upgrade after you install 8-if you do not want 8.1 don't upgrade. If have done it- not sure how to remove it--I would contact Microsoft. This upgrade program will only work on one computer-has one product key-you would have to buy another product key to install it on another computer.
7866,open-ended,B00AM9YXTS,I want to upgrade from Vista to 8 before 10 comes out. Will this process work for me? And is this a consumer version or a system builder license?,,"This is the more universal version. It lets you upgrade from xp or higher. This is consumer version. At least what we are selling is , We do not know what other sellers have to offer. ."
7867,open-ended,B00AM9YXTS,"where can i buy a ""windows 8"" decal?",,"Hello Ken, Thanks for your itnerest! We found some Windows 8 decals on ""Google shopping"" as low as $9.00. We hope this helps."
7868,open-ended,B00AM9YXTS,I would like to upgrade from win vista home premium 64 bit...any problem.,,"Went in with no problem. But I had to get used to 8, what a different OS. Hope all goes well with your install."
7869,yes/no,B00AM9YXTS,Is this unopened and in the original Microsoft packaging?,Y,"Yes, I ordered two, and both were sealed with the Windows seal, and I was able to install and register them without a problem."
7870,yes/no,B00AM9YXTS,I have four computers and they all need to be upgraded. Is there software I can use for all?,?,"To my knowledge, there is not. You will need to buy a product key for each. Which cost the amount of the software."
7871,open-ended,B00AM9YXTS,"if i buy this [win assistant 8.0 shows ok], I will put in my XP laptop and upgrade... - not fresh install- well about drivers downloaded auto?",,"BACKUP ALL YOUR DATA BEFORE UPGRADING. To make sure your hardware is compatible with windows XP, you should check the windows 8 compatibility program NOT the 8.1 one. Google Download Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant . Some times the hardware may be compatible but the Upgrade may not work right, while reinstalling as new install with the upgrade disc would work on same computer."
7872,yes/no,B00AM9YXTS,will it work for a new built system?,?,"I like this ,but some item not working ,I thing windows 7 better them windows 8"
7873,open-ended,B00ANH074Y,"My 14 yo daughter is a good artist and is interested in computer drawing, cgi and computer animation. Is this a good program to start? Other suggestions?",,"First, your daughter needs a graphics tablet, such as Wacom Bamboo. I think it's called Intuos (not Intuos Pro) now. The smallest and cheapest one would be fine for beginning artists if you have monitor size of 23in and below. Program is not so complex, it's just about the same complexity as other good graphics programs out there. If your daughter is serious about art, settling for less complexity might do more harm than good. This is a good program to start. It's better than Photoshop if you only want to draw/paint. The strong point of this program is creating comic book pages and single page art. It doesn't have animation capabilities. For animation programs, avoid Anime Studio, since that one is overly complicated to use. Easytoon is a good animation program to start. It's free and it's simple. It will help your daughter to focus only on ""traditional animating"". If your daughter is interested in 3d animation, Blender is a good choice. It's free and it's powerful. The community surrounding that program is very helpful too."
7874,open-ended,B00ANH074Y,What is the licensing agreement for this program? Are you allowed to run it on more than one personal computer in the same household?,,Im able to run it on two computers simultaneously. You should have no problem installing it on another machine.

7876,yes/no,B00ANH074Y,I just ordered Manga Studio 5 as a curiosity since it was on sale. I am predominately a Paint tool SAI user. Is the painting quality as good as SAI's?,?,"I would agree with the other comment here, except to add that MS5 has many more features than SAI. Version 5's updated brush engine comes with presets which very closely match SAI's excellent ""watercolor"" and blending tools. MS5 also has things like a wide variety of tones, accepts the direct import of 3D models and has numerous other tools that are similar but more expansive than SAI. To me, I would say that Manga Studio 5 is like SAI/Photoshop, but WITHOUT all the non-art related tools AND high price (of Photoshop). Also, if you are especially interested in producing ""comics"" of ANY kind, consider getting the ""EX"" version, which has MANY tools for page and story management, and is &lt;$90."
7877,open-ended,B00ANH074Y,Is this the full version or an upgrade?,,"This is the full version. However, if you want more features, get Manga Studio 5 EX. That is the complete full version. But this is a downsized full version."

We used it in Uganda and donated the laptops and resources to the school there. They were amazed at the information. They do not have access to the internet in remote areas so these resources are needed there to open the world up for those children. :) Hilary"

7901,open-ended,B00ATRE5H8,Will this run run on Windows XP Home or just XP Pro? Thanks.,,"As far as XP and third party software goes, ""XP is XP is XP"". The only place where XP Home and Pro see a difference is with Office, and some Windows development software.

7902,yes/no,B00ATRE5H8,Can software be installed on more than one computer and receive updates on both cpmputers?,N,No
7903,open-ended,B00ATRE5H8,It is a newer version it might work on windows vista we will have to wait and see?,,works fine on windows vista - small problem is the small print even when you use the larger font - i use a magnifier program which helps a great deal (not windows magnifier) - would be good for world book to have an increase font option much much larger than they have - plus the pictures are too small - i loaded my computer with the entire encyclopedia instead of using the cd - works faster that way - i use it a lot - enjoy
7904,yes/no,B00ATRE5H8,Does it work on Windows 8?,Y,"Yes, it does."

7906,open-ended,B00AY00DA8,what is different between the 3 version of portrait pro 11?,,"The plugin version of Portrait Professional runs within Photoshop so you can retouch an image while you're doing other kinds of editing. For a seamless workflow, this is the best option. There is also a standalone version, which runs as a separate software program. It works just as well as the plugin, but you have to open your image in Portrait Professional and then export it. I've used both methods and strongly recommend the plugin. By ""three versions"" maybe you mean the one that can handle raw files; I haven't tried it, but as long as it can work as a plugin it would be worth a try."
7907,open-ended,B00AY00DA8,How can I put it in cart to buy?,,"Joseph, Does your question apply to buying at Amazon? because when I tried adding PP11 to my cart, it worked fine. I really recommend that you do as I did, and order directly from Anthropics, the software developer. I'm on their mailing list, and regularly receive emails offering discounts if you buy from them.

7910,yes/no,B00AY00DA8,Can you install the program on more than one laptop?,?,I've been able to download PP and install it on two computers. An attempt to install it three times failed.
7911,yes/no,B00AY09WAA,Can this be put on more than 1 computer?,Y,you could e-mail them and ask. Lots of companies understand how people have a desktop and a laptop kind of thing. Easiest way would be to download it on you other computer and type in your existing license number.
7912,yes/no,B00AY09WAA,Is it work well with Photoshop and Light room?,?,"I've used Portrait Professional 10 and 11 with both Lightroom 3,4 and currently 5. Works very well with my workflow when retouching my images. I really don't use it with Photoshop as Lightroom is my base tool from which I start my processing."
7913,open-ended,B00AY09WAA,Will this interface at all with Corel's Paintshop? Or is it stand alone?,,"The answer to your question is ""yes""! The program can be used as a standalone or as a plugin with Corel's Paintshop. There is an explanation of how to add plugins to Paintshop at http://akvis.com/en/graphic-tips/paint-shop-pro-photo-plugins.php. I know it is different software but the process is the same - use the instructions for ""Method 2"" but where it says ""Win 32-bit: C:\Program Files\AKVIS, Win 64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\AKVIS"" substitute the path to your Portrait Pro directory (On my machine Windows 8.1 64 bit the path is ""C:\Program Files\Portrait Professional Studio 64 v11"". Finally as the instructions point out the plugin appears in Paintshop under ""Effects; Plugins; Anthropics; Portrait Professional."
7914,open-ended,B00AY09WAA,"Is Studio 64 v11 less than, equal to, or superior than the Max version of Portrait Professional?",,"It is an earlier version of the program. V12 is the new one. The Max version comes with more automated features like auto sex determination and the ability to edit more pictures with standard settings at one time. I have V11 Studio and it works great, but when I upgrade will get the V12 Max it looks like from what I have read."
7915,open-ended,B00AY09WAA,"Is this just for perfecting the face and skin only or can you ""slim"" body parts such as hips, waist and arms? If so, can someone recommend one?",,Andie. Yes you can use this program to complete the task you ask about. I am still stumbling through all that - - but I have used it for those task. Thks Donnie
7916,yes/no,B00AY09WAA,is this the mac version,?,I received this program on optical media which included both the MAC and the Windows version. It is optimized for 64-bit systems.

7919,yes/no,B00AY1LPF4,Does SSR work with Windows 8 as the operating system?,?,I am running it on Windows 8.1 with no problems.
7920,yes/no,B00AY1LPF4,Is this a fully functional program on the CD without requiring downloads from Symantec to run program?,?,Depends on what you mean. The CD contains all of the components to build a bootable thumb drive or CD for recovery. Once the software is installed backups run automatically as long as the backup media is in place. You still have to build your own recovery boot device using Symantec supplied software.
7921,open-ended,B00AY1LPF4,it will not install. I have called symantec countless times and they will not talk to me without a customer number or non amazon order number.,,The product comes with a license number. This is on a letter-size sheet separate from the installation media. If you go to http://www.symantec.com/en/us/global/licensing/ you can create a Symantec account. Once you can log in to the portal you will be able to register your license. Once licensed you will be eligible for phone support.
7922,yes/no,B00AY1LPF4,is this the 2013 R2 version,N,No it is not and will not activate the trial version of r2.
7923,open-ended,B00AY1LPF4,"Does the license for this product have to be renewed every 12 months, or is it permenantly activiated after you buy it?",,I believe it keeps on running but you lose the ability to get new updates and new virus signatures unless you renew.
7924,yes/no,B00AY1LPF4,"Can this product (SSR) restore images created with the (now depricated) Norton Ghost (Ver 8, 9, 11, &amp; 15)?",Y,"David, I can check weather SSR works with Ghost V12 backup files but V12 isn't on your list. I'm bouncing back and forth between Windows XP and 8 with two different hard drives (HD). The Windows 8 HD has the SSR version and the Windows XP HD has Ghost V12. Right now I'm using Windows XP since I like it better. Maybe in the future when I have to power down my system, I can connect the Windows 8 HD and check SSR out against Ghost V12 backup files if you're interested."

7926,yes/no,B00AZMREAM,There are application differences between the Mac and PC versions; the PC has more. It says PC/ Mac. Would this be the MAC version?,N,"Other's answers are incorrect. This is for the subscription to Office 365 Small Business, and includes a Office Professional license for up to 5 devices (not just one), either PC or Mac, plus tablets and iPad. Once you activate your subscription, you are free to log into the site from any of those devices and download the appropriate software."
7927,open-ended,B00AZMREAM,Is this a single user license that can be installed on up to 5 decices? Or 5 users?,,"It is licensed for a single user, and requires you to sign into microsoft with your microsoft user account credentials when initially opening the first application to validate on each device."
7928,yes/no,B00AZMREAM,My office computers are networked. Can I downed this on the server computer and connect the others at the same time fairly easily? Thanks.,?,It has to be installed on each computer and the users you create can access though each installed computer or on the office website with their login you assign. you can download 1 copy and install from the server to individual computers.
7929,yes/no,B00AZMREAM,"Is this the same Microsoft product that includes 50 GB business-class email service, 1 TB OneDrive storage and team sites?",Y,Yes. It does. Same thing
7930,open-ended,B00AZMREAM,Can this license be used on more than one device simultaneously? Or does it require you to quit on one computer before opening it on another?,,Yes. I have it on several computers.
7931,open-ended,B00AZMREAM,What is the difference between Small Business and Home license?,,"I did not think there was much difference between the two and, for some reason, bought the ""small business"" version. HUGE mistake! msft says you have to have your own domain... everyone in my family has email but we don't have nor want to buy, a domain. msft has given me zero help on this or given me a way to morph my account to a ""home"" account. Basically, I have not yet found a way, if there IS a way, to make '365 available to others in my family."
7932,open-ended,B00AZMREAM,Do the installations need to be all the same user? Can I install it on my work laptop with one email and then my home computer with a different user?,,"Yes! The first purchase of this item will force you to get a Microsoft account (you can use an existing @outlook.com, @live.com, or @live.com, and some will be able to employ @msn.com, etc) or you will have to create one if you want a separate account. You will then be able to select a domain, that service will use for referencing itself, as well as for use with those who do no have a custom domain. It will be in the following syntax: user@selectedsubnet.onmicrosoft.com and SharePoint will run a public website from https://selectedsubnet-public.sharepoint.com. Once the account you will use to administer the service is created, that user, in this case the adminstrator, may install the software on up to 5 different PC/Mac's any combination thereof. BUT they must all be under the username you selected for the administrator. If you want different email addresses, you must purchase additional licenses. BE VERY CAREFUL! Office 365, is not for people who are tech savvy, they must be IT professionals to fully administer this. If that isn't you, then buy the Office 2013 Standalone Suites, which can allow for multiple license situations under different users (don't the mistake of patting yourself on the back on this one, you'll regret it). If you want more than my word for it, go right to Microsoft here: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/business/compare-all-office-365-for-business-plans-FX104051403.aspx Take note that the first row of items is defined as ""Subscription to Office for up to 5 PCs/Macs and 5 Windows tablets/iPads PER USER. Office for iPad includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint."" Can't be much clearer than that, but the answer is yes, they need to all be under the same user. When you install on multiple machines, you will enter whatever user will be utilizing that machine and it will be authenticated against the setup initially performed."
7933,open-ended,B00AZMREAM,"Anybody know if multiple key codes can be applied to my account to renew for multiple years? In other words, does 3 codes = 3 years?",,Yes
7934,open-ended,B00AZMREAM,"Do I have to use this online and store in the cloud, or can I use it like a regular 'ole Microsoft Office package saving directly to my PC?",,Hello. You will have both options.

The only caveat is that 365 is the latest version of Word and you might have to save the document as a previous version.
7947,open-ended,B00B1TEIRU,"After first computer, how do you load to subsequent devices?",,"From the computer you want to install it on go to office.microsoft.com Next step is to sign in. Once signed in, click on the ""My Account"" shortcut (or click on your name on top right corner and an option to access account pops up). You'll see your product, how many installs you have left and a green button that will install 365 to your computer."

Can I still access my files on a computer that has the ""real"" Office installed?",,"This is one of those classic ""it depends"" answers. Office 365 uses the newest file format for office . If your ""real"" office installation (office 2013) can access that new format, the answer is ""yes."" If you opt out you'll also not lose your ability to view those files, just the ability to edit/modify the files. You also can maintain backwards compatibility by doing a ""save as"" and choosing one of the older file formats. If you take that last option, you do lose some of the formatting options that are available in 0ffice 2013/office 365 and apps will indicate that you are using ""compatibility mode."""

7953,open-ended,B00B1TEIRU,Can you edit a doc offline? And re-edit it on a different pc with reg office? Created at home and edit at school is the possible situation?,,I have Office 365 on two PCs and Office 2011 on a Mac and can work on each the same as any other. I didn't download the Mac version from the 365 suite so I'd say that you could do so. All three are always connected to wi-fi but I don't see why editing a file offline wouldn't work.

So burn to a DVD or put on a USB external drive or something so you will have a hard copy of it. What I also did was upgrade to the new version X7. When I upgraded one of the things they offer for a small fee is to mail you a DVD with the program. I paid for it. I feel much better having it here on a DVD. Hope the answer helps.
8029,open-ended,B00BFNCFXG,This software will create blu-ray discs but will it play them?,,I don't know about Blu-ray but the DVD played perfectly.
8030,open-ended,B00BFNCFXG,"How do you get it to recognize a camcorder. Mine works with Skype and MovieMaker, but in X6 the capture for both camcorder and DV are greyed out.",,It has to be a compatible capture device. The key question is what is considered compatible? That I do not know as they refuse to release a compatibility list :( I have ran against the same issue with 1/2 my devices.

I got it on sale at amazon and used rewards points on my credit card so it only cost me about $15. When I do a project I always seem to have alot of stills as well as video, for that reason I make several 3 or 4 minute clips saving them in mp4 format, then I stitch them together. That way if I'm well into the project & decide I want to make a change near the start It's no big deal, just change the one clip. Dave"
8032,open-ended,B00BFNCFXG,I need to import .ctg files,,"The .ctg files are cannon catalog files used by canon cameras. They are not meant to be opened by users, but to be used internally by the camera."
8033,open-ended,B00BFNCFXG,Is x6 32-bit or 64-bit ?,,"Hi Bruce, VideoStudio Pro X6 is compatible with 64-bit PCs, but is a native 32-bit application. The happy news here is that VideoStudio offers very impressive support for multithreading, meaning it can take maximum advantage of your multicore processor--delivering excellent speed and performance. I hope that answers your questions!"
8034,open-ended,B00BFNCFXG,"""Does it do freeze frame? NOT screenshot but the ability to freeze a frame during editing and retain the frozen frame as a clip in the timeline? NOT a capture that exports or saves to somewhere else, but a real freeze frame that stays in the project?",,"Yes - but not the way you want it to - you just clip a bit of a clip off an existing clip - pretty much a single frame clip of .01 second in length. And that's what you are looking for, I think. If you add a photo to your video, it's added as a 3 second clip - all the same frame. And you have to clip it down anyway, to get just one frame."
8035,yes/no,B00BFNCFXG,"In my movie, will I be able to show speeded-up segments, like played at 2X speed?",?,"Yes! While I have not used that feature, the package clearly says ""New! Variable speed controls---speed up or slow down any part of your video."""
8036,open-ended,B00BFNCFXG,"I plan to purchase the downloaded version. When I upgrade And get a new computer in the future, will I be able to transfer This software to my new computer? Or Would it be better to order the cd ROM?",,If you purchase a download it will appear in your account so you can download it again.
8037,open-ended,B00BFNCFXG,What is the best video studio to get with no problems,,"I gave up on it. Despite my powerhouse machine that edits HD and 2k with no issues, this software crashed."

8044,open-ended,B00BFNCFZ4,Does this software rip video from a DVD and then can the video be edited to length and added to other video and is there phone support,,"Yes, it can be used to rip video from many sources, including DVD's, but I use it to edit my own video that I have shot. Yes, it is easy to edit length, along with many other aspects, like color, clarity, speed and many other tweaks just like a good photo editor would and you can add other video, music, voice over, and photos with a nice moveable Picture-in-picture adding option. There is phone support available for an additional charge, but even better there are many YouTube tutorials and Corel training videos with print instructions available, all for free. I used these free videos & tutorials, along with Corel's Facebook link where other Corel Video Suite owners are very helpful with hints and tricks to help you create professional video footage. I recently used my software to create a television commercial to advertise an upcoming community charity drive to help support Wounded Warriors, last year our community donated over $70K to Hope For The Warriors."

8064,yes/no,B00BJ6VMRE,"I used VHStoDVD 5.0 Deluxe to download some old movie clips onto my laptop which has Windows Vista. Everything was fine. However when I tried to watch these movie clips on my desktop that has Windows 8.1, I could only get the sound but no pictures. Do...",?,"I dont currently have windows 8, but it might be the file type of the video. Maybe try converting it to a different file type."
8065,open-ended,B00BJ6VMRE,"All I need besides this software is a RCA to USB adaptor, correct?",,"It is hard to answer this question directly since you are asking if you need something that does not and cannot exist. 'RCA' refers to a type of connector while 'USB' refers to a type of hardware-software interface. What you need is a device that converts audio and video to the USB standard required by VHS to DVD. I use a Honestech VIDBOX and I have always assumed that this was proprietary on the USB-software side although I realize now that I am not sure about this. Anyway, I would not attempt to use this software with anything other than a VIDBOX or some similar device that claims compatibility with the VHS to DVD software."
8066,yes/no,B00BJ6VMRE,Does the resolution of the copy deteriorate as the VHS video length increases?,N,I have not noticed any. Most of mine average about 1:45.
8067,yes/no,B00BJ6VMRE,Can this version write out to .mp4 or is only .wmv supported?,?,It supports mp4 so you can sync or view the video on your iPad or Android tablets. mp4 feature buttons are located on the right-bottom corner via Advanced Mode UI.

8069,yes/no,B00BJ6VMRE,1. Does this mean I need to have a previous version B 4 this will work. 2. Does it take care of copy write issues?,?,You do not have to have a previous version for ver 7 to work.Copyright issues? Don't really understand what you are asking but 1) it will copy copy protected tapes 2) it does not place a copy protect on the disc 3) it does not give a license to copy copyrighted material.

8077,open-ended,B00BKT4RFY,"It came with no instructions, the disc went in, then spit out and I am not sure if it is working, it is on something called parted magic what is that running correctly?",,You need to put cd in you computer then turn it off push the power button then tap the f1 KEY BEFOR THE WINDOWS START is should ask u how you want to boot you computer select the from cd option the computer need to boot from the cd for you to use it

Second, I do not know what 'data' you want to reload and would need more details before I could provide a definite answer. That said, I consider myself an experienced computer user.

8087,yes/no,B00BKWXNDI,this was not in the box. do i need to worry that the license could be blocked in a couple of months?,?,"Hi Loren, in this instance I do not think it matters that there was no box. It might matter if you were purchasing the license from off the shelf of a retail store where others might have come into contact with the license and had an opportunity to copy it. But I think the only way you would experience a licensing issue here would be if your computer is already compromised (aka hacked) before installing/running Kaspersky which would not only jeopardize your newly purchased license but just about everything else on your computer as well. The only other way anyone could get your license would be for the hacker or hackers to try and hack Amazons servers. To put it mildly that is much easier said than done and I think volunteering to walk barefoot across hot coals might be a less painful and shorter (in duration) experience than the fines, jail time, and overall penalties associated with trying to hack Amazon or it's servers. On my system I added Kaspersky Pure 3.0 to a clean fresh install of Windows 7, and then ran a full scan with Kaspersky the moment it finished installing and then updating. I would recommend following that procedure to anyone installing any new Antivirus or internet security suite. I hope this helps! Happy computing! Robert"
8088,yes/no,B00BKWXNDI,Are there any trust issues with this being a Russian product? Especially passwords.,?,It is the best security software I have ever owned
8089,open-ended,B00BKWXNDI,you send me the codes via email?,,"Each Kaspersky has it's own codes. So even if someone sent you the codes they have, Kaspersky servers would read it as already used. I buy the disc for 3 or more computers, and each use is registered as installed seperately for each computer. amazon has the best purchase of Kaspersky, or you can download it from the internet, ( I've never done that). I prefer the security of self install, and the Kaspersky tech will help you for free any time you call the 800 number, there is no limit. Good luck"
8090,open-ended,B00BKWXNDI,"Which is better, Kaspersky PURE or Norton Security?",,"Kaspersky updates more often and allows customization of scanning, and if you are a gamer it is less resource intense. Which means more RAM for you to use."
8091,open-ended,B00BKWXNDI,Is this for two years or one?,,The license in my case was for a year. Seller send me email too stating the correct period for license was not two years.
8092,yes/no,B00BKWXNDI,Does it work for Windows 7,Y,"Yes, but it didn't download right for me it was probably my copy ."

8095,yes/no,B00BKWXNDI,Is there any difference from the download to CD? In case i ever need to restore computer would I have any problem when re-installing download version,N,"Well, I didn't do that yet. I think there shouldn't be any problem re-installing the software on your machine. You just need to remember the product key. For re-installing, you need to download the software on your local machine and re-install the software again whenever you want and then you need enter product key that you have stored somewhere. Once all above steps are done, you are good to use the software again...Hope, this would help."

8101,open-ended,B00BMJ3ZJG,"How does licensing work? For example, can I use my creations in apps or games for monetary purposes?",,"My understanding is, anything you create can be used for anything you want."
8102,yes/no,B00BMJ3ZJG,Can you publish to app stores using MotionArtist?,N,You can but not directly. Motion artist publishes to HTML5 which can then be ported to PhoneGap and then create an iOS or Android app. I haven't done it myself but I don't see why it may not work.
8103,open-ended,B00BMJ3ZJG,Does it do voices? Or just musical background?,,"You can add any wav or MP3 files. As far as text-to-speech, No."

Our program is a lot more than just a traveler's guide, Ouino will teach you a very strong foundation of the Spanish language.

It has great content, but also contains extraneous information that could have been left out and makes it 10 minutes or so too long. Unfortunately, it is sprinkled throughout the video, so you can't avoid or skip it. I think the creators of the video should have their editing team go through and leave out the parts that do not apply to a general audience and provide that separately for training. The video they send is best suited for the Privacy Officer who will be using and editing their materials."
8139,open-ended,B00BR9QCPU,How can I get a table of contents for this Manual to assure it is what I need?,,"Mary, I purchased this from a Business Associate view - it is way more than I need because it set up for a healthcare facility.

8159,yes/no,B00BYII3KQ,Will this work on an Acer Chromebook c720??,?,"You cannot install software on a Chromebook, so that is a major decision you have to make. A Chromebook is a web computer, so you can do many things with it, on the web. Google has a ""Chrome Store"" that has 'apps' you can install inside the Chromebook's web browser, but it's not installed ON the Chromebook. They are more like plug-ins (add-ons) than ""programs"". As for Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 6, if you cannot find satisfaction with it's closest web-based alternative, http://pixlr.com/editor/, then you're best to buy a Windows computer at the best price you can find. I don't know of any other alternatives that would work on a Chromebook, aside from pixlr."

The layers get merged when you export to a particular format like .png or .jpg....at least in my experience so far. It's a really easy to use program, I love it so far with my Intuos Pro!"
8163,open-ended,B00BYII3KQ,Why does download cost twice as much as disc?,,"I just looked it up again and Insee that it's $28 if you have a Prime membership and $59 if you don't. From what I see, that's the same for either a disc or download. I prefer the download for two reasons: 1. The software key and download link are stored for you through Amazon and 2. It's easier to install across multiple platforms. Again, I am seeing the difference in the price if you are a Prime member or not, I don't see anywhere else where it's different. I might not be looking at the same thing you are...."

But do not ask me serial",,There is no serial number because this is a hacked/stolen version of the software. Legal copies of the software haven't been available since May 2011 as a result of the lawsuit by Provo Craft.
8170,open-ended,B00BZY0QYA,How many downloads are included with this? Will disc be sent?,,"There is a disc sent to install the software but there aren't any extra downloads included with this listing for the cartridges.

8174,yes/no,B00BZY0QYA,will this work with windows 8?,?,"Yes, the only thing you need to make sure of is that your Cricuit firmware is 2.43 and below. This firmware is typically found in the older, original Cricuits."
8175,yes/no,B00BZY0QYA,I have the Cricut Expression 2.31. I checked the SureCutsALot site and it said it no longer supports Cricut. Will this still work on mine?,?,"When you turn on your Cricut machine, the display will show which firmware version is currently loaded on your Cricut machine. Sure Cuts A Lot requries version 1.1 or 1.3-1.35 for Cricut Personal machines; version 2.1 or 2.3-2.35 for Cricut Expression/Cake machines; version 1.51-1.54 for Cricut Create/Cake Mini machines. Sure Cuts A Lot version 2 will still work with Cricut machines as long as you don't upgrade the Cricut firmware past its compatible versions. This was a great program but due to a lawsuit by Cricut, Craft Edge was forced to change the compatibly in version 3. I think that was the only real change they made."
8176,open-ended,B00BZY0QYA,"This says it is not for macs, but it has a mac symbol in the picture. Which is it?",,"I have no idea why they put the MAC picture on there. When I looked at the product features, it says, *Compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 (NOT MAC COMPATIBLE)"

If I purchase the download will I have to reinstall the software or can I just enter the serial number.,,"Hello - You should be able to enter the serial number into your current installation as long as it is the same product, AutoCAD 2014 LT. For example, an LT license will not work for the full AutoCAD version."

Second best would be a mouse, specifically one rated for precision. Gaming mice work well. I have never had any good luck drawing with a trackpad on a laptop. They are not very precise."

In some cases I was able to find industry standard symbols which I saved in to a legend template. Those that I couldn't find I created. I also created blocks from these symbols to make it easy to add text, such as circuit IDs, addresses, etc. As I upgraded from 2011 to 2014 the symbols, blocks, and legends went along. I use both the full and LT versions. I am able to move back and forth between them. No problems. Like mine, your industry has loads of symbols too. I suggest you search the web for electrical symbols to save yourself the time it takes to draw them. Good luck. I hope this answer is of some help to you. Cheers~"

It should, If not then just go back to Amazon and redownload it. When I purchased mine back in February, 2014, I was on a 32bit Windows Vista system. I have since bought a new computer, 64 bit that ran Windows 8.0. I just upgraded to 8.1 last week and went back to Amazon.com to re-install my TurboCAD Designer. It downloaded and ran just fine so far. Once you purchase a download software Amazon keeps it on file for you in case you need to re-install and such. So if you do have a problem upgrading to 8.1 just do a clean re-install of your TurboCAD."
8207,open-ended,B00C4YB51I,"Does this use a ""ribbon"" or ribbon like interface comparable to recent MS Office?",,"TC20 uses Tool Bars that can be arranged across the top, down the sides, across the bottom, or at any convenient location on your screen.

The software is still available to me on Amazon for download with the serial number. I purchased it Oct 2013. I use it for design work for my CNC work that I do and the manufacture uses in their online classes. As far as I can tell this Designer 2D is a full working copy and I actually downloaded a trial copy Designer 19 prior to purchasing Designer 20. Good luck...there are a number of videos on this program and the help function gave me what I needed. I have two monitors so I would watch and follow the videos in learning the program."
8210,open-ended,B00C79I0X6,"what video formats will this product convert (I.E. MKV,MP4).",,I have the same question.
8211,open-ended,B00C79I0X6,how many computers can i download this program on and how would i do it,,"The single user license for this program can legally be installed only on one computer. When I purchased it, I saved the installation program to my computer and then installed rather than click run during the download. That way, I have a copy to reinstall should I need to in the future. With your license code, you should be able to download another copy from Wondershare for backup."
8212,open-ended,B00C79I0X6,"this program sucks. I have a video with audio already included, and it won't transfer over the audio.",,I never Checked the Audio until right now when you wrote asking about the Audio I have done hundreds of Movies with this Progam. I don't burn any DVDs with this program if thats what your talking about on the audio I just Convert the files to what I call VOB files ready to be burnt to DVD at a Later Time then I use Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate to Make Movies into HD Format but if I want to burn a DVD I still won't use there program I use Lg DVD Copy Pro to burn DVDs and mine comes out just fine. This is a great program I have to admit to make a File for a DVD to be Burnt to Disc because I have tried other Programs I know this is the best Lg makes 1 click DVD copy and DvD Copy Pro then I burn the DVD from the File I know that the file this Program makes is right as far as sound and Video goes. Maybe it doesn't burn a DVD with sound but I never tried and I never wanted the program to ever do that for me when I went looking for a program like this because like I said I already Use a great program to Burn DVDs and that is LG DVD Copy Pro and this program makes the file right to be burned but I don't use that feature only the file making part. I know to go out to spend another 80 bucks on a great program that only Burns Dvds kinda sucks unless you already had it like I do it's Called LG Software Innovations 1 click Dvd Copy Pro it's the best burning program you can get I only use HP DVD-R Disks I buy off Amazon but after you have that setup of programs you have got everything you need for life.

8219,yes/no,B00C79J0YE,"Can one edit text in existing PDF""s ?",?,"There are several questions about filling in PDFs and every answer says to convert to word. That works, but the questioners may be asking another, more subtle question: can you create FILLABLE PDFS. The answer is yes. You need to enable non protected fields just like macros. Frankly, this works much better on Adobe even though I love Wondershare, but it can be done if you have some programming skill. This is creating a fillable form with the software, not just a read only PDF document. Some computers and browsers won't accept certain formats for fill ins because a common virus uses ""read only"" files to bypass security, but actually contains executable PE's, drivers or .exes embedded in the fill boxes. It can be tricky to disable execution but allow fill ins! IF THIS QUESTION is asking, can you directly access and edit the existing PDF, the answer is it depends on the security settings when you create the document. You can choose it to be editable when you save. If you are asking the tougher question: can you edit a pdf someone previously created as read only, the answer is it depends on the version they used and your skill. One trick is to use control-c after a select all instead of the mouse, as no-copy code often fails with control c but works with the mouse. Another example: with Google books, you only get a ""hand"" on a document and can't even select the text. BUT, if you take a screen shot, then separate the layers in photoshop, you can even copy and edit those. There is always a way, but some take a LOT of skill."

8223,open-ended,B00C7CQ4SG,Who holds the license?,,"I did not register this software. I assume it was already used on someone else's computer. I only needed to load this on one computer (says good for 3), but I did have to call and provide the registration number before it worked. I only conversed with a recording."
8224,yes/no,B00C7CQ4SG,will this work with windows 8.1,?,Yes with no problems. There are three licenses with the enterprise version so you can use on three family or friends computers.

However, I have not been able to download load the program so I can't comment on whether it even works. I hate to spend more money but my only option at this point is to take my computer, and the discs, to a local IT group. :-("
8232,open-ended,B00C7LAQXQ,is this just a licence or a disk as well?,,"This is a 2 DVD disk set, one for 32 bit, one for 64 bit installation. A separate credit-card sized ""Product Key"" is included. Have not had time to install yet. Still running XP!"
8233,open-ended,B00C7LAQXQ,"this is 64bit(this i want) and 32bit, you choose..., correct? this includes DVD-ROM/KEY or only KEY?",,"It includes both 32bit and 64bit - two DVDs and product key. But it is upgrade only - if you currently have 32bit XP or Win7, you cannot change to 64bit."
8234,open-ended,B00C7LAQXQ,this work in a Europe PC with Vista Ultimate?,,I cannot answer this. I installed on PC running Windows 8.1. You should be able to go to the Microsoft website and inquire about Vista application.

8238,yes/no,B00C7LAQXQ,Is this a legal license?,?,"The one I received had a ""legal"" product key... meaning it was accepted by Microsoft when I activated the installation ..."

8240,yes/no,B00CB0WKUA,Is FileCenter Standard 8 compatible with Windows 8.1?,Y,Yes. I have it loaded on that now.
8241,open-ended,B00CB0WKUA,"Does ""FileCenter Standard"" have photo-editing capabilities? If ""yes,"" how do you rate that quality?",,"No, Not that I have found."
8242,yes/no,B00CB0WKUA,Will this work with windows 8?,Y,I don't use windoze 8 but checking the company's site they say it is compatible with Windoze 8.
8243,yes/no,B00CB0WKUA,will the program read paperport *.max files?,N,No
8244,yes/no,B00CB0WKUA,1. Does Filecenter have a print driver that allows you to print any screen to PDF like Paperport's Image Printer?,?,I'm not at my computer but I think it does. If not foxit reader is free and it allows you to view and print any PDF either through its program or the foxit PDF printer driver. File center is an excellent program and I does save files in searchable PDF.
8245,yes/no,B00CB0WKUA,"I have an epson v37. Can't change destination folder, so I'm looking for an alternative scanning software. Will this work for this.",?,"I am using a Brother laser printer, copier, and fax. I have no problem at all scanning to my computer with this softer. I hope this helps. Gene Coombs"
8246,open-ended,B00CB0WKUA,A Duh Question... can you use it to organize files other than PDF? ...like jpg? ...and can you add searchable keywords?,,Yes to both.
8247,yes/no,B00CB0WKUA,does this software know how to handle Brother double side Printer/Scanner?,?,"I use it with a brother printer and scanner that will print on both sides and has a sheet feed scanner. My scanner does not scan double sided documents without reloading, though. So, if your asking if the software can handle double sided scanning, I see no reason that it could not since that is a hardware issue. If your scanner can scan double sided, the information will be sent to document center in that order. I hope that helps. By the way, I think the software is excellent."
8248,yes/no,B00CB0WKUA,do you need multiple licenses to install on multiple computers?,?,"I'm pretty sure buried somewhere in the fine print of that 800 word ""End-User Agreement"" is a single CPU clause, no doubt couple with a web based serial# registration....so I'd say no from a legal/ethical pov"
8249,yes/no,B00CB0WKUA,Will this work on a Mac?,N,I use a pc so I am not sure about Mac. But I do love the program. You might contact the makers of the program at http://www.lucion.com/ Good luck.
8250,open-ended,B00CB0XRV6,"Will this produce do block highlighting like Paperport, or is it limited to recognizable test highlighting like Acrobat?",,"I am sorry, but I cannot specifically answer your question. I have both Paperport Professional 14 File Center. I have my problems with Paperport shutting down sometimes, but have found it much more functional than File Center. I came back to PaperPort after buying and trying File Center."
8251,yes/no,B00CB0XRV6,Can I use this on previously scanned documents that have not gone through OCR?,?,"FileCenter OCR button - under both the manage and edit tabs there is an OCR button next to, but separate from the scan button. Click on a file, then on the OCR button, then click recognize text and you are presented several ways to handle the file OCR output. FileCenter typically creates the scanned image and overlays it with the OCR file if you chose that option when scanning. Using this option, the OCR file is not visible, but is associated with the file you scanned or ran OCR on."
8252,yes/no,B00CB0XRV6,Is this good for Windows Vista and Windows 7?,?,Works for Windows 7. Don't know about Vista.
8253,yes/no,B00CB0XRV6,DOes this work with any scanner?,Y,In all the years I have used the software it has never failed to work with any scanner we had. I would be very surprised if you have a scanner that will not work. If by chance you do have an issue they are great to work with and would never leave you high and dry.
8254,yes/no,B00CB0XRV6,Does this software have a stack and unstack feature for .pdf files?,Y,Yes. You can combine or split PDF files using this software.
8255,open-ended,B00CB0XRV6,What program should I purchase/download in order to be able to edit PDFs?,,You can edit and create PDFs within file center
8256,yes/no,B00CB0XRV6,Does File Center work on Windows 8 and 8.1.?,Y,Yes it works with Windows 8 and 8.1. It's a great program. I use it to scan and organize my life in the cloud.
8257,yes/no,B00CB0XRV6,can i install on 2 computers on do i have two buy twice,?,I installed on 2 computers with one purchase of the downloaded software. I can't remember what the limit was though.
8258,yes/no,B00CB0XRV6,I have a Canon Imagerunner 7095. Canon's Scangear software does not run on Windows 64 bit OS. Will FileCenter work on Windows 64 and a Imagerunner,Y,"I can't say in your exact situation but in order for File Center to work with our HP scanner we were required to load the entire software package from HP. If your Canon software doesn't run on Win 64 then I wouldn't hold out much hope. File Center is finicky when it comes to which drivers it will work with. Honestly, I'm not certain how useful file center is. I can scan docs to a PDF directly from my scanner to a network folder. File Center doesn't really automate anything."
8259,yes/no,B00CB0XRV6,Will FileCenter allow you to erase unwanted marks and paper edges from the scanned document similar to the PaperPort feature?,?,"Yes it does and let me add this application is far and away superior to PaperPort. I cannot be more emphatic about that. FileCenter is a solid, quick, reliable software. PaperPort is none of those."
8260,yes/no,B00CB1Z26I,Does it resize the foreground photo (the face of the subject) to fit the background?,Y,"Yes! You can resize the foreground photo and move it up, down, left, and right. The foreground can be as large or tiny as you like. You can do the same with the background. Everything is adjustable. I'm loving this software."
8261,open-ended,B00CB1Z26I,Can I use a chromakey blue backdrop or does the software only work with the green muslins,,It will work with blue
8262,open-ended,B00CB1Z26I,"When the picture is snapped, what format is it saved in? Can it be saved into a ""hot folder"" as a PNG?",,"PhotoKey 6 can monitor a hot folder for incoming photos from some other application - for example, we use it with Canon's EOS software, which automatically downloads the photos from the camera and stores them into a folder on the computer. PhotoKey 6 monitors that folder, and will display new images as they arrive on the computer. When you are done doing the chroma key, overlay, etc., the output from PhotoKey is a PNG, which you can save wherever you like."
8263,yes/no,B00CB1Z26I,Does the program have language options? Spanish specifically,N,"Hi, sorry, there are no other language options with this product, English only."
8264,open-ended,B00CB1Z26I,will this work with adobe lightroom 3 and do i have to take my photos in front of a green screen,,Yes it works with lr 3 n u have to take pic I front of s green screen
8265,open-ended,B00CB1Z26I,do i have to have cs6 or cs5 in order to use this program. not really looking to spend that kinda money on a new photo shop program when i already have editing software?,,This is a stand alone product. Be sure to have a good key. It definitely helps when it comes time to removing the background and replacing with one of the graphics.
8266,yes/no,B00CB1Z26I,do i have to have adobe cs6 to use this program,Y,Yes
8267,yes/no,B00CB1Z26I,will it work with windows 7,Y,Yes one of my friends is using on his laptop and it's working good
8268,open-ended,B00CB1Z26I,I recieved the package but where do I find the registration key?,,"You have to send an email to sales@tubetape.com. Include your Amazon purchase number, they will send you a registration serial number. There should be a little piece of paper in with your CD that explains this."
8269,open-ended,B00CB1Z26I,The price here is lower than on TubeTape website? Is it legit? Would I be able to install it on 3 computers simultaneously?,,"Hello, that would be correct. You can install on 3 computers as long as they meet system requirements. Tupe Tape is a reseller of our, if you have further questions please direct questions to Tube Tape. Thank you, FXHOME"
8270,yes/no,B00CDIETYK,"I can't install version 10 on a Windows 8 64-bit computer, can I install this version without having version 10 installed in the first place?",Y,Yes. The installation will ask you to insert the version 10 CD to verify that you have it.
8271,yes/no,B00CDIETYK,will this upgrade from naturally speaking?,?,Dragon Medical 9.x and 10.x only I believe.
8272,yes/no,B00CDIETYK,With the medical version; is there a multi-use license available that will allow more than one user to install this software on their PC?,?,"Hi Sheila. With Dragon Medical Practice Edition II, each user would need their own license of the software.

Feel free to contact us at 888-831-0088 for more details."

8274,yes/no,B00CDIETYK,Can I use my Medical 10.1 upgrade program to install this upgrade?,?,"Yes you can use this upgrade, to upgrade from the previous version, if your previous version is 10.1 or higher."
8275,yes/no,B00CDIETYK,my new computer does not have a CD drive. Can I update from my previous Dragon 10.1 w/o a CD drive?,Y,Yes. We can email you a link to download the upgrade.
8276,yes/no,B00CDIETYK,Will I need to enter the key from my current dragon medical 10.1 program to install this new one?,Y,Yes. And it is a bit glitchy during the upgrade. May need to make more than one attempt.
8277,yes/no,B00CDIETYK,can it upgrade from Dragon medical 9,?,"If you possess Dragon Medical 9 or previous, you will need to purchase a full license of Dragon Medical Practice Edition 2. As Nuance certified Dragon Medical resellers we are only allowed to let customers upgrade from two versions back. On the plus side if you purchase from a **certified** reseller you will be provided with support."
8278,yes/no,B00CDIETYK,does it work with windows 8,?,Yes-on my Surface Pro.
8279,open-ended,B00CFRF7UY,"No luck with install. It goes to grub&gt; command line and hangs. Boot command returns ""Kernel must be loaded before booting"". Anyone encounter this?",,"Facts First: The new installation is driven by a program, a program that needs an operating system to execute. So the installation DVD must have the vmlinuz on it (the compressed Linux kernel) and must have the grub (kernel loader). Upon startup, BIOS decides which device has boot program (grub), typically BIOS has a booting sequence (user changable) DVD ; hard disk or perhaps ""pen drive"". Which ever device is present, must have a boot program, if not the device is skipped. If the device has boot program (grub) it must also have vmlinuz for grub to load it. It seems that your device has grub, but not the compressed kernel ""vmlinuz"""
8280,open-ended,B00CFRF7UY,I tried the download version on my xp pc and could not get Ubuntu to run on boot. I'm afraid that the same might happen? Will it auto-run/install?,,"Jonathan, You ""may not"" have enough memory to run ""it"". Seems to me my 4 GB (previously Windows 7) was the minimum it would run on. Try it on ""auto-run/install"" and confirm or not."
8281,yes/no,B00CFRF7UY,Does this operating system run on an older computer currently using Microsoft's Windows XP Professional?,Y,Yes
8282,yes/no,B00CFRF7UY,could I run programs like Netflix using this software?,Y,"Yes just make sure you have Google Chrome as your primary web browser, download it to Chrome and you should be set. Also look into the latest Silverlight program."
8283,yes/no,B00CFRF7UY,does it have C/C++ compilers,?,"try Borlands website,see if they have the finished c/c++,should be free.Or go to Kylix and see if their c/c++ clone is up and running,also free.lastly check the repositories in vdk builder2,another clone project.good luck.try ubuntu forums lots of smart people doing lots of smart stuff."

8289,open-ended,B00CH6ATMO,Difference between Lightroom and Photoshop,,"Lightroom compliments the digital camera and gives you the capabilities of a well equipped wet darkroom. For example: * The camera is set for daylight, Lightroom adjusts the image temperature like using ""indoor"" film for fluorescent lights or studio lights. * You shoot creating ""raw"" and ""jpg"" images, jpg goes right to facebook, raw (which has more information) is used to create that frame-able, award winning print. * You adjust a raw print, Lightroom saves the changes (not the whole image) and the original image. This saves a lot of computer space if you have a dozen variations of the same image. * In the old dark room, you used light (time and intensity) to burn and dodge a print to bring out details in the shadows and washed out feaures. In LR you use your mouse or finger (touch screen). Ditto for tones like sepia and solarization. LR can do pixilation. Try that with an enlarger. * Like the old negative file system. LR stores your `raw' or jpg images in a system of your choice. You can create cross reference list such as ""beach photos"" or ""cute D. coriacea faces"" to find your beach or sea turtle pictures without making copies in different directories. It's like use file cards but without the hassle. Changes are not made to the originals (like you can't change a negative) * Of course you can crop, adjust contrast, color, tone, vignette, control convergence, combination print, make contact(proof) sheets, and most of the wet darkroom techniques. Of course with the full-blown Photoshop you can do all this, but LR is for the photographer and is easier on the wallet. I recommend that you take a LR class from a professional photographer. It will be worth every penny. Also check out some of the articles in Outdoor Photographer http://www.outdoorphotographer.com and in particular the article on how to use lightroom (http://www.outdoorphotographer.com/how-to/photoshop-and-other-software/use-lightroom-like-a-darkroom.html) like a darkroom."
8290,yes/no,B00CH6ATMO,Do I need a the Creative Cloud subscription of $10/month to use this?,N,"The quick answer is no, you do not need the subscription. LightRoom can be a stand alone software that doesn't require the subscription. The $10 subscription is called the photographers bundle and includes Photoshop as well as Lightroom for those that want to do more with their images than LR can like making composites. The subscription also allows for the periodoc updates that occur with software to continually keep everything up to date. It's a good deal if you want PS as well as LR but don't need or want the other programs that are in the creative suite. The creative suite is the only other way to get PS now(it's no longer sold as a stand alone option) and is $50/month or more. With all that info, Adobe has a version of LR that is available for tablets(iPads right now) but that does need to be associated with the subscription."
8291,yes/no,B00CH6ATMO,Is this software complicated to use? I have never used actual photo editing software before,?,"I know the lay out a little bit already after learning some of the Photoshop Elements layout. I haven't found it too complicated and here is the reason. I watched about 20 hrs. of Tutorials on You Tube and adobe TV. Anthony Morganti, Tim Grey, Robert Rodriquez Jr. (make sure it's Jr.) and others I can't remember the name of right this minute. There is a lady on Adobe TV (free too) that goes through the whole program, one thing at a time. B & H puts free tutorials on You Tube to promote sales. I just sat and watched them ""develop"" their pictures and enjoyed it. After awhile I became familiar with the program tools for developing and can do quite a bit with it just from watching other people work. It's a great program. Photoshop will do a lot of stuff that Lightroom won't do and Lightroom does a really good job bringing out the best in your photo's. I would say you probably are going to need both programs eventually. If you shop around you can find Lightroom for around a hundred and Elements for a little less. Both compliment each other nicely. Lightroom was the most important for me and it's not a pixel editor so it is non-destructive to the images. Photoshop Elements will allow you to play with the photo's, copy and past thing form one picture into another, edit badly damaged photo's and a whole lot of stuff. Lightroom allows color manipulation, sharpening, all kinds of enhancements to you pictures. I think it was pretty easy to learn the way I did it. Just watching videos until I understood the basics, then playing with it, then going back and watching specific tutorials on certain things when I need to."
8292,open-ended,B00CH6ATMO,"A stupid question I'm sure, but does this type of software work on scanned non digital photos? Thank you.",,I scanned an interview old photo that was taken in the 50's. I then imported to Lightroom and worked on the picture to clean it up. It worked wonderfully!
8293,open-ended,B00CH6ATMO,THIS Lightroom IS issued as a DVD correct? I Just 'spoke' with Adobe and they are no longer issuing LR as a DVD but as a down load only.,,"I bought Lightroom 5 as a DVD a couple months ago through Amazon. I hadn't heard that Adobe wasn't making them anymore. I have heard that companies want to go to Download only. I kind of like to have the DVD in my hand and if I'm not downloading something I'm not getting stuff I don't want, so far anyway. I just looked up Lightroom 5 on Amazon and I see there are DVD's available for around $110.00. I really like the program. I watched a lot of tutorials on You Tube and Adobe TV that have been a big help and I bought ""Lightroom 5 book for digital photographers"" by Scott Kelby for reference, also from Amazon. I'm happy."
8294,yes/no,B00CH6ATMO,I plan on getting the PC/Mac version. I have a PC and will be going to mac soon and leaving the PC behind. Do I have to purchase a second license?,?,"You may install this installation on 3 machines, though Adobe would have the most accurate information regarding the use of the license."
8295,open-ended,B00CH6ATMO,What are the major editing differences between regular photos and raw photos?,,Regular photos cannot be manipulated much because the camera is doing it for you. Raw format allows you to play with all the colors and contrasts as much a possible
8296,yes/no,B00CH6ATMO,Is there only one PC subscription?,?,You can download install and activate on up to two of your personal computers. The license is cross platform and the serial # or sign-in works for both Mac and Win.
8297,open-ended,B00CH6ATMO,Does anyone out there know of a good book tutorial for Light room 5? I am a first time user coming from Elements 12. Thank you so much.,,"Yes, I have The Adobe Photoshop ""Lightroom5 book for digital photographers by Scott Kelby... the book breaks the software down and leads you through set up and use..."
8298,yes/no,B00CH6ATMO,Will it convert RAW files without the aide of Photoshop?,?,Yes! No problem.
8299,yes/no,B00CH6AWOY,"I have LR 3, can I just buy the upgrade to LR 5?",Y,Yes. All versions of Lightroom qualify for the upgrade to LR 5.
8300,open-ended,B00CH6AWOY,Do I need to uninstall LR3 before installing LR5 upgrade version? Is it cleaner to uninstall LR3 first and install LR5?,,"You are going to like LR5 after using LR3. The prevailing idea in the photo community is to leave the older version on your computer until you have installed LR5. I always leave the ""older"" program on for a week or so after installing the update, unless the directions specifically say to uninstall first or right after installing the new version. Hope this helps"
8301,yes/no,B00CH6AWOY,Does LR5 upgrade work on Win.8. Amazon's description mentions only Win.7.,Y,Yes. I use it all the time on win 8 operating system
8302,yes/no,B00CH6AWOY,Does Amazon offer the Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5 Upgrade for Download PC at the current $75.24 price?,N,No. Only the hard copy (DVD).
8303,yes/no,B00CH6AWOY,"Has anyone ordered this? I have to believe that this is for both MAC and Windows, but the description only says MAC.",?,"I purchased this product on June 16, 2013 betting that it would contain both the PC and the Mac versions... and it does. Hope that helps."
8304,yes/no,B00CH6AWOY,"I have LR 2, is it too old to be upgraded to LR 5 with this? Thanks!",N,"LR2 is exactly what I had and what kept me from upgrading for menu years was the fact that I needed an Intel Mac in order to upgrade. Well, I finally recovered enough from the depression of2009 to buy a new computer and upgrading to LR 5 was one of the main pushing elements to do so. The answer is that LR 2 is not too old to upgrade to LR5, but your computer may be."
8305,yes/no,B00CH6AWOY,is upgade delivered on a cd,?,"Yes, cd is included. You can download from adobe and use the key provided if you do not have a cd drive."
8306,open-ended,B00CH6AWOY,How many computer can I install this on? Is it only 1 license? What If I'm only using it on 1 CPU at a time?,,"Perhaps someone can forward you the precise wording from the license agreement, but it allows me to have one installed on my desktop, and one on my laptop. Since I'm the only one using it, I only use one at a time, and this meets their stated policy."
8307,open-ended,B00CH6AWOY,"Platform lists MAC, but description shows both Windows and MAC. The box has both correct?",,"I purchased this product on June 16, 2013 betting that it would contain both the PC and the Mac versions... and it does. Hope that helps."
8308,open-ended,B00CH6AWOY,Doesn't this include the PC version (dual platform) as well? I didn't think Adobe was making a Mac-only boxed upgrade...,,"I purchased this product on June 16, 2013 betting that it would contain both the PC and the Mac versions... and it does. Hope that helps."
8309,open-ended,B00CH6AXPW,For how many computer i can use it for? i have 3 ... 2 laptops and one desktop and i use them all. what if i buy a new computer can i install it?,,So far I have installed it on 2 different laptops with no difficulty.
8310,yes/no,B00CH6AXPW,Does this include hard copy?,Y,"It has a disc of the software. After purchase you have to ""apply"" for the liscense code. It is easy. Took less than 24hrs. Just had to email them a copy of my school registration. Directions are included."
8311,open-ended,B00CH6AXPW,can this version be used with window 7 or it has to be windows 8,,It's compatable with windows 7 service pack 1. Here is a link to determine your service pack http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/ht/windows-7-service-pack.htm
8312,open-ended,B00CH6AXPW,Is it better to use LightRoom vs special software that comes with a new camera? Any opinion on Panasonic's PHOTOFunSTUDIO &amp; SilkyPix software vs this?,,Lightroom is powerful software that a professional can use yet easy enough for a novice to master the fundamentals. It is a stripped down version of Adobe Photoshop. How much do you shoot? Do you shoot in RAW? If you shoot a lot- the workflow can help you cut time out of post-processing. If you shoot in RAW- it is a must. Best advice is to go to Adobe's Lightroom tutorial section- if you like what the software can do- you should buy it.
8313,yes/no,B00CH6AXPW,is there a different in student and teacher versus regular?,N,I don't think so. The only difference would be the price. If you are a certified teacher or student you will get a better price.
8314,yes/no,B00CH6AXPW,Is there any benefit to purchasing the download edition of the software for $11 more than the hard copy (CD/DVD) besides not waiting for shipping?,?,"I'm a tech, so I ALWAYS get a ""hard"" copy of the software I buy. You never know if something will hiccup and you need to reload your software. It's just a preference I have. Also, one of window's updates thru my Lightroom 5 into a tizzy. When I open the application now I right-click on the desktop icon and click on ""Run as Administrator"". It works....just a heads up! Love the program!!!"
8315,yes/no,B00CH6AXPW,Does the student version come with Bridge and Camera Raw?,?,It is not a plug in. It is part of the program.
8316,yes/no,B00CH6AXPW,I see on Adobe site Lightroom is now version 5.71 and you can download the update. Can that be done with this student version?,Y,Yes.
8317,yes/no,B00CH6AXPW,Is the New York Institute of Photography eligible for the student discount?,N,"Was curious myself. So called Adobe support. an hour later... got them to tell me to google ""NCES global locator"" - then look for NYIP. Basically if it's not on the list - it doesn't qualify for student discount or student versions. I looked for NYIP, New York Institute of Photography, New York (got list - no NYIP), and finally Photography. Again no NYIP. Half price, but if you can't activate it... Off to buy the full version!"
8318,open-ended,B00CH6AXPW,Will this work on Vista or XP?,,"Supported Operating Systems are: -Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 (Not compatible with Vista or older) -Mac OS 10.7 (Lion) or above"
8319,open-ended,B00CHZG1FE,I bought this expecting the full version of the program yet when I open certain plugs (harmor/harmless) say DEMO on them. Why? Disapointed...,,"The Fruity Edition basically just gives you the ability to save your projects. I was kind of in the same boat as you. Although it does come with FL Plugins (Something like that) that don't say DEMO. I kind of like to use FL Keys and FL Slayer personally. So, what it boils down to if you want a certain plugin (that says DEMO) you have to buy it off the Image-Line website."
8320,yes/no,B00CHZG1FE,does this work on the mac?,?,This absolutely does not work on Mac. Read the platforms up top in the description.
8321,yes/no,B00CHZG1FE,Does the price allow me to use this software forever?,Y,Yes.
8322,yes/no,B00CHZG1FE,can you record vocals,?,"Hey, No you can't record vocals with this version, but with creativity you'll still put this to good use. You can still get this version and purchase the vocals software on fl studio though. Hope I helped some."
8323,open-ended,B00CHZG1FE,So is this not a full version?? What exactly can I do with this version of fl studio??,,"Well, it is a full version but has limitations because its the lowest (or cheapest) version you can buy. Many of the plugins that you get with it are only demos to try out. Then if you find a demo you like, you can buy it from the Image Line FL studio website. What I have mostly been doing with this version is going online and looking for loops, pads, side chains, and riffs, and putting them together to make songs. There are limitations with this version, like not being able to drag loops from your library on to the Playlist for instance. The producer edition has no limitations to my knowledge. Well anyways, what I would recommend you do is get this version if you wanna make music but don't know where to start, learn it; then upgrade it to producer edition online on the Image-line Fl Studio Website. You'll save $20-$40. Good Luck and have fun (^_^)"
8324,yes/no,B00CHZG1FE,Do you need a midi keyboard to use this?,N,"No, you do not need a midi keyboard."
8325,yes/no,B00CHZG1FE,can I record audio on this software?,?,"Not with Fruity Edition I don't think, but if you get Fruity Edition you can upgrade to Producer Edition later by buying and using an Fl Extension Box. Producer edition lets you record audio into the program, just make sure your sound card and computer will work with Asio4All drivers. Long story short, it's not the best for recording in my opinion, at least it's never worked for me."
8326,yes/no,B00CHZG1FE,Does this have Free Updates?,Y,Yes
8327,yes/no,B00CHZG1FE,I just need to insert my own drum set and create complete drum tracks output to wav. Is that possible with this version?,?,"Yes, and no?! It would depend on what you are looking to do. If you have an acoustic drum set and you just want to record to wav. file you would be fine just using audacity to do that. If you have a digital drum kit that can output midi data then you can connect it to your computer via an adapter, if it doesn't have a built in USB port to device. The one thing I cannot tell you is how to get fl studio set up to read the midi data as separate channels for your different pieces of your kit. Hope this gives you an idea of what to look at. You might have to youtube and see if anyone shows a how-to on setup for drum kits. Keep in mind too that if you do use midi data you will not get the same sound as your kit unless you buy high quality samples or a vst that matches your kit."
8328,open-ended,B00CHZG1FE,so i cant make instrumentals with this version or record?,,Yes
8329,yes/no,B00CHZG280,can i use this program to record music,Y,Yes
8330,open-ended,B00CHZG280,Does this program come with the Sytrus plugin? or do I need to purchase it later on?,,Hi you need to purchase the Signature Bundle which comes with Sytrus mac
8331,open-ended,B00CHZG280,what is the size of this,,"The size of production possibilities Is close to unmeasurable; the size of the box is about the length and width of a peice of printing paper, the height is about 3 inches, the actual content inside of image line box is a small manual for instruction and the programs cd."
8332,yes/no,B00CHZG280,does this version come with 3xosc (demo or otherwise) because i use it very often in the demo and would love to know.,Y,Yes it does.
8333,open-ended,B00CHZG280,Is it possible to install it on multiple computers? (2 or more) Or would the software not allow you to that because of the registering process?,,You have to uninstall from first computer
8334,open-ended,B00CHZG280,"I'm looking to create soundtrack style songs, and am looking for a large variety of instrumentals. Which is better for this, Fruity or Producer?",,"You can make every type of track with any DAW, it is just a matter of preference, which one you use. If you would like to record your own parts for your track, go for the Producer. The fruity only lets you compose and arrange, no recording. I am a signed producer/remixer and my production is mostly sample-based but every now and then I record guitars, wind intruments, vocals... so the producer version comes in handy."
8335,yes/no,B00CHZG280,is this item easy to use?,Y,Out of the top DAWs (Digital audio workstation) FL is my favorite because it's the easiest to understand in my opinion. And Image Line has toooonnnsss of tutorials on YouTube that can get you started in 10 minutes. I definitely recommend it
8336,open-ended,B00CHZG280,"after i insert the fl studios disk into my laptop, what are the steps to setting it up. Please reply in all steps it would read be thankful :) :)",,what you need to do is read the first few pages of your manual. The manual gives you step by step instructions.
8337,yes/no,B00CHZG280,Will this work with a Mac?,N,No this is for Windows version only
8338,yes/no,B00CHZG280,Could this software be installed on mac?,?,It should be get signature bundle way better
8339,open-ended,B00CHZG2SA,I Know that fl isn't compatible with macs but I have seen people using it on theirs. How is this done so I won't spend 300 for nothing? -Thanks,,FL Studio is still currently in beta for Mac OSX but could possibly be finished by the time FL 12 comes out. Regardless you can download the mac OSX installer off the image-line website. I would suggest trying the demo as its freely available.
8340,yes/no,B00CHZG2SA,do you get future plugins after you buy the 11th edition with the plugins?,Y,"Are you talking about the plugins that come with the bundle or individual plugins that you buy alone? If you're talking about the ones that come with it, then yes, because you have a lifetime free update and you should be able to access all of them. If you're talking individual ones, yes. You can add them to FL when you get them."
8341,open-ended,B00CHZG2SA,Does the Academic edition of fl studio 11 have the same content as this bundle? The descriptions are the exact same?,,"Despite if they are the same, The only thing I guess that academic bundle doesn't give is this (Audio editing and manipulation including pitch correction, pitch shifting, harmonization, time-stretching, beat-detection & slicing, audio warping and standard audio manipulation) &lt;--- that is what the Image Line Softwate Bundel gives you besides the academic one. As long as that description shows :)"
8342,yes/no,B00CHZG2SA,Can this be loaded onto 2 computers? --I have a Windows and a Mac system I would like to utilize the software with.,?,"Here, I hope this help :) http://support.image-line.com/knowledgebase/base.php?ans=72"
8343,yes/no,B00CHZG2SA,Can projects from a later version of Fl Studio (such as 9) be uploaded in this version?,Y,Yes they can
8344,open-ended,B00CHZG2SA,What is the best or good laptop for this software? I've been looking and i couldn't find anything. help me please!!!,,Any laptop will be just find. Ecxept the apple ones. (This is ones my opinion because I does not like thare brand at all) It will depend one which one and what kind of laptop are you looking for. But yeah. I have and Asus republic of gaming and it does the job quite good. :) P.s. I recommend a good high pc or laptop that has the capability to support this kind of program with a good sound card system.
8345,open-ended,B00CHZG2SA,Hello: Does the open box version give you a unique key so you can update the software for free when one is available?,,"Yes it does..... Do not use the cd, the box has a key that gives you the key, and also tells you what to do :) P.s. enjoy.... is worth it :)"
8346,open-ended,B00CHZG2SA,What are the PC requirements for this software?,,"From Image-Line's website (http://image-line.com/flstudio): 2Ghz Intel Pentium 4 / AMD Athlon 64 (or later) compatible CPU with full SSE2 support. The faster your CPU and more cores it has the more you will be able to do simultaneously. Download and test the demo! 32 or 64 Bit versions of Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista, XP (with service pack 3) (or) Intel Mac with Boot Camp / Windows.

ASIO/ASIO2 compatible required for audio recording (FL Studio installs with generic ASIO4ALL drivers)"
8347,open-ended,B00CHZG2SA,i am a rap artist and i will not be useing any tools that does not pertain to my vocals. would me buying this version be unnessesary? if so what version should i get?,,"This is the top of the line edition with all features, some mods, and free lifetime updates. There are other versions with less features, so you may want to take a look at them and decide which one better meets your needs."
8348,open-ended,B00CHZG2SA,so this is whats used to make music? all you need is a laptop right or do you need pianos and stuff like that?,,You do not need anything other than your laptop. The program allows you to use your qwerty keyboard as if piano keys. I would recommend learning the program first and if you are really going to use it alot or if you already play the piano and just cannot stand writing without being able to play on black/white keys then you can fork out additional money. Technically you can make all your music clicking away with only your mouse.
8349,open-ended,B00CLBJSCW,What versions does this upgrade? There is no mention of this.,,upgrades 10 & 11
8350,yes/no,B00CLBJSCW,Can I upgrade from filemaker pro 9 using this upgrade software?,?,It is my understanding that upgrades are only for previous versions. I am fairly sure you can get an answer about this from the Filemaker site.
8351,open-ended,B00CLBJSCW,For Mac Lion?,,Yes and Mavericks too!
8352,open-ended,B00CLFENZK,How do you get it to work? I put it in the CD-Rom and nothing came up? Does it even work?,,"Check to make sure autoplay is on. If not, open the DVD folder and select open then select execute. I did it with autoplay and it nearly all day for it to wipe two hard drives."
8353,open-ended,B00CLFENZK,need to know if it will wipe a apple powerbook g4 laptop (2005) a1138 not intel and a apple g5 powermac desktop a1047 and how do i make it work,,"You have to view the instructions...as I recall, there are some basic steps you have to set up before you get started. I dont know if it works on Apple..ck the specs before purchase."
8354,open-ended,B00CLFENZK,Can i just erase files on the hard disk while leaving the operating system in tact? Can I use this on multiple computers?,,Sorry but no. You will have to reinstall the operating system. But reinstalling is pretty easy.
8355,yes/no,B00CLFENZK,"Once wiped, can I reinstall Windows?",?,of course
8356,open-ended,B00CLFENZK,I want to start fresh on my computer i have trojan will this be helpful then i can reinstall windows and any drivers?,,"I'm sorry but I really don't know. I used Disc Wiper to clean off a hard drive before I gave the computer away. I assumed it cleaned everything off my drive, but I didn't try to reinstall Windows, or anything else. I have the computer away with the original Windows installtion disc. Sorry."
8357,yes/no,B00CNLGPMQ,Is it true that if you cancel your annual contract the software become inoperable? Meaning you can't create new transactions.,N,"You can do transactions as of now, however the payroll and tax tables will not work. I would not recommend Sage for anything. When they were Peachtree they were a good company and a good value. Now it's all about the money. Tech support takes forever and most of the time they don't know what they are talking about and just send you emails that doesn't answer the question. Also the sales team never answers emails, yet they will over charge your credit card but will never return phone calls. Stay away!!!!!!!!"
8358,yes/no,B00CNLGPMQ,Does this work with Windows 8?,Y,Yes
8359,yes/no,B00CNLGPMQ,Does this come with the online training like it does if you purchase it directly from Sage?,?,"If you register as a user, the web based training is there."
8360,yes/no,B00CNLGPMQ,Does the Sage 50 Pro include Basic Job Costing,Y,Yes but I don't use this feature in my business so I can't review it
8361,open-ended,B00CNLGPMQ,How many users is this particular software?,,"This is just for one user. Available or additional users, can be purchased from Sage. Hope this helps. Regards,"
8362,open-ended,B00CNLGPMQ,Why would I get this instead of Quickbooks?,,"I wouldn't. I wish we had stated with quickbooks. The customer service at sage is really bad and they charge over $1,200 per year as a service contract."
8363,open-ended,B00CNLGPMQ,"Does this version support inventory ""kits"" or ""assemblies""",,I do not know the answer to your question. I do not need to use any inventory functions in the work that I do. Sorry
8364,yes/no,B00CO5DKQK,"My windows 7 ultimate will not restart. will this disc repair that? I have no image of previous. no backup. I can go in the back door after about 45 minutes and then it works great. If, however I restart, will not restart.",?,"Didn't do me any good. It only provided the same options already available on my unbootable drive (hard disk check, command prompts, etc.). Much better off to use your windows install disk (if you have it) and choose the repair option."
8365,open-ended,B00CO5DKQK,How do I know if the issue I am having can be fixed with this recovery disc? We have a desktop that is 3 years old. It will not connect with windows.,,"Hi Cynh, Feel free to e-mail us directly through Amazon and let us know your PC issues, specifically, and we can let you know if it will fix it or not. This disk is primarily for BOOT issues and fixes 99% of boot problems and boot errors."
8366,yes/no,B00CO5DKQK,Does this CD fix 'page_fault_in_nonpaged_area' error while I boot up my system,?,"I would Not bank on it. My problem was Not resolved, so I ended up having 2 buy Windows 8 which is a definite yes!! Windows 8 costs $100+"

8369,yes/no,B00CO5DKQK,Hello.. My Laptop got crashed and prompting to use the OS disc for repair. Does this disc solve my problem?

8371,yes/no,B00CO5DKQK,Will this boot the machine without erasing all of my data files? The recovery disk says it will delete all my data when it restores Win 7 (Emachines),N,I don't know. The disk was not useful to me.
8372,yes/no,B00CO5DKQK,Hi. I forgot my password on my account and am locked out of my computer. Will this disk help me?,?,You don't need to buy a disk. I can give you the steps to unlock it for free! Only takes 2 minutes!

8375,open-ended,B00CO9VM3E,how many times i can use software,,All the time.
8376,open-ended,B00CO9VM3E,Can this be installed on more than one PC or is it limited by a number ... If so how many?,,"I checked for myself before I bought it (love it). Simply put, it can only be installed on 1 PC at a time but can be moved around using a license transfer feature. So you're protected and they are protected. They're good folks...smart folks and loyal to their customers."
8377,open-ended,B00CO9VM3E,"I just got this, and it is asking me to pay for it again, what is up with that?!?!?!??????",,I did not have that problem. It has not asked me to pay anything else.
8378,open-ended,B00COJ3BE2,What comes in this box. I received this box which is not sealed and looks used. I am extremely disappointed since it is a Xmas gift.,,"Hi Patti, The box you received should have been sealed. We couldn't find your name in our records, so we're assuming you didn't purchase it from us. Please let us know if that's not the case. Otherwise, most software programs these days don't come with much in the box. I believe the only thing that comes in the Singing Method box is a DVD disc and possibly a card or perhaps a page or two of instructions, but really not all that much. At the same time, the software itself is excellent. Anyway, I hope you end up with a copy of the software that works for you. Let us know if we can help you further. Thanks and happy holidays, Best regards, Arnie Schachere - Music Studio Direct - Amazon"
8379,yes/no,B00COJ3BE2,I downloaded this from Amazon. Some of sounds work like the piano accompanying a song and some don't such as the pitch exercise. Is there a fix?,Y,"I had similar issues with down loads from Amazon.com. I suggest you contact the company. If they are good they will issue you the disk for the program. There address is: www.emediamusic.com eMedia Music Corp. 664 NE Northlake Way Seattle, WA 98105 There phone number is 206-329-5657 I hope this was helpful."

8381,open-ended,B00COJ3BE2,"Do you need to connect a mic to the computer for it to evaluate you? If so, what kind of mic?",,"I have a headset with mic, but any handheld mic that fits your computer's input would work. I have not tried it with my laptop's built in mic. It would probably work but I don't know if it would have the same quality as a plug in."
8382,open-ended,B00COJ3BE2,"I would like to understand the voice input device requirements. Do we need to purchase a USB microphone, or just use the built in microphone.",,"Build in microphone is OK, but you should use Earphones... otherwise program cannot distinguish between you and itself. By the way, the program is great fun to use. I use it every day and I improved a lot... Georg in Germany."
8383,open-ended,B00COJ3BE2,"Is this similar to ""Singing for Dummies"" CD? If not, how is it different?",,"Hi David, Singing for Dummies and eMedia Singing Method draw from the same body of instructional content, but Singing for Dummies contains about half the lessons present in eMedia Singing Method. eMedia Singing Method also includes the Performance Evaluation feature, which will listen to you sing the whole song, give you specific feedback on mistakes, and give you an overall score. This feature is not present in Singing for Dummies. Both Singing for Dummies and eMedia Singing Method include the Interactive Feedback feature, which tells you whether you're in tune, too high or too low in pitch. If you have any questions about eMedia Music software, please contact us at http://www.emediamusic.com/contact/contact_cs.html. Thanks, Sam from eMedia Music Customer Service"

8385,open-ended,B00CS74YQO,What if I already am subscribed through Adobe and wish to go through Amazon instead? Is the customer account data stored by Amazon or Adobe?,,"I just went through this. You can't purchase a subscription from Amazon using the same account your existing Adobe Creative Cloud Subscription is on if it is active. You must purchase a subscription from Amazon using either a new adobe account or a an existing second account that has no creative cloud subscription associated to it. Then contact Adobe and they will cancel your existing subscription. I used chat support, I can't understand phone support at all. There is a caveat here and that is they ask for a 24 character redemption code, the ones that are on the cards you can purchase at resellers. The problem is, Amazon is not using these type of cards so there is no redemption code because you link directly to your account on Adobe through Amazon, it's done behind the scenes. What they had me do was login to my new account and confirm I can see the download buttons and paste in chat my receipt with activation date. Then they canceled my other account without a penalty fee. They will NOT cancel the account first without charging a fee, I would of preferred to have my existing account just switched over to Amazon but they refuse to do this so I now have two accounts. The reason I did this was because I do not trust Adobe any longer with my financial information or credit cards etc... I do use the software quite a bit and it is worth it to me to have access to this subscription I just trust Amazon more than Adobe. You have to have an Adobe account to purchase this, if you don't have one they force you to create one before being allowed to purchase. Contact information is at Adobe but Amazon would be the one that charges your card. With the break in at Adobe I would change my password often and make it something pretty long."
8386,yes/no,B00CS74YQO,"Besides the membership, is there another cost to download the applications?",N,No additional costs. You have access to all the applications and services with your ongoing membership.
8387,open-ended,B00CS74YQO,"Limited plan for downloads. How big are the original downloads? How often and how big are the updates? Assuming 72Mbps, how long?",,"Each app can be downloaded separately, so depending on which apps you need, the download size and time will vary. A list of each apps download size can be found here: http://prodesigntools.com/adobe-cc-direct-download-links.html Estimated download time can be calculated here: https://helpx.stage.adobe.com/x-productkb/global/troubleshoot-download-problems.html#main_Estimated_download_times Hope that helps."
8388,open-ended,B00CS74YQO,If I have a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud must I have Adobe on my computer to have access to all the programs? or is this like Microsoft 365?,,"Hi Dana, I'm not following your question. I think you may be asking if you need to be connected to the internet to use the applications. Creative Cloud is similar to Microsoft 365, in that the desktop applications are installed locally and can be run without an internet connection."
8389,yes/no,B00CS74YQO,is this a single license,?,"This is a subscription license for the entire Adobe Creative suite that is paid/renewed monthly. You may install any of the software on two machines, PC and/or Mac and use the software simultaneously (e.g. Photoshop open on two machines at the same time). You may transfer licenses by revoking the license from another machine through the utility if you need to transfer the license to another (3rd) computer."
8390,open-ended,B00CS74YQO,Is the one month plan a one-off paymet with no subsequent commitments or charges?,,"This is an annual contract paid monthly instead of all at once, if you cancel at anytime before the cotnract is ended then you pay 50% of the remaining years balance. The benefit is that you get access to 90% of Adobe's products, more than the master collection they used to sell and the software is updated with bug fixes, new features on a regular basis. The total price is around $600 give or take a year but you pay monthly instead of all at once. If you do not use the adobe software you want very often then this is a waste of money, if you only use one or two software every few months then I would not go with this program. There are lesser programs by Adobe that only give access to photoshop and a few other common software on a piece by piece monthly rate. I use the software quite a lot as a professional web designer and developer so it is more than worth it for me to pay for this program. If you are a hobbyist that only uses one or two software every so often then I would look at a competitor to see if their software can do what you need where you only pay once. You can still get individual CS6 products for a one time fee at various online and offline retailers. The price for just one software is almost the price of an annual adobe creative cloud membership though but you only have to pay it once. You do NOT get access to updates or new features going that route. You do have access to all versions of the available software in the creative cloud membership going back to CS6 so if you don't like certain 'improvements' you can always role back to an earlier version. I personally like the creative cloud membership but I use the software quite a lot. The updates are worth the price for me, they have been happening product to product on a monthly basis sometimes 2 or 3 times a month a fix gets released or new features added that save me time. You do NOT have to update if you do not want to and you get to select what software gets installed. You can install software on any number of computers, there is no limit to installations, BUT... you can only have two activated at any time. Just logout of creative cloud desktop app on any of the two activated computers and then login to the device you want to use creative cloud with and your good to go. NO need to uninstall or reinstall to deactivate, just login and and out as needed."
8391,open-ended,B00CS74YQO,I want to buy a 12 month membership and pay for all 12 months up front (instead of monthly payments). How do I do that?,,"Amazon doesn't currently offer 3 and 12 month subscriptions, they list as ""Out of Stock"". Adobe does not offer prepaid memberships either. From the Adobe FAQ: ""You can prepay for one year of membership when you purchase through a retailer or etailer (like Amazon)."" Unless there is another online store that sells prepaid memberships, right now we are out of luck. :("
8392,yes/no,B00CS74YQO,I have an Adobe account already and was using free trials of the CC but that's now expired. Would I be able to purchase this and use it?,Y,Yes
8393,open-ended,B00CS74YQO,what happens when my computer breaks?,,"You either repair your computer or get a new one. If you get a new one, download the software from Adobe.com and sign-in to activate it."
8394,yes/no,B00CS74YQO,Can this digital membership (license) be used for business purposes or is it only for personal use?,?,"For both, I used for business purposes."
8395,open-ended,B00CS75KKI,"I wnt to buy CS6, does this give all features? AM I ABLE TO USE IT WHEN IM NOT ONLINE???????",,CS6 will not give all NEW features that come out with the subscription version in the future BUT you only pay for it once. The subscription version is a rip-off because you will pay and pay.
8396,yes/no,B00CS75KKI,"Is Photoshop CC the same as getting the latest version of Photoshop, just as monthly rental, rather than permanent download?",Y,Yes. I would read the Adobe Cc web site for more details as there are caveats.
8397,yes/no,B00CS75KKI,Can I use this in Mexico without internet access?,?,"It warns: Note: Currently, this item is available only to customers located in the United States and who have a U.S. billing address. Also, it's a download so that means you need Internet access to install it and maintain it. With Internet access it shouldn't matter where you are unles they check the country of the IP address from which you're using it. A program called TOR (do a Google search) would let you seem to be in the US no matter where you are."
8398,open-ended,B00CS75KKI,"Will the subscription automatically stop at the one year mark? If not, how do I stop it?",,"As far as I understand it, you have to pay for ever if you want to use it, and lose access if you stop paying. There may be a 'minimum contract time', but sorry I don't know how to stop it, as I didn't want anything to do with the 'perpetual rent but never own' scam. Just stop paying after a year maybe?"

8402,open-ended,B00CS75KKI,I have CS5 and want CC. Should I upgrade my CS5 or is this the complete program already? And can I have CC on two computers and my CS5 on a third?,,CS5 is not the same as CS6 which is not the same as CC ( subscription based month to month). The advantage of CC is that it will likely adapt to the new Win 10 and includes the up-to-date Lightroom program. You cannot just buy CC only rent. Stop paying and you loose the program. CS5 is fine and may not be worth an update to CS6 let alone CC unless there is some special feature you require or plan on a new Win 10 computer in a few months. It is probably best to wait for Win 10 and see what Adobe plans next.
8403,open-ended,B00CS75KKI,I would love to purchase but my concerns are if i would be able to use the 3D ...,,"I don't use 3D myself, but it is in the filters and the edit menus."
8404,yes/no,B00CS75KKI,I have multiple printed old photos. Can I use this software to edit them once I scan them into a file?,?,"Yes, but it is more program than you probably need if you are just doing a few personal photos and will not be scanning to and editing in Tiff formate. Adobe also has their Photoshop Elements which should do quite well for you. Plus I believe you can still buy this one (versus rental method of full Photoshop) for about $150 or less. I bought it packaged with Premiere (video editing) a couple years ago. Have used it as well as an older version of Photoshop to scan and edit old photos. It also opens and edits PSD files"

8415,yes/no,B00CSJFX08,Can you use this to upgrade from Poser 10?,?,This is the full version. You don't need any prior version of Poser. For me it was cheaper than going the upgrade route. You can always point it to your old Poser runtime (Poser 5 in my case) to use your existing content.
8416,open-ended,B00CSJFX08,How many licenses does this Poser Pro 2014 come with?,,"Hello, I believe one; with the provision for one copy for backup-Good-day"
8417,open-ended,B00CSJFX08,"Is this the same full version of Poser Pro 2014 available on the Smith Micro web site, or is this an academic version?",,Full version. Has been very useful for setting up basic figures in 3D environments.

8419,yes/no,B00CSJFX08,I just recived this and it comes with 6 serical numbers. I tried all of them and they are not working. Can someone help?,?,"Is this a upgrade to pro then you need ser numbers to ad to upgrade. If you have the standard or pro full then just follow install with your new cd lic will be on back of cd envelope. Then go to poser site and up date to latest software. Beware that poser is very hard to learn and you will need a lot of extras to really make it work like a pro. I would recomend Daz studio 3D You can do the same as poser and its free and there more sites on learning Daz and extras or cheaper to buy. Hope this works compare Daz 3d and Poser on line at you tube I have them all I like Daz much better easyer to get started and learn.Bob J .St Louis,MO"
8420,open-ended,B00CSJFX08,What is the difference between this and Poser 10? Obviously this is better (judging by the price difference) but does it just include more content?,,"The features are explained on the Smith Micro web site (http://poser.smithmicro.com/comparison.html), but I found the Poser 10/2014 Pro training video by Infinite Skills to be much more helpful. It explains that Poser 10 version is best suited for those who want to use existing materials; the pro is best for those who want to create their own content. In essence, the difference is that Poser 2014 has additional simulation algorithms for sophistocated special effects. It includes a 2nd set of tools for adjusting the face and for adjusting clothes and so on. That's it; the difference is not content or what the program can do overall. So for example as a Poser 10 user I would not be able to custom tailor clothing to a new figure as easily as I could in the Fitting Room in Poser 2014, but I can put clothes on a figure, resize it, fix the poke through, and fine tune the folds if I cared to. In my opinion, both software are powerful, the differences are subtle, and the learning curve is steep. And, my recommendation is to start with Poser 10 and get extensive training and experience on this version. And, when you feel that you would like to have a second set of tools to adjust clothing and to add a layer of additional control dials and adjustments, then upgrade to the Pro version."
8421,yes/no,B00CSJFWUY,Can you make 3d buildings/ cars. Instead of just people,?,"You could build some very simple buildings with the primitives included, but there is an exhaustive supply of buildings, cars, etc available at sites like daz.com, renderosity.com, and RuntimeDNA.com. So many that you will be hiding your wallet before too long ;-)"
8422,open-ended,B00CSJFWUY,Can you draw in or make your own outfits and hairstyles like anime style hair or do you only get what the software comes with?,,"Yes you can, but why would you when the graphics you can buy are so professional and specialised. You are only buying the ""mesh"" which you personalise. So answer is yes, but if you bought Poser why would you not utilise it?"
8423,yes/no,B00CSJFWUY,"Can you import your own original made character models into poser to rig, and animate?",?,"AS far as i can figure out, no, i tried to get a hold of customer service but it was about as difficult to get a hold of the president, no one has answered the phone or emails yet to answer any questions, good luck is about all i can say"
8424,yes/no,B00CSJFWUY,Will this work on a windows 8.1 with a quad core processer and 8 gb of RAM,?,"I currently use Poser 10 on a quad-core, 64bit PC upgraded to Windows 8.1 with 4 GB of ram without issues. Having 8 GB is even better. You shouldn't have any problems installing and running Poser 10 on your PC."
8425,open-ended,B00CSJFWUY,beginning cartoonist- can this software create a bunch of face profiles from one drawing automatically that can be used as charachter sheet guides,,You can create a library of people by taking pictures of the front of the face and the profile of the face.
8426,open-ended,B00CSJFWUY,I'm a total beginner - is there a required 'drawing pad' or something to go with this or do you use a mouse?,,"I haven't spent a lot of time working with this program yet but so far I haven't needed a drawing pad, only a mouse and a keyboard."
8427,open-ended,B00CSJFWUY,"for use simply with posing reference in drawing, how simple is it to get generic poses set up in this version?",,To pose a skeleton the way you want with crude background graphics it'd be under an hour when you first use. To pose dressed woman with a pose and nice rendered background will take hours with a couple references to the manual. Once you get experienced It'll get easier and faster.
8428,yes/no,B00CSJFWUY,Will the Library open on a Windows 8 PC? I tried with a Poser 8 and the Library never opened. I couldn't change the character from male to female.,?,"Hello, as a user of p10 on multiple machines I can tell you there sometimes are issues. On my windows 8.1 machine, my avira antivirus kept the library from opening. Any program or firewall that bocks internet access can cause this issue. Smith micro has an updated patch that helps with many of these issues. Hope this helps."
8429,open-ended,B00CSJFWUY,Is this a full version or an upgrade,,"This is the full version of Poser 10. It comes with a DVD and an install key. Although, if you are looking to upgrade from a previous version, you can do that, but directly from Smith Micro's site. You would need the install key from the previous version to verify the upgrade."
8430,yes/no,B00CSJFWUY,Does this work with Yosemite OS?,Y,"Yes, it does."
8431,open-ended,B00CTTEKJW,I Have Amazon Cloud Player on my PC and would like to have it on my laptop also.,,No problem. Just install the cloud player app. That's the whole point of the cloud. You can access your MP3's from anywhere and from just about anything that can access the web.
8432,open-ended,B00CTTEKJW,My Kindle Fire HDX is giving me a message that says this app is not available on the device. Why is this happening?,,I think it is because you don't need an app on the Kindle to listen to your music. Just go to 'music' and it's all there. Instead download this on your computer to listen to your music from Amazon and other music you've loaded into the Amazon cloud.
8433,yes/no,B00CTTEKJW,do i need an internet connection to use amazon cloud player?,?,If you are using it to download music or play music you've stored in the cloud you will need an internet connection. If you are simply using it as a media player I believe you can use it without an internet connection. To be honest I've found it to be rather bulky and kind've clumsy so I've only used it to download music and then uninstalled the app
8434,yes/no,B00CTTEKJW,can I download this to my laptop,Y,"Yes, I have it downloaded to my Laptop and my Smart Phone. It works pretty good. The only issue I have with the Cloud Player is Album Art. It doesn't show Album Art for all music, even when the Album Art is available."
8435,yes/no,B00CTTEKJW,"I do not believe this is free, as song storage charges usually appear ! Is there a limit to amount of songs that can be stored free ?",?,"The non-subscription version of Amazon's cloud player allows for the storage of a maximum 250 tracks. The paid version allows for up to 250,000 tracks to be stored, for 21.99 per annum. I believe you need an Amazon account to use the free version, & it comes as an automatic extra if you purchase & register a Kindle HD tablet. A nice touch is that if the tracks you are uploading are in the Amazon catalogue at a higher bit rate, they upgrade those tracks at no cost to the customer. The music can be accessed on up to 10 devices. I have around 480 GBs of music, and to store that as data on a hosting site (for back-up purposes) would cost as much per month as the cloud player does a year )"
8436,yes/no,B00CTTEKJW,can you download this music to the music folder on your PC?,?,Yes. Either to Windows media or ITunes. Your choice.
8437,open-ended,B00CTTEKJW,How do I transfer my Cloud playlist to a thumb drive so I can play it in the car? Specificity would help as I am a techno idiot. thanks.,,First if your playlist is mp3 make sure your car will play them. Second what I did was download my list onto my laptop then transfered them to CD's. it may take sometime depending on how many songs you want to download. Cloud should help you step by step to download and your computer music program should offer step by step help to put them on your thumb drive. Hope this helps if you still need help try to find a local computer place to help.

8451,open-ended,B00CY1OE4Q,What are the requirements for the teacher/student edition?,,"For those looking for more details on how the validation process works, I've tried to outline the process here: Notes on EDU validation: If you purchased a boxed product from Amazon, open the box and follow the instructions inside to submit your information for validation. If you purchased a download version from Amazon, the instructions for submitting the product code and validating your student eligibility are contained in a file called ""IMPORTANT - How to validate and activate your product.pdf"" that's included in the download. If you use your school issued email address &lt;yourname@yourschool.edu&gt; from a qualified institution during the process, the validation is instant and no other documentation is needed. If you have to submit documents it may take up to three business days to receive confirmation of your proof of eligibility and your serial number from Adobe. PLEASE READ: You can still install and use the product *immediately* by selecting the 30-Trial option during installation.

8452,open-ended,B00CY1OE4Q,"What happens if I download LR 5 to my current computer now, but I buy a new computer within a year or so?",,"The Adobe license allows you to run on two computers. I run LR 5 on my laptop and my desktop. Photoshop includes a mechanism to deactivate the license on one computer so you can move it to another one, but I don't see an explicit means to do this with LR. However, I have to think you can do this via the LR installation process if you re-install on another computer. Just don't lose your key. You can't be the first person to face this issue."
8453,open-ended,B00CY1OE4Q,"Would I have to re-purchase this each year to continue to use it, or will I continue to be able to use the download on my computer for ever?",,"This is a one-time purchase, not a subscription. I have re-downloaded the installer several times when I reinstalled my computer's operating system and realized I hadn't saved the installer."
8454,open-ended,B00CY1OE4Q,"Just to be clear - this is a stand alone version that does not require the Cloud subscription for full functionality, right?",,I have Lightroom5 and it is independent of PhotoShop
8455,yes/no,B00CY1OE4Q,is there anything different from the Student/Teacher edition than the actual Lightroom 5 sold for $119.99?,?,there is no difference at all. Adobe just authors a discount to students and teachers.
8456,open-ended,B00CY1OE4Q,"I downloaded this product, used it one my computer, but now I have to change computers and I am unable to download this program. How do I fix this?",,Do you have your serial #? You can just download it here: http://www.adobe.com/downloads/updates.html
8457,open-ended,B00CY1OE4Q,I bought this and am trying to dowload it onto my laptop. I have an acer windows 8 and it is not letting me download it.,,consider contacting amazon or adobe customer service for help
8458,open-ended,B00CY1OE4Q,In future will I be able to upgrade student version ?,,"Depends on what you mean by upgrade. Upgrading to a new version of lightroom will not be possible, unless you mean CC or the current version, non-student. The non-Student version is the same as the non-student, so there would be no benefit. Upgrading to CC should be possible, but I doubt that it will change the v5 that is already installed. You may get a discount on the CC subscription, depending on the deals Adobe has running at the time."
8459,open-ended,B00CY1OE4Q,Why are there 2 separate links for PC Downlaod and Mac Download? Can I use PC Download and install the software with same act key on both MAC/PC?,,I would not think so on the student version... because it is for one computer. Because pc and mac act different they have to hane different operating capabilities katy lime any software
8460,yes/no,B00CY1OE4Q,Is there any difference between the student version of LR5 and the standard version of LR5? I am a student but want the full version not some stripped,?,"I am a photographer and have found zero differences! It's just like how Apple offers their educational pricing on items through the website, same concept for this! Amazing deal!!! :)"

8462,open-ended,B00CY1O8DS,I have already downloaded a trial from Adobe. It is LR5 v5.4. Is this the same version? Will the Amazon download re-install and keep what I have already started in the trial version?,,No need to reload. When you buy from amazon you will receive a purchase code or unlock code. When the trial version first opens there dill be an option to input the unlock code. Just enter it and you will be set to go. I did this when I got mine. I had a trial version and bout the license and received the code. I input it and all was well
8463,yes/no,B00CY1O8DS,"I plan to purchase the downloaded version. When I upgrade And get a new computer in the future, will I be able to transfer This software to my new pc?",Y,"Yes you can. Just go to your amazon account, software downloads, and place it on the new computer."
8464,yes/no,B00CY1O8DS,Can you resize pictures so that you can email them easily?,?,"Yes, very easily. Resizing photos is not a problem using Lightroom 5. It gives you a wide range of preset formats and image sizes to choose from. Very versatile and easy to use."
8465,open-ended,B00CY1O8DS,"Is this a full version or an upgrade. I have LR4 but my SSD failed &amp; the replacement did too, so I now have to buy a windows OS &amp; I also have to buy L",,Yes it is a full version.

8468,yes/no,B00CY1O8DS,"can you add text to your photos? i have not seen anyone mention it, nor was it mentioned in the tutorials i watched. thanks in advance.",?,Yes. The watermark/overlay features let you add text and/or graphics to your images.
8469,open-ended,B00CY1O8DS,The current version for lightroom is 5.5 thus if I buy the download version would I get all the upcoming updates as well ?,,Yes. You get notified of and can download updates for version 5.
8470,yes/no,B00CY1O8DS,I have another question I don't have photoshop or Lr. I do have elements 11 find it hard to use. would I be better to go with the monthly lr and Ps.??,?,"Just my opinion.. I think Lr and Ps are fancier and harder to learn, but better designed and handle metadata in a way compatible with other imaging handling applications. So they are more worth learning at the beginning, or you will find yourself, like me, tweaking all your PSE photo metadata when you decide you need that compatibility. As to the monthly payment business, I am getting by with the permanent, non-web version of Lr. (Note that this permanent version does support the much better photo publishing plug-ins as opposed to PSE's share facility which runs through another website, often doesn't work (for me) and doesn't readily support synchronization with the publishing website (e.g. Flickr) of comments from Flickr and photo updates from Lr. Lr is also willing to use my PSE photo editor so I can put off buying the full-up Photoshop editor. For my needs, that is presently quite sufficient and I don't foresee a compatibility blind alley, though I suppose I may be mistaken."

8485,open-ended,B00CY1OB5S,What is the difference between this product and the new Adobe Creative Cloude plan? Is this a stand alone application without a monthly payment?,,"Yes. This is the standalone Lightroom application which you pay for once. I am a photographer and use Lightroom most of the time, even though I have CS6. Creative cloud will be useful if you need the power of Photoshop for image manipulation & creation. Lightroom as a stand alone is more than good enough for image enhancement and localised adjustments."
8486,yes/no,B00CY1OB5S,"Using PhotoshopCS to edit photos.Needs are: adjust expos.,color, contrast ,sharpness,crop;clone;magic eraser;healing brush,etc.Will light room do this",?,"Yes, Lightroom can do all those things.

8501,yes/no,B00D3BK1PW,Will it work on a pc?,Y,yes of course. it's an operating system FOR a PC!
8502,open-ended,B00D3BK1PW,"On a 32-bit Dell XPS 600 with 2 drives in RAID, will Linux install okay? Will it preserve or remove the RAID configuration? Thanks.",,"The answer is probably yes. It will definitely install on a 32-bit Dell XPS 600. I 've had good luck with installing linux based operating systems directly on Dells without having to reconfigure the boot order as you have to do with non-Dell PC's. In terms of RAID configuration, I have no expertise in this area. It probably will preserve the original set-up but I've never encountered this dilemma myself. If you decide to install please let me know how it goes."
8503,yes/no,B00D3BK1PW,Will Linux boot up when I start--Meaning can I get rid of Windows xp,Y,Yes. It is a full standalone operating system that will replace xp. Download the newest version at linuxmint dot com and donate to the project if you like it!
8504,open-ended,B00D3BK1PW,What are the system requirements? Will all of my Steam game work?,,"Yep! Steam supports linux and works great. So far as system req, if you can run steam games you can run linux. Its much leaner than windows. But download the latest version from linuxmint dot com, and make a donation directly to linuxmint foundation. Dont buy this cd sold on amazon here."
8505,yes/no,B00D3BK1PW,"Is this an appropriate version for installation on an iMac 7,1 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo?",Y,"Yes it will work,"
8506,yes/no,B00D3BK1PW,Will this boot from the DVD? I have a laptop but windows xp is corrupted.,Y,"Yes, this can boot from the DVD."
8507,yes/no,B00D3BK1PW,"I have a CD drive instead of a DVD drive on my old Dell Dimension 2400 computer, will it work with a CD drive rather than a DVD drive?",Y,"It should, installation requirements are generally lower that for equivalent Windows operating systems, p.s. Linuxmint 16 (Petra) is available on Amazon for 7 to 10 dollars, even the 64-bit only needs 2GB RAM to run well, and the Petra (16) is so much better than the 15, and 15 is good, but all the ""bugs"" were removed with 16 (Petra) in my experience, run 64-bit instead of 32-bit if you spring for Petra, your computer will run so much better! JT"
8508,open-ended,B00D3BK1PW,I received the Linux Mint disk and when I try to install it on my PC I only get as far as the who are you part and then it won't go any farther.,,"Well, there seems to be a few different ways to install it. I'm A+ certified, but that doesn't mean I know all the answers. I do know that Linux usually installs better on Intel based machines than on AMD processor machines. You may try to use Virtual box (free) or VMWare to run it on an existing Windows PC. There are several choices such as Matte, etc."
8509,yes/no,B00D3BK1PW,Will this work on a Dell Latitude D400?,?,"Should be fine, generally uses less resources than windows"
8510,yes/no,B00D3BK1PW,Will this work on a netbook?,?,"Yes, and no.. Most netbooks do not have an integral DVD drive built into them, so if you wish to use this on a netbook, you'll need to have a USB-connectable DVD drive available and a working USB port in the netbook to connect it through.

How do I use it twice?,,"Hi I had to contact Customer Services, which, at best, is hit and miss and at worst is an appalling experience Beware of their tendancy to try and sell you ""essential clearing of numerous viruses from your infected computer"" I use Windows Defender, CCleaner and Malwarebytes, all free to download, I binned Mcafee Good luck"
8513,yes/no,B00D3CKE2Q,Does it work with Chrome?,?,It does not
8514,yes/no,B00D3CKE2Q,does it have trojan protection,?,"Gwendolyn Good morning Sorry, I don't know. All I do know is that I have removed all traces on Mcafee from my computers and would recommend that you seriously consider another way of protecting yours. I have used Malwarebytes and Windows Defender, both free to download and use, but, with upgrades that cost a little and deliver more than enough to protect my systems Mcafee was, without a doubt, one of the poorer IT decisions I have made and one I would not wish anyone to repeat Good luck John"

8517,yes/no,B00D3CKE2Q,does it locste lost iphones,Y,"Sharon, I've had LiveSafe for about a year and a half and I've never seen reference to using it to find an iPhone. If you've lost your iPhone, you don't need special software. Go to your PC or Laptop, open your Internet browser and go to the site .... https://www.icloud.com/#find .Use your Apple ID and password to sign on and it will find your iPhone for you as long as you had properly set up ""Find my iPhone"" on your phone. Good Luck, John Kerwin"
8518,open-ended,B00D3CKE2Q,"Is this an old version and if purchased I will be prompted to upgrade to the latest version, but still have a full license for a year?",,"I can only assume. If McAfee wants to keep customers, they will upgrade you for free AND you keep your license for your purchase period (one year). I can't answer your question definitively."
8519,open-ended,B00D3CKE2Q,"what year is this for, mine just expired and I don't want the same one..",,"Release Date: July 1, 2013 I got this from Amazon's website for the item."
8520,yes/no,B00D3CKE2Q,does this work on iphones and ipads,Y,"Yes. McAfee has printed on the slipcover that this software can be used on PCs, Macs, smartphones and tablets."
8521,open-ended,B00D7ZFV68,what is a key card,,It's a code for you to download the software. There is no CD in this pack. It does not specifically state that in the description.
8522,yes/no,B00D7ZFV68,Will this work on MAC OS 10.10 (Yosemite)?,?,It would not work on the MAC OS before Yosemite. I have not tried it on this release.
8523,yes/no,B00D7ZFV68,"will it transcribe any voice recordings, i.e. third party or voice memos from iphone?",?,I have an iMac with the latest operating software. The software is Dragon 10.9.4 and Dragon Dictate does not work with this software.
8524,yes/no,B00D7ZFV68,Does it read back?,?,"I do not know what you mean by read back, but my Dictation will not work with the Apple OS version 10.9.2. So if you are up to date with Apple OS, I would not purchase this software."
8525,open-ended,B00D7ZFV68,what does the keycard do?,,A keycard enables you to download the software from the web. It is helpful if you don't have access to a CD/DVD drive.
8526,yes/no,B00D9ACV3W,Is this compatible with Pay Pal so I can add buy now buttons and shopping cart to my site?,Y,"Yes. The shopping cart implementation is quite limited though. If you want a sophisticated online store with databases for customers, inventory, etc., look elsewhere."
8527,open-ended,B00D9ACV3W,"Curious if any users of this software use Consolidated as their ISP. If so, I could use some help in the Session Profile settings during the exporting",,"Your choice of a Web hosting service, rather than an ISP, will determine the Session Profile settings you'll need. All hosting services provide FTP upload addresses, login credentials, and available options."
8528,open-ended,B00D9ACV3W,"In case of hard drive or computer failure, how can you reload this sw? Can one save software on CD? Or just download again from Azomon?",,"If originally ordered thru Amazon, you can access the software on the Amazon website. The software will remain in Your Sorfware Library, where you can download it anytime."
8529,yes/no,B00D9ACV3W,"Can I setup a business email, how many ?",?,"That's a question for your hosting provider. The company you are having your website hosted on. You can go into the control panel for your domain and set up your email accounts. I don't know how many you want/need, but for 99% of the providers, you can do up to 25 email addresses. More might cost extra, check with your hosting providers sales department."
8530,yes/no,B00D9ACV3W,Can I download it on a tablet?,?,Probably not. It would have to be a Windows tablet and even then I'm not sure how well this software would work on a portable device. You might want to try Adobe Creative Cloud if you're looking for cross-platform software for building a website. That's what I'm using now. Hope this helps.
8531,open-ended,B00D9ACV3W,How easy is it to learn? How professional do the websites look? How does it compare to DreamWeaver? Can I import pictures from Photoshop?,,"I bought this product thinking it would be easy to customize. I think that if you just want a stock website it is fine. It has many designs. For me, I hate it and never used it, for someone who just wants to pop in their info and move on, it will probably be fine."
8532,yes/no,B00D9ACV3W,I'm a Game Maker: Studio User. Will I be able to use this to publish HTML5 web games?,?,"All i have found is HTML5 Galleries . I looked through a bunch of templates offered by x5 and other sites created by x5 and have not seen any with HTML5 games. But i could be wrong i would try and contact them. this is from the help in my copy WebSite X5 guide refers to the Evolution v. 10 version.

8533,yes/no,B00D9ACV3W,Do I have to use WebSite X5's hosting package? (I have already paid GoDaddy the hosting fee).,?,"You set up the path to your Web-Site, it does not matter whom you use as long as you have access to the necessary files."
8534,yes/no,B00D9ACV3W,Is it smart phone friendly,N,For smart phone I would recommend X5 Professional not Evolution
8535,open-ended,B00D9ACV3W,Does this program have an HTML code view side that I can add PayPal cart and items code into? If not any way to insert PayPal items another way?,,"Its not hard at all, there is a ""HTML"" add box and a HTML code that can be viewed and edited. This is ""EVOLUTION"" there is a cart built in for a more ""PRO""-ish website. I have had and used this software for over a month now .."
8536,yes/no,B00DFX73OK,"Do all the versions only have a DVD....I don't have a drive to load a DVD. If I use someones ext DVD drive, can I load the program on to my laptop?",Y,"Yes, I can load the program in my laptop. The program work fine. Thank you"
8537,yes/no,B00DFX73OK,Can I install Chess King 3 on a single processor (an Intel Core 2 Quad CPU at 2.40GHz with 3 GB RAM) computer running the Windows Vista OS?,Y,"Yes, it will. Your single processor has 4 cores. One of the big differences between the ""max"" version of CK3 and ""pro"" version is the number of cores it will support. CK3 ""max"" supports up to 6 cores, CK3 ""pro"" supports like up to 32 cores--I didn't bother to look up the actual number, feel free to do that if it matters to you. My system has only 2 cores and I'm running Win 8.1--it works fine. I looked it up for you and Vista is supported. The program will be stronger on your system than it is on mine. Unless you're a GM (grandmaster chess player) or you're into serious analysis (like as a chess programmer or serious tournament player) you should have plenty of power with the ""max"" version. BTW, it's a very nice program, I'm happy with my purchase."
8538,open-ended,B00DFX73OK,Can I set up a position and play the computer from there or are all games set up to start at the beginning?,,No
8539,open-ended,B00DFX73OK,"I see Chess king 1, 2, and 3 on Amazon. I am a begginer (on and off for several years) which version would be best for me?",,"From the Manufacturer: While Chess King 1 will do, I would recommend at least Chess King 2 since it has a new improved interface and new games, and its price is very reasonable. Go for Chess King 3 or 4 only if you need extra speed and power in analysis. One more thing that Chess King 3 does that the previous versions do not: play Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess), since the castling rules are complicated. But for normal use, Chess King 2 is probably absolutely fine."
8540,yes/no,B00DFX73OK,I have a Mac.... does this software only support Windows?,Y,"It only supports Windows normally. However, it is supposed to work on a Mac computer if you have some kind of Windows emulator software. I believe it's call VMWare Fusion and can be downloaded online. People have reported that they have successfully gotten it to work with this Windows-emulator software."
8541,open-ended,B00DFX73OK,"I just bought Chess King 3, but I'm not sure it will install on Windows 8.1. Should I keep or return it?",,It loads and works fine on 5.0. Very good program for a newbie like me and should be good for those more experience. If you have a problem you can have 8.1 run it like and older version of window. Enjoy
8542,yes/no,B00DFX73OK,Can I install the software in several computers ?,?,"I believe you're supposed to be able to install it on 2 or 3 computers. However, there is no guarantee it will install on more than that."
8543,open-ended,B00DFX73OK,How does this compare to Chessbase??,,"Greetings. It compares quite favorably. The database will allow you to do many of the same things you can do with Chessbase. The big advantage Chess King 3 has is that it comes with the currently strongest playing program in the world currently, Houdini 3. It also contains some puzzles/training exercises that can be quite handy."

The answer is YES because when you're using Office 365, you're actually dictating into your documents locally; even though you may be storing them on the cloud. I used DMPE 2 and Office 365 myself although I prefer to store my documents locally because I am apparently old-fashioned"

If the old computer does not work anymore, you need to call customer service and they will free you a license so you are able to installed on a new computer."
8558,open-ended,B00DGCHDBS,which version is for more than one provider to dictate ?,,"As I understand the terms of the licensing agreement, the software allows for one User to have the software installed on up to three machines. Additional Users (there is a registration process & login btw) require additional licenses. I'd suggest calling Nuance sales for more info. This version is crazy expensive because of the medical language libraries included."

8565,open-ended,B00DH3S702,How is this different from something free like CCleaner?,,I believe it is more detailed than CCleaner it gives options to delete files not viewed in a ling time and deletes all files when you uninstall a program. It can also delete original photos that you have modified making more room.

8582,open-ended,B00DHY4TYY,does this produce a watermark? Do you need to be a student to buy/register it?

(This is not necessary if you are using an acoustic guitar). If you are using a PC the Fender Slide works great, or if you are using a MAC / I-Pad the I-Rig also work great.

8635,open-ended,B00DTNJCB8,Will this program allow me to adjust kerning and spacing between lines? How much can the type be manipulated?,,"This is what is on the help index. Have not used it myself... ""Kerning is normally applied where two large, adjacent characters look over- or under-spaced due to the shape of the characters, and is used to reduce or increase the space between the pair of characters. For example, the letters 'A' and 'V' look over-spaced when placed adjacent to each other. Kerning solves this problem by bringing the two letters closer together. To adjust kerning between a letter pair: Using the Pointer Tool, click between the two characters for an insertion point. To increase space (positive kerning), press Alt+Right key. To decrease space (negative kerning), press Alt+Left key. - or - Choose the Kern submenu from the Format menu (or right-click Text Format&gt;Kern). You'll see a submenu to let you adjust the spacing. Choose Custom to enter a kern value specified as a percentage of the text size. Typically the advantages of kerning are only noticeable on larger text, so the most detailed attention is applied to kerning when creating display text: headlines or text logos. As a rule of thumb, you should apply pair-kerning to text over 16 points. You can turn auto pair-kerning on or off, and change the point size above which it is applied. To set the automatic pair kerning: Right-click the text and choose Text Format&gt;Character (or choose Character from the Format menu), then select Character&gt;Spacing. To turn automatic pair kerning on, check the Auto kerning box. Uncheck to turn it off. To change the minimum point size for automatic pair kerning when it is switched on, click the nudge buttons or enter a new value in the Kern Above box. Auto pair kerning will only have an effect on text which uses a TrueType font containing ""pair kerning"" information."
8636,yes/no,B00DTNJCB8,"I want to make good quality poster, mailings and flyers with graphics and photos and text. It needs to be easy to use. Is it?",?,"I haven't done these, but I can say that the instructions for fliers and mailings look very simple, intuitive--unlike their publishing a book instructions. You import your graphics and they have many formats for fliers, in particular. I happened across them while stumbling through. I have the book and its not nearly as helpful as the tutorials- check them out and you will see."
8637,open-ended,B00DTNJCB8,What Graphic types are supported with this software? jpg? wmf? bmp? Raw Camera Images?,,"Hi Louis, PagePlus X7 does NOT support camera raw images. As with most publishing software, I recommend using a photo editing program in tandem. In my case, along with PagePlus, I use Adobe Photoshop Elements 12, which DOES handle camera raw images. So for instance, to design the header for one of my websites, I'll import an image into PagePlus, play around with it, add text, with shadows and manipulate that until satisfied, select everything and export it as an image (usually jpeg) and then resize it in Photoshop Elements. If dealing with raw images, you would first open it with a photo program such as Elements, save it as a tiff or jpeg, and then import it into PagePlus. Getting back to PagePlus export features, if you are planning to print large documents (such as a 36"" x 54"" poster) you should export as a PDF file of any size and let the poster printing software RIP it to the size you want. This is what I do at work with Adobe CC. Usually we export as an EPS file, but as I've indicated, PagePlus doesn't export that. It DOES export as a PDF and that works as well. It is always better to let the poster printer RIP a smaller file (say 1/10th size) than to slow things down with a full-sized poster image. Here, from the Serif website, is what PagePlus can handle: What images and other files can I import and export? Import images: JPG, PNG, TIFF, Adobe Photoshop PSD, SVG, SVGZ, EPS, PS, GIF, J2K, JXR, WDP, HDP, ICO, WMF, EMF, SMF, TGA, DWG, DXF, PCD, PCX, PSP, SPP, RAS, SUN. Professional CMYK, RGB and Greyscale color spaces offered where supported by the image format. Transparency supported. ICC colour profiles supported. Import documents: Fully edit PDFs, plus import Microsoft Word DOC and DOCX, TXT, STT, RTF, WPD, WPS, WRI, ODT documents, and PagePlus publications and templates from PagePlus 7 (released in 2000) onwards. Import data: SDB, ODBC data sources such as Access, SQL and many more, and copy data from spreadsheets including Excel. Import media and interactivity: MP3, AIFF, WAV, AVI, MOV, QT, SWF Flash, FLV Flash video, MPG, MP4, FDF form data, HTML, JS, and embed your own files of any format. Also drag and drop images, text, or other data straight onto your page. Export images: JPG, PNG, TIFF, SVG, BMP, GIF, EMF, WMF, SMF. Export selected objects, selected area, entire page or series of pages. Export at any size/resolution, and super-sample for unrivalled quality. Transparency, changes to color depth and embedding ICC color profiles offered where supported by the image format. Save or export documents: PDF, Web-optimized PDF, PDF/X up to X-3 for professional printing, STT, RTF, TXT, UTX, UTF text files, and PagePlus PPP publications and PPX templates (compatible with PagePlus X3 onwards). Digital publishing: PDF, standard EPUB eBooks and .Mobi eBooks for Kindle including covers, ISBN, copyright and other metadata. PDF publishing capabilities include printable documents, size-optimized for online and email, interactive electronic forms, and interactive publications with media. Also copy and paste content to other programs. Hope this helps."
8638,yes/no,B00DTNJCB8,I have an MS Word document I need to typeset for book printing. Am I able to import it and retain my pre-existing formats?,N,"Other than text filtering, I think the program is only capable of importing PDF, Pageplus and Bookplus files. Pageplus does not have amazing import characteristics."
8639,yes/no,B00DTNJCB8,Does it help to create a logo?,?,If you are experienced with the program. Not easy from a beginners view. More difficult to learn than Publisher
8640,open-ended,B00DTNJCB8,Does this program open Publisher 3.0 files? I know the Publisher 3.0 is just a rebranded version of Serif PagePlus. Is it backward compatible? Thanks.,,I can't answer the question because I am having a very difficult time figuring how to use this software all together!
8641,yes/no,B00DTNJCB8,Is it easy to embed pictures?,?,"Just make sure you have a file picture, then click on ""insert picture"" select from file, use browse to find picture, click open and upload to your page. Size is adjustable either by compression, or moving around on your page to include text wrapping. Good luck. Chris"

8645,yes/no,B00DV5GRMG,"Does this version work with windows 8.1, and will it transfer over projects I used with printmaster 18.1?",N,"You can probably find your answers on the broderbund website. Version 6 is listed as windows 8 compatible, so probably 8.1. Also this statement was on their site, ""Please note: Only PrintMaster versions 2011, 2012, 5.0 and 6.0 can be imported into PrintMaster v6 Platinum. Any other version of Printmaster will not load and import into this new program."""

8647,yes/no,B00DV5GRMG,Are you able to download to more than one computer by purchasing one download?,?,I bought a new computer and was able to....but the computer is registered to me and I have all the same email addresses on the second computer. I do not know about downloading to a computer registered to someone else.....so yes I was able to.
8648,yes/no,B00DV5GRMG,does this printmaster v6 Gold versoin work with windows 7 and 8,Y,"Yes it does, that's why I bought it."
8649,yes/no,B00DV5GRMG,does this product work with windows 8?,?,I am not sure. I would read the specs. I couldn't get it to print.
8650,yes/no,B00DV5GRMG,does this version do business cards?,Y,Yes
8651,open-ended,B00DV5GRMG,how does this compare to older versions. I have older versions and love it but wonder if the format is much different since it got so many bad reviews,,"I like it. It took me awhile to get use to this new version, but once I did I really liked it. I really liked it as soon as I learned how to use the new version."
8652,yes/no,B00DV5GRMG,Can you make business cards,Y,"yes you can make business cards, just about anything you want to make."
8653,open-ended,B00DV5GRMG,"I bought this, downloaded it, got the key, went to ""activate"" and there was no button. I cannot open or operate the program without this.",,I downloaded it too. Could get in but found it impossible to work with. Nothing like my older version. I took it out and am so disappointed with Print Master.
8654,yes/no,B00DV5GRMG,can I import my own images to make business cards and matching postcards? Also are we given a user serial # so If we get a new computor we can re-dow,Y,"Yes, photos can be imported. We are given an activation key. I don't know if it would serve to transfer the program to a new computer. Check on their web site."
8655,yes/no,B00DV5GOGU,does this work with windows 8.1,Y,"Yes, but I don't like it. PrintMaster Platinum version 18 has better features, but won't work with windows 8, so I use my laptop."
8656,yes/no,B00DV5GOGU,Can I save projects as a jpg?,Y,"Yes, but NOTHING is easy. It's a horrible program. The version before this was perfect. With this, I'm constantly frustrated and everything takes me so much longer. Don't buy it!"
8657,yes/no,B00DV5GOGU,can I make posters?,?,"Well, you can make anything on a 8x11 sheet of paper. Anything else bigger, no. It says it can make banners. There is no template for a poster however."
8658,yes/no,B00DV5GOGU,is it vector,?,"I was disappointed that the product has no resemblance to the PrintMaster I have used for years. So I have not used it and have not asked for the 39.xx refund from Amazon, yet. As for Vector--do you mean giving a straight line from chosen point to chosen point? I have no idea, but I've heard of that kind of graphic."
8659,yes/no,B00DV5GOGU,Will PrintMaster v6 Platinum install and run in Windows 7 64-bit?,Y,"I am running PrintMaster V6 Platinum on my Windows 7 64-bit system, so the answer is yes."
8660,open-ended,B00DV5GOGU,Is Printmaster v6 platinum compatible with windows 8.1? I loved Printmaster 15 and 17 - is this one comparable?,,"Yes, it will operate in Windows 8.1. I do not believe it is comparable to the old versions of Printmaster. I own the program and also an older version (which I loved), and the new program is a MAJOR step backwards in my experience. I stopped using it, it is so bad."
8661,yes/no,B00DV5GOGU,Can I have PM 18 and PM v6 installed on same PC?,?,"Sure, they will install as separate programs."
8662,yes/no,B00DV5GOGU,does this work with windows 8.1,?,"I don't know about Windows 8.1, but it is slow and not user friendly on Windows 7. I had a Print Shop program before and that worked a lot better for me."

8664,yes/no,B00DV5GOGU,Is this compatible with WINDOWS 8.1 ??,Y,Yes it is!
8665,open-ended,B00E1L1P5I,What is the main difference between Manga Studio 5 and Manga Studio EX5?,,"Manga Studio 5 (which for previous versions was known as the Debut version) is much cheaper, but has fewer features, while Manga Studio EX 5 has the full range of software features at a higher price. Manga Studio EX 5's main difference from the regular version is the inclusion of story features (organizing comic book pages and files with the story creator) and backwards compatibility with files created in previous versions of Manga Studio. If you don't believe you will be using these features, then it's best to go with the cheaper version. You can see a full list of feature comparisons here: http://manga.smithmicro.com/mangastudio5/#compare"
8666,yes/no,B00E1L1P5I,Can this program be used for digital sketches and cartooning by chance?,?,"Manga Studio EX 5 can be used for digital sketches and cartooning to great resultwith it's highly realistic and customizable pen, pencil, and brush settings. Also, formatting is not an issue as it easily works around most of the major image formats such as BMP, JPG, TIF, TGA, PNG and even specialty file types from Photoshop, Clip Studio and IllustStudio. Choosing to work in a large range of resolutions (from 72-1200 DPI) is easily done as is choosing between working in black and white or color. Another great option is the freedom to move between bitmap and vector based image editing within the same tool. (IE:no more swapping between Photoshop and Illustrator.)"
8667,open-ended,B00E1L1P5I,What are the main improvements of Manga Studio EX 5 to the previous EX version? Is it worth the upgrade?,,"From friends of mine who've had both (and also advised me to purchase this product. The number of upgrades are quite numerous and some of the best ones are subtle (like huge improvements to the interaction of strokes to emulate a real brush/pen feel for example.) From where I am sitting, I would say that it is very much worth the upgrade. In case you're still curious as to what all is actually different, here's a link to a list of what each version has. http://manga.smithmicro.com/comparison.html"
8668,yes/no,B00E1L1P5I,Can I use a Huion H610 Pro Graphics Drawing Tablet with Manga Studios EX 5,?,"I would suspect you can. It seems to work very well with different drivers from different digitizers, so I would guess it will work fine!"
8669,yes/no,B00E1L1P5I,"I use Photoshop on my Mac, but just got a Macbook Pro and was going to using Manga studio on it. Can I go back and forth with same piece of art.",?,"In theory yes. I use Manga Studio, Krita, and GIMP. Between those three, the .psd file conversion has no flaws I've found. The real test is how they handle fonts between the two programs. I have no Photoshop, so I cannot verify if it works or not. Just make sure to save images you want to work on between the programs as .psd and IN THEROY, it should work just fine."
8670,open-ended,B00E1L1P5I,"Is this program something that a very smart (gifted) 9 year old could learn how to use, or is it just too advanced?",,"Absolutely. I'm way behind on the tech myself and find it not only easy but fun and fulfilling. I had and still have difficulty with photoshop, which was originally recommended for me. I was creating with this within 10 minutes after installation and had an idea of what I was doing. You can create digital paintings with ease and if you want, you can create a comic from ground up. Text, word balloons, everything. I love it!"
8671,yes/no,B00E1L1P5I,Can I use Manga Studio EX4 files with this program?,Y,Yes
8672,yes/no,B00E1L1P5I,does it run on windows xp ?,?,Per the System Requirements on the box it does list XP as an OS it runs on. I never tried it on XP however so I can't tell you how well it works.
8673,yes/no,B00E1L1P5I,What is the difference between this Manga Studio EX 5 and just Manga Studio 5. Does EX stand for expert?,?,It's just a more comprehensive version. There are more features in the ex version. I was iffy too until I found out about the 3D poser and perspective features. They are worth the money for the upgrade alone.
8674,yes/no,B00E1L1P5I,does this use vector graphics? i want the freedom to re-size small drawings to larger dimensions without them looking blurry and stretched,?,Manga Studio supports both vector graphics and raster graphics for total flexibility.
8675,yes/no,B00E20V86O,Does this program provide the actual street address of the campground?,Y,Yes
8676,yes/no,B00E20V86O,Does it include information on passes and road elevations?,?,"Sorry, I don't know. I had the program less than 24 hours. On my 2009 version of Trailer Life Campground navigator, I can have it avoid tunnels and advise roadway elevation warnings in percentages."
8677,yes/no,B00E20V86O,"Does it include checking for RV height, like low bridges along the route or avoiding them?",N,"No, low bridge clearance locations are not part of the product. It"
8678,yes/no,B00E3RH37Y,Is this the disc to download yourself,Y,Yes it is the disk.
8679,open-ended,B00E3RH37Y,what does it mean when they say 3 users 1 year,,It means you can install it on 3 different computers at the same time for one year. If it was a single user version you'd have to buy separate ones for each of your computers/laptops.
8680,yes/no,B00E3RH37Y,can i download it,?,Yes you can downloaded it. but be sure your computer is clean of any junk and viruse or spyware before you download it to make sure it not infect when you downloaded it.
8681,yes/no,B00E3RH37Y,Does the registration key you get form purchasing this software from Amazon work for renewing your subscription?,Y,"Yes, if you already have it installed, it will renew the subscription. Just tell the software that you have a new license key."
8682,open-ended,B00E3RH37Y,"Does this come with a full year license, or a temporary one?",,The one I got actually had 3 full-year licenses in it (NOT temporary). I put it on my laptop and my husband's desktop and my son-in-law put it on my granddaughter's laptop.
8683,yes/no,B00E3RH3EW,Can this be used with windows xp?,N,I have had AVG Free for years. I upgraded to full for 3 computers. Bought software from Amazon on line.Would not install after 3-4 days trying. Got several codes. None would work. Asked for money back and got complaint nos each time. Said usually resolved within 3 days. Nothing Happened. No responce ever. FORGET AVG PAID.
8684,yes/no,B00E3RH3EW,Can this product be loaded to the iPad and iPhone ?,?,I think that you need to purchase a mobile specific version.
8685,yes/no,B00E3RH3EW,Does the product have a firewall?,N,No it does not have a firewall but AVG does make and sells firewall software.I hope that answers your question.
8686,yes/no,B00E3RH3HO,does it work with windows 8.1,Y,Yes it works with Win8.1
8687,open-ended,B00E3RH3HO,Did you have to unistall your old antivirus software prior to loading the AVG PC Tuneup and then load the Internet Security 2014 or vice versa?,,"I am using both AVG Internet Security and PC Tune-up. My memory is slow, but I don't think I uninstalled the old software until AVG's was installed and operating. Contact AVG and ask them -- it shouldn't take long to get it in and working. I had a hassle with the Tune up on my wife's computer and AVG helped by controlling her computer and installing it. Helpful folks. (My AVG package allowed installing it on 3 PC's. I got it in 2 laptops, then the problem with Tune up on hers.)"
8688,yes/no,B00E3RH3HO,can you use this on android devices,?,You use avg mobile
8689,open-ended,B00E3RH3HO,"I am looking more for the virus protection, etc. rather than the tune-up concept;better to just get the antivirus software than the internet security software???",,"That's up to you but I don't think so. Anti-virus can be obtained free from Microsoft, but a good firewall has to be purchased. The Microsoft firewall is not very intuitive to those who don't know how to set 'rules' of packet passage. In addition, most of the REALLY dangerous intrusion is not virus but things like inserted software to take control of your laptop ... things like rootkits, remote desktop software, unauthorized tunneling and lurking whenever you log onto the computer. These steal your identity, passwords, and use your CPU power to conduct their own surfing while you surf with what they leave for you to use. They can also store their illegal files on your computer should law enforcement come calling for a pedophile, bank intrusion, corporate secrets or music thieves. I would definitely invest in firewall/malware protection over virus if I couldn't have both. But again, with free Microsoft virus protection, you won't have to have just AVG's internet protection. Others may feel differently, but that's my take on it."

8691,yes/no,B00E5UHRIO,i have kaspersky internet security in my lap... can i use this kaspersky anti virus also,Y,Kaspersky Internet Security is the Anti-Virus with other extras added in.

I my suggestions help you in some way.

8695,open-ended,B00E5UHRIO,If I use this should I use other protection software as well?,,Maybe because kaspersky can't detect everything you know. I would recommend having malwarebytes anti-malware as a back up. Go to malwarebytes.org.

With these types of software an internet connection is generally required for: update of list of current viruses, updates to detection routine, updates to the software, and renewing the license each year. Hope this helps!"
8725,yes/no,B00E5UHRAM,can this work for a windows 8.1 laptop?,Y,"Yes, I am currently running this product on my laptop which is running Windows 8.1."
8726,open-ended,B00E5UHRAM,Please tell how I can un-do all the blocks Google Chrome put on my Kaspersky extensions?,,"I don't have that problem but I can help you. 1-866-328-5700 free Kaspersky help line. Also Kaspersky in the USA 500 Unicorn Park 3rd floor, Woburn, Mass 01801 781-503-1800 Phone or 781-503-1818 FAX I've gotten good answers from the Woburn Office in the past. Hope this helps you."
8727,open-ended,B00E5UHRAM,"After the first year of coverage, what is the annual fee?",,"Frankly, I don't renew. It's cheaper to buy a new license."
8728,yes/no,B00E5UHRAM,"if you activat inus then move to europe,will it work?",?,"Not sure, call them up and asked them... follow this link for contact numbers... http://www.kaspersky.com/about/contactinfo I would think if you own the disk you can use it anywhere...not so sure if you download it from a us website.... call them!"
8729,open-ended,B00E5UHRAM,why only in us not Europe?,,"Kaspersky limits their activation codes by region. If you try to activate a US version license in Europe, it will get blacklisted."
8730,open-ended,B00E6LIEFW,Can i use the quickbooks of one machine to do all the bookkeeping for two or three different companies?,,"Yes, I don't know if there is a limit or not, but you can have at least three different companies"
8731,yes/no,B00E6LIEFW,Can my accountant work with QB Mac files on his PC and return them to my Mac?,N,"Depends on how customized your QB file is. QB Mac can export to QB PC and vice versa. But, everything is not translatable. For example, customized reports will not make the transition. So while all your transactions will remain intact going back and forth, the reports won't. Also, there is a feature to run ""accountant"" copies that might alleviate (or worsen) your situation. Your accountant might be able to answer that one for you."
8732,yes/no,B00E6LIEFW,Could I use the Backup file (.QBB) from my Quickbooks 2006 (Windows) to import my business data to this 2014 version for Mac?,?,"I'm really not sure. Much has changed with QuickBooks Pro between 2006 and the current version. In addition, QuickBooks for Mac does not support all the data fields, functions, and features of the PC version so some things may be missing in the conversion. There are some interesting FAQ's in Intuit's QuickBooks Support website regarding the differences between the two products."
8733,yes/no,B00E6LIEFW,is this a cd,Y,Yes
8734,yes/no,B00E6LIEFW,Can I transfer from Quicken for PC to quick book for Mac,Y,Yes. I did just that with the 2011 version so it should be no problem. I always make a back up before you do it and print out a trial balance so you can make sure all the numbers match.
8735,yes/no,B00E6LIEFW,will this version run on OS 10.6.8?,Y,"Yes this will run on OS 10.6.8. I was running this version in fact, then I upgraded to Mavericks. Both worked perfectly."
8736,yes/no,B00E6LIEFW,Will this work with my iMac on Snow Leopard OS 10.6.8? Thanks,Y,Yes it does on mine but if your account is used to using windows they will be frustrated it is very different.

8742,open-ended,B00E6LIUW4,"What is the difference between QuickBooks Premier Contractor 2014, 2013, 2010? Is there new features or is one just as good as the other.",,"The only thing I know for sure is that if you want to use the payroll add-on service, you have to have one of the three most recent versions, currently 2015, 2014, or 2013. I had 2011 and I was forced to upgrade to 2014 to continue using payroll. It's a little better organized than 2011, but they perform pretty much the same if you don't need the extra services."
8743,yes/no,B00E6LIUW4,can i download this on a desktop and on a pc (both my own) without buying multiple users?,?,I think you will have to pay as a multiple user anyway. I had 3 PC's here and they made me pay as a multiple user. I would call Intuit.
8744,yes/no,B00E6LIUW4,is it compatible with windows 8?,Y,"Yes, if the hardware you are using came with Windows 8, meaning natively installed, versus an upgraded hardware platform."
8745,yes/no,B00E6LIUW4,Is there a Quickbooks Premier Contractor 2014 for the MAC?,?,"I believe so, not sure if amazon.com has the mac version. This program is worth every penny."

Then if you should have a disc crash or other mishap, you can log back on and download the software as many times as you need to as long s your license has not expired.

8770,open-ended,B00E6LIUO2,How many computers will Quickbooks Accountant 2014 allow the software to be loaded on?,,For every license you purchase you can load it onto a desktop and a laptop
8771,yes/no,B00E6LIUO2,"I want to be able to put this on my PC and my laptop, will it let you load it twice?",Y,"Refer to the EULA agreement for an official answer, but my understanding is yes as long as its the same user. QB is sold on a per user license basis and its my understanding that 1 user can install on a desktop and a laptop."
8772,open-ended,B00E6LIUO2,I understand this is one license. If I buy 2 copies then would we be able to work on the same file?,,Make sure both users are accessing the same QB data file in your network and make sure you have switched (under File) to the Multi-Users Mode.
8773,open-ended,B00E6LIUO2,QB for Accountants 2014.....same exact program I would get if I bought from Intuit?,,"Yes. Personally, I bought from Amazon over Intuit directly because I wanted to make sure I got disks, not simply a software download...and it was less expensive. Hope that helps!"
8774,open-ended,B00E6LIUO2,Is this the retail version or the academic version? Is this the version with the CD or the download version? Thank you.,,CD
8775,open-ended,B00E6LIUO2,How many licenses come with it?,,One
8776,yes/no,B00E6LIUO2,Is it a difficult learning curve?,N,"The learning curve is no more difficult than using any version of QB. You can also go to Intuit Academy 2013 and download a free pdf of 62 page manual that will provide all the detail of receiving and sending Accountant file and using the additional features designed for accountants to review client entries, sending JE only, etc. Saves a lot of your time and reduces client errors."
8777,open-ended,B00E6LIUO2,"I would like to get QuickBooks 2014 Accountant with a CD, I do NOT want the download version. How can I make sure I get it with the CD?",,"First, make sure you choose the ""PC"" edition, not ""PC Download."" Under the ""More Buying Choices"" box, click on the link that says ""38 new"" (the number may change). Ability Business has a listing stating ""Brand New with license in the box"" -- this will be a CD with the license."
8778,yes/no,B00E6LIUO2,Is QuickBooks Accountant 2014 the same as QuickBooks Premier Accountant edition 2014 that contains reports for various industries?,?,"yes. you can toggle to another edition. It contains QB premier (general business),contractor, mfg and wholesale, professional services, retail, non-profit, and QB Pro. It does NOT contain QB enterprise."
8779,yes/no,B00E6LIM2W,Does this non-profit software have the abiblity to do payroll?,?,I am not using the software for payroll. I think there is an add-on that does payroll. On the intuit site it looks rather expensive ($300+ per year).
8780,yes/no,B00E6LIM2W,"Never used an accounting software before, just my excel spreadsheets for our small church finances...is this program worth the money?",Y,Yes! QuickBooks non-profit is definitively worth the money. My husband is a pastor and we use it for our church accounting. It has been a wonderful program.
8781,yes/no,B00E6LIM2W,is this program usable for canadian churches?,N,"there's a button that simply says ""I don't know"" but that doesn't answer the question. What are Canadian church non-profit laws? I'm not in Canada so in truth I wouldn't be able to answer. Happy New Year, however."
8782,open-ended,B00E6LIM2W,Is it on a disc or downloadable from the web?,,I ordered it so I would have the disk. I think you can purchase the download from the web if you do not want to have the disk.
8783,yes/no,B00E6LIM2W,I would like to see how the forms /reports look. Can I also move the information from quick books 2011 to the new software? TY Bonnie..Treasurer,?,"Hi Bonnie, You will be able to migrate your 2011 data to the 2014 version. As for seeing what the forms and reports look like, they will not be significantly different from the 2011 version. Intuit does not have a ""trial"" of the Premier software, but you could download the QuickBooks Enterprise 2014 Trial, it is important that you do not use your ""live"" data as once the data is converted to QB Enterprise it will not convert back to Premier. After you download the QB Enterprise Trial, when you install it choose ""Non-Profit"", that will give you an idea on what the reports and forms will look like in the 2014 version. Peter A+ SalesCentral Customer Relations Manager"
8784,yes/no,B00E6LIM2W,Does QB Premier Non Profit have the capability of creating 1099's with the click of a button?,N,QB Premiere for Nonprofits is a marketing version of QB Premiere; essentially no differences except the box and an example company in the setup process. I have not processed 1099s yet but their customer service 800-624-1377 or QB chat feature can answer the process for printing.
8785,yes/no,B00E6LIM2W,"Are there any differences between QuickBooks Premier Nonprofit 2014 and Quick Books Premier 2014, that includes Nonprofit?",Y,"When we bought QB '14 Premier NFP it included all the other choices that came with premier. My guess is that the contents of the box included all that, and that the box may have been the wrong box. I don 't believe you will find any difference once you set up the version that meets your needs. Hope this is satisfactory!"
8786,yes/no,B00E6LIM2W,I do accounting for a nonprofit with a budget of about $1 million and track about 35 restricted funds. Can QuickBook Premier Nonprofit handle this?,?,Absolutely
8787,yes/no,B00E6LIM2W,Will this program work with window 8.1?,Y,"Yes, Quick Books works great with 8.1."
8788,open-ended,B00E6LJAGO,"If you have had a bad experience with Quicken Rental Property Manager, what rental property software did you buy in its place?",,"I didn't have any rental property software prior to buying Quicken Rental Property Manager. Excel is all I used before Quicken. I know I'm not using all the functionality that's available in the application, but so far everything I've used I've been satisfied with."
8789,yes/no,B00E6LJAGO,does the software do depreciation of rental assets for you?,N,"IT is doing it for me, and some assets can be fully depreciated. Important not to fully depreciate items that must be amortized over 27 or so years....it will also depreciate your home office assets...I find."
8790,open-ended,B00E6LJAGO,is this cd or download?,,It is your choice. Download is $85.68 and CD Version (PC) is $76.80.
8791,open-ended,B00E6LJAGO,If I purchase Quicken 2014 should I start with a new computer or can I download on my 8 year old Dell OK?,,There is a bug in 2014 RPM that causes a memory leak after about 20 minutes of use. It will end up using 300+mb of RAM after a while and slow to a crawl. It should run ok if you close and reopen the software every 15 minutes or so.
8792,open-ended,B00E6LJAGO,why R.P.M. Everytime when im using this program get frozen dont let me do anything. let me know ASAP,,I am not a technical support person but I use this on Windows 8 with no problems.
8793,open-ended,B00E6LJAGO,"I bought Rental property manager but when i tray to enter properties info or tenant info the program dont let me do anything, get slow , what can i do",,"What version of Rental Property Manager did you buy? Also, it won't allow you to use the program if you have any other version of rental property manager on your computer. If it the version you bought is ""2014"" and you have no other versions of the same program on your computer, I would call Quicken Customer Support."
8794,yes/no,B00E6LJAGO,Is this software compatible with mobile galaxy III?,N,I have no idea. I have not used mobile galaxy lll
8795,yes/no,B00E6LJAGO,does it work with windows 8 operating system?,Y,"Yes, it does work with windows 8. I have Quicken Rental Property Manager running on my PC with w Windows 8.1."
8796,yes/no,B00E6LJAGO,Can I use the mobile sync to a mac pro?,?,I don't think so unless they make the app for the Mac Pro as well
8797,yes/no,B00E6LJAGO,is there much difference between 2013 &amp; 2014 to make it worth buying?,?,"I upgraded from 2012 and only purchased it because it was on sale for 50% off. Otherwise I would have waited. As for any differences, the only thing I have found so far is the Quicken Cloud and the mobile app."
8798,yes/no,B00E6LIECA,is there an extra cost for payroll,?,"Yes, you have to buy Quickbooks Pro in order to run the payroll and it only covers 1 employee. They used to cover 5 then dropped the count to 3 and this year its only 1 employee. To add more employees it costs per employee every month. That's not the only problem, they take your credit card info and charge it to renew the service without your permission. As many have pointed out its not an easy job to get a straight answer out of them even if you get hold of anyone. They all are good at false promises. Only if they trained their employees that well to help the consumer instead!"
8799,open-ended,B00E6LIECA,i have QB Pro 2011 and a Payroll sub that expires this summer If I buy this will this add a year to the payroll sub? or should I just buy QB Pro 2014,,"Unfortunately, you'll have to buy both because Intuit won't support QB 2011 by this May & your payroll service expires this summer. I hate the way Intuit makes money like that - they set up in a way that you'll have to buy their software every several years."
8800,open-ended,B00E6LIECA,How many computers can this program be install on?,,The software can be installed on multiple computers. The number of users on your license will restrict the number of log ins.
8801,yes/no,B00E6LIECA,Can the QB Pro be used on one machine and the Payroll be used on another with QB 2012?,Y,"As long as your have purchased it for two users, it definitely will work this way"
8802,open-ended,B00E6LIECA,do I have to buy qB every year or is this a one time buy,,I upgrade every three years. My understanding is that product support is only good for three years.
8803,open-ended,B00E6LIECA,I don't need payroll for my business. Do I have to give a credit card number anyway when I register? Also do I need to renew every year ?,,"Hi Peggy, I would not provide the credit card number if I were you. I believe the desktop version is for you to own. You only renew the Payroll Service annually, if you decide to use it. If you are in doubt, call tech support. They'll answer any questions you may have and walk you through. Good Luck!"
8804,open-ended,B00E6LIECA,Any reason I should not get the 2015 instead of 2014?,,"If you need any of the new features they've added for 2015, that would be a reason. http://quickbooks.intuit.com/pro/compare/ Also, since they tend to retire support for a version after 5 years or so, you will most likely be able to get updates from Intuit for a longer period with the new version. That's an issue if you need payroll updates."
8805,open-ended,B00E6LIECA,capabilities of emailing,,I don't use the emailing capabilities. I'm sure it is good. Quickbooks is a great program. I have used it for almost 20 years. There have been many upgrades but this last upgrade is so different and I don't like it.
8806,yes/no,B00E6LIECA,"What if we have 5 employees on payroll, can we use this?",?,We pay ten people. One employee is included. Extra are two dollars per month per employee
8807,open-ended,B00E6LIECA,We have Enhanced Payroll with unlimited employees which is about to expire at the end of the month. Intuit claims there will not be a $2.00 charge if we just let it auto renew. For some reason I don't trust their answer since they could not give me...,,I pay $2.00 per employee. I have not been with them a whole year yet so I'm unsure about renewing.
8808,yes/no,B00E6LIEFM,"I own several computers, can I load this disc on all my computers",Y,Yes. I have it on 3 computers. Each will ask you to register but when you enter your phone number it says it is registered. I've never had a problem.
8809,yes/no,B00E6LIEFM,Can this program be used off line?,Y,Yes We never use it online except to send invoices to our customers. The less time on line I feel the less chance of being hacked.
8810,yes/no,B00E6LIEFM,can I install the download version on 2 of my computers,?,Sorry about that ! You could run install but it will only register on one computer. They nail you over $200.0 for a two computer software.
8811,open-ended,B00E6LIEFM,This product include Disk???,,"Yes, the disk was included."
8812,yes/no,B00E6LIEFM,"We have Windows XP and we are updating from a 2005 version of QB, will this version of QB2014 work for us?",Y,Yes it will I have Windows XP service pack 3
8813,yes/no,B00E6LIEFM,Does this write out checks for you?,?,"Yes, but you will need checks that can be run through your printer. I order mine from Deluxe."
8814,open-ended,B00E6LIEFM,Will disk for 2014 Pro run on Windows 7 or 8? my laptop is windows 8 but my desktop is windows 7. I have 2011 QB now but want to work on my laptop.,,"Yes it will run on both. I previously ran QB Pro 2014 on Windows 7 home Premium 64 bit. Then I started running it on windows 8.1 64bit, so yes it is compatible with both operating systems."
8815,yes/no,B00E6LIEFM,Is there payroll in pro 2014?,?,It is not included in the 2014 QB Pro. It is there but you have to pay Intuit for it then go into the module to activate it. I do not use payroll so I did not purchase it. Hope this helps you.
8816,yes/no,B00E6LIEFM,does this come with a disk? I read 2 answers 1 says yes other says no.can you let me know please,?,I ordered the down load but also ordered the disc as an extra. Lloyd
8817,open-ended,B00E6LIEFM,If you can't do payroll on the 2014 QB then how can it help with doing 1099's 1096 and w2s and w3s ?,,I don't do payroll. Check with QB support or Sales. They will answer your question..
8818,yes/no,B00E6LJ1OA,Can you write checks?,Y,Yes! It does have that capability.
8819,yes/no,B00E6LJ1OA,Will my old quicken basic 1995 edition work safely with windows 8 and 8.1?,?,My 2002 quicken would occasionally locked up Windows 8.1 so I doubt that your 95 edition would work.
8820,yes/no,B00E6LJ1OA,Can I use 2014 Quicken Starter Edition offline?,Y,"yes, I have an account that I put everything in manually"
8821,yes/no,B00E6LJ1OA,Can it be used to track you checking account,Y,"Yes, it is excellent for that. It can be used, essentially, as an electronic check register. If you use the mobile app it makes tracking your accounts extra convenient because you can enter transactions as soon as you make them."
8822,yes/no,B00E6LJ1OA,I would like to to pay bills through Quicken Starter 2014 . Is this possible without using the Billpay feature that costs 9.95 a month?,?,I just use quicken to write checks and balance my checkbook. I know there are many more features but I don't use them so I don't know the answer to your question.
8823,yes/no,B00E6LJ1OA,Can I import and print Data files from quicken 2004?,?,No you cannot. I tried everything in my power and even hired a computer guru. It can only be done if you have the Deluxe version.
8824,yes/no,B00E6LJ1OA,Will it import data from Quicken Starter 2012 without any glitches.Is there a lot of difference in functionality?,?,"As long as your data is from another ""Starter"" edition, it will import it. However if you used any other edition, such as ""Deluxe"", it will not work. I did not find any difference in functionality."
8825,open-ended,B00E6LJ1OA,"What's the difference between the Deluxe and Starter Edition? Also, will this work with Windows 8?",,I think the Starter Edition was more simplified. It had just what required. The Deluxe has more categories than I needed. It will work on 8 I am sure. It should tell you requirements.
8826,yes/no,B00E6LJ1OA,is it multi user say on 3 computers,N,Sorry. I do not know.
8827,open-ended,B00E6LJ1OA,I do not have Quicken but am going to become treasurer for an organization whose former treasurer uses it will this edition allow me to import records,,"The Deluxe version definitely does, I just looked. I initially had Quicken Starter, but I never did a file import. ... because after I had it for a couple of weeks I received a great update offer from Quicken to the Deluxe version. I know this does not answer your question directly, but I can say this software package is incredible. I do a lot with the Deluxe version."
8828,open-ended,B00E6LILGE,"The three users can use the program , but I need to buy licences for each one of them?",,"The QB Pro 3 User is a 3 user license. If you buy the one user, you will have to buy 2 additional licenses on line. FYI: The three user license is for 3 concurrent users. More computers can be networked, but only three can use at the same time."
8829,yes/no,B00E6LILGE,are there 3 discs so each user can put on their own computer,N,No there is just one disc with the ability to install the software on 3 computers. You don't need three discs just one.
8830,open-ended,B00E6LILGE,In the (3) user version of PRO can each user have a copy on their laptop in addition to the office computer installation?,,"No, it is just a three computer installation and registration, including the latop."
8831,open-ended,B00E6LILGE,I want to upgrade our QB Pro 2014 to multi user. I spoke to QB customer service and was told in order to do this it would cost $449.90. I expected this but was then told I would have to pay $449.90 every year to have multi-user. I have used multi-user...,,"the only reoccurring costs I know of are the subscriptions like PAYROLL. We also only buy the new version every 3 years, because after 3 years they stop supporting them. $499.90 yearly would be to buy the new version of the software... which you don't have to do."
8832,yes/no,B00E6LILGE,does this program come with service from Intuit as well?,?,their service is a joke.
8833,open-ended,B00E6LILGE,"Has anyone used this program to manage rental properties? If so, how did it work?",,Having some problems; not as user friendly as the version it is replacing.
8834,open-ended,B00E6LILGE,with the 3 user version - can each user set up a different company?,,You can setup as many companies as you like. The 3 user pack simply allows up to 3 people to access the same company and the same time.
8835,open-ended,B00E6LILGE,"The three users can use the program , but I need to buy licences for each one of them?",,When you purchase a multi user you purchase a license for all the users.
8836,open-ended,B00E6LILGE,what kind of businesses use this package?,,It can be used by any business as it is a general accounting package. Be aware you are forced to upgrade every few years. There are other accounting packages available.
8837,yes/no,B00E6LILGE,does this include disc media?,Y,"Yes, mine did."
8838,open-ended,B00E6LJBUO,upgrade from 2011?,,"Absolutely not. The smart phone app worked poorly. Worst for me, is the failure to hold the cursor in the same position in Quicken when you move between programs. It is a common complaint making register entries more time consuming. Nothing added of value in 2014 and a number of negatives. I quickly went back to 2010 version."
8839,yes/no,B00E6LJBUO,"After converting my Quicken 2012 data over to Quicken 2014, is there any way to revert back? Quicken 2014 is so full of bugs and issues (that Intuit cannot even start to fix) that I really want to go back. And Quicken Mobile is a marketing joke -...",?,"That may not be possible without loosing the data input that you have done between versions. In Windows we can go to File&gt;Properties&gt;Previous Versions. Or, if you could save your current Quicken data file in a safe place (out of reach of an installation effort), you might be able to install the 2012 over the 2014."
8840,yes/no,B00E6LJBUO,Does Quicken Premier carry over data from Quicken Deluxe?,?,It did for me.
8841,yes/no,B00E6LJBUO,does quicken 2014 work on windows 8?,Y,Yes. 8 and. 8.1.
8842,yes/no,B00E6LJBUO,Can I upgrade from Premier 2009 to 2014?,Y,"Yes, it is very easy. Just put the disk in and follow instructions. I saved mine just before starting as insurance so I would not loose anything if I did something dumb. I have been a Quicken user for over 20 years and the 2014 version is the first time I have been disappointed. I have a Dell Studio XPS 16 inch because I travel a lot. My old 2011 version worked wonderful with the size of my computer. The 2014 version works and transferred easily; however, I had to purchase a pair of readers to see parts of what is on the computer, while the rest is so large you cannot see it on one screen even by extending the size. If I did not need it for investments, I would go back to old version. If you wonder where the search bar is, its the tiny oval at top right. When entering a check, the transaction description is completely altered. You just have to scroll through volumes of data to find what your looking for and put it in your memory bank in order to find it again. Everything I have had since 1 January 1990 when I moved to Quicken is still there, just a little hard to find sometimes. I hope this helps. I just have nasty thoughts about a company and their programmers have to mess something up that is working just fine. If you need more help, feel free to contact me again. Linda"
8843,open-ended,B00E6LJBUO,"Can you write and print checks in quicken premier 2014? If yes, how?",,Yes. Because it's a long answer suggest you Google the question.
8844,yes/no,B00E6LJBUO,Can you write checks with this program?,Y,yes you can. you have to order the checks that are made for Quicken. Are you planning to use Quicken for personal or for business? If you want it for business I recommend QuickBooks instead. It does a better job with reports.
8845,yes/no,B00E6LJBUO,Will Quicken 2014 carry over my data from Quicken 2008 ?,Y,"Yes. Always make a backup, but it will work with your data."
8846,open-ended,B00E6LJBUO,"Given the poor performance of this software, what options do users have for preserving their valuable data?",,"I've been using this software since 1998 (16 years). I'm currently using Quicken Premier 2014 with no issues. I always backup date files weekly to an off line portable storage devise. All upgrades along the way where without problems. Caution, do not backup to a Stick Storage device."
8847,open-ended,B00E6LJBUO,How can I download vanguard accounts?,,I will let you know when I figure this out. It should work but there is something I am missing. If you figure this out please let me know.
8848,open-ended,B00E6LJAOG,Can I setup more than one company on this software and have it record transactions for each company?,,"Yes. You can have multiple Quicken files--one for each company. I currently use 3 separate files--one for my personal accounts, one for my business, and another for my husband's business. You can have one business and your personal accounts in a single file, but I prefer separate files."
8849,yes/no,B00E6LJAOG,First time to use Quicken. Was getting ready to order but now concerned after reading reviews. Any thoughts?,?,"I have been using Quicken for about 10 years. It is generally OK, but not spectacular. If you are starting fresh and setting up new accounts, you'll probably be fine. But, the latest update from 2013 to 2014 has been very problematic for me, starting with One Step Update not working properly, and some strange entries being made all on it's own. Quicken tends to ""fix"" things that aren't broken. I might try Microsoft Money, or maybe some other accounting software if I was just starting out."
8850,open-ended,B00E6LJAOG,What is the difference between the purchase choices of PC or PC download? I get the download option....but what's the PC option? Also a download only?,,They send you a CD in a box.
8851,yes/no,B00E6LJAOG,Can I import all my data from Quicken Home and Business 2009?,Y,Yes
8852,open-ended,B00E6LJAOG,For the Home/Bus 2014 can you set up a customer base and use a calendar feature to set up appts too? IE: private,,I have so many problems with this Quicken program that I doubt I will ever renew or buy more for it.
8853,yes/no,B00E6LJAOG,Is 2014 compatible with windows 8.1?,Y,Yes
8854,open-ended,B00E6LJAOG,"Where are my data files to be held, laptop or cloud?",,"Hello In your down load file you can pick were it's go Hard drive, disk or any were thank g"
8855,yes/no,B00E6LJAOG,Will this Quicken print imprinted checks?,Y,yes
8856,yes/no,B00E6LJAOG,Does it work,?,"I have been using Quicken Home & Business for many, many years and it works very well for me. I use it for personal and my small home based business."
8857,yes/no,B00E6LJAOG,does Quicken run on ubuntu/google chrome?,N,"This version will not run on Ubuntu... I've tried. Not sure, but don't think you can install anything on Chromebook."
8858,open-ended,B00E6LIUXI,"If I use the program on two different computers, can you see the updated information on each computer? So if I do Mrs. Jone's invoice on computer A, and then I go and work on computer B, will her invoice be there?",,"Depends on where you store the files. If you use a type of Internet storage application (Dropbox - for example), then yes. If you store the files locally, then no. Hope this helps. I also am a 1 license user."
8859,yes/no,B00E6LIUXI,"I have a Mac desktop and a mac book pro laptop, I would like to have it installed on both computers. Do I need to have two licenses?",Y,"Technically they may say so because it's on two different machines, but I have it at work and used same for my laptop and had no issues."
8860,yes/no,B00E6LIUXI,does this work on XP?,Y,"This version is compatible with Windows XP if you have installed SP3; however, it is no longer supported since Windows XP has reached end of life as an operating system. Source https://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/Support/Articles/INF24382"
8861,yes/no,B00E6LIUXI,"If I purchase this today (9/17/2014), will I get a free upgrade to Quickbooks Premier 2015 when it becomes available?",?,"Not that I'm aware of. I purchased QB 2010 when it came out and used it for several years until they discontinued services to it. I have had to pay for all newer versions. They give you free product updates to the software, but not to newer versions. I'm not sure how it works with the online version, but this has been my experience with the desktop versions."
8862,yes/no,B00E6LIUXI,I do tax work for a dentist. He has recently started his personal LLC. Would this product be a one time go to for all his bookkeeping/accounting needs,Y,"It depends. Short answer is yes, but depending on how he has the LLC set up it may be better to go with Quicken. If the LLC is set up to be taxed as a corporation then QuickBooks would be the way to go. However if the LLC is set up to be taxed as a sole proprietor, then it would be better to use Quicken."
8863,yes/no,B00E6LIUXI,Can I install on two computers for 1 user?,N,I do not believe so.
8864,open-ended,B00E6LIUXI,is this product on a disk or download?,,It is available for download.
8865,yes/no,B00E6LIUXI,I have QB Premier 2014 with product code 647-279 and I would like to buy an additional license.Your product code is 282-230.Will Intuit allow merge?,?,"I believe that it would be ok. From my understanding the product code is what tells the program how many licenses you have available to use. My question to you is do you really need the additional license? If you are only using a single license, then I would say you would need more, but if you have a multi license, of 3 or 5, do you actually have that many people using QuickBooks at one time? That is the benefit of having multiple licenses. Otherwise, if you are the only one using it and just need to install it on say your laptop, you can, as long as you only use one copy at a time."
8866,open-ended,B00E6LIUXI,"Please provide the product number. In my experience, Intuit will not facilitate adding a license unless the product number matches one's existing #",,"I tend to lose manuals or throw them away after a time. If that where your license & product #'s are, you want to actually write them on your disc with a permanent marker. The product # I have is 282-230."
8867,yes/no,B00E6LIUXI,Can you purchase this software and use it to create one company as wholesale and another as retail? Please be specific.,Y,you should be able to create multiple companies with the software I currently use it to run a mechanic shop a landscaping company and a dealership so yes you should be able to the information will be separate between the two but you should be unless you're wanting to use or have the wholesale and retail together
8868,yes/no,B00E6LJ1RW,Is there an additional charge per paycheck of $2.14 if the software is not downloaded directly from Intuit as noted in a previous review? I understand that there is a $2.00 per employee per month charge for more than 1 employee.,?,I was told over the phone by QB this past Thursday that EACH paycheck has a fee of $2.14 and EACH direct deposit has a fee of $1.50 UNLESS you get the download directly from them. Obsurd!
8869,yes/no,B00E6LJ1RW,does this have unlimted employees,N,"No, it only allows one employee. For more you have to talk to intuit and pay per extra employee per month. The last time I talked to Intuit they implied that they no longer did unlimited employees unless you were renewing such a subscription which can only be done though them."
8870,yes/no,B00E6LJ1RW,Does it include worker's compensation reports?,?,There are two options within the payroll section - Setup new worker's compensation payment service and manually track existing worker's compensation policy. I have not personally use this feature so I have no first hand experience with it.
8871,open-ended,B00E6LJ1RW,How many employees will this system accommodate. We have 6,,"We have more than 6 and so your answer is yes. It looks like that the 2014 program will allow 1 employee and then $2.00 per additional employee per month. That is a new charge. So for 6 employees, you will pay $10.00 per month."
8872,yes/no,B00E6ONJRM,"can I use this on 5 PC,s?",Y,"You can use any Windows PC or android device you want... laptop, desktop, tablet,smartphone, etc. Yes. You can use it on 5 PC's."
8873,open-ended,B00E6ONJRM,hello my question is about which is the strongest and full kaspersky antivirus for pc,,"I've always gone with the one with the greatest amount of protection, which at the moment seems to be Kaspersky pure. Not only does it have antivirus, but there's the firewall, it can make you invisible to the casual ""whois"" search, it has virtual keyboard, which protects you against keyloggers, then there's the password manager, which allows you to set secure, completely random passwords, without the need to write them down or remember them (although I do use the printout function from time to time and store THAT is a hidden location- in case Kaspersky crashes), it has a master password itself so that only those who have the master password can use it, PLUS a separate master password for viewing passwords in the manager (and using the feature that automatically enters your login & password- except on secure sites that forbid that- in which case I use the virtual keyboard), and to top it off, it includes the ""to go"" feature via cloud, so you can access the most commonly needed functions from any computer. There's a lot more, but it would take me forever to list it. Basically, after a computer at work was hacked and IT ended up entirely helpless, I was the one who managed to restore things properly, and researched various products (they'd been using Nortoon, and had NOTHING on their server). I decidedd on Kaspersky. It's leaner and meaner than Norton (leaner=uses less RAM). It pretty much has everything someone might want in the way of security, and I tend to be a bit paranoid when it comes to my computer's security. It even helped me track down some cyberbullies who very nearly drove a disabled lady to suicide... In desperation, I was able to track her down. The police found her with a glass of water... and a glass full of pills the was preparing to take. Kaspersky helped save her life."
8874,yes/no,B00E6ONJRM,I am interested in Kaspersky Internet Security Multi Device (5-User) $39.99. Can it work with 4 desktops and 1 laptop?,Y,Yes it works flawlessly for five devices.
8875,yes/no,B00E6ONJRM,Does this work on windows 8?,?,This works flawlessly on Windows 8 and 8.1.
8876,yes/no,B00E6ONJRM,It says on the box it works on windows 8 but on the description it is not listed. Does it work on 8?,Y,Yes it does. I have it installed on my laptop which uses Win 8
8877,open-ended,B00E6ONJRM,"Friend, prdoucto comes in sealed box, as is the picture? regards",,Yes it does. That assures you the product has not been previously opened or tampered with.
8878,open-ended,B00E6ONJRM,i have 2014 installed in my devices and it's about time to renew now. i like to verify if i could install this for 2015?,,"You should have no problem doing so, but if you were to renew the one u have, it should update to the newer version without u having to do anything. have u check to make sure it's still the 2014 version?"
8879,open-ended,B00E6ONJRM,I am very new to tablet arena; just bought one. This Kaspersky product comes in a CD; how do I install it to a tablet?,,You can even download via wifi online.
8880,yes/no,B00E6ONJRM,Can you send me only the activation code?,?,"Yes,Here you go friend! IWAS-BORN-DUMB-CANU-BELI-EVEIT"
8881,yes/no,B00E6ONJRM,I have an Apple iPad. Will it work for it?,N,No
8882,open-ended,B00E6OPDU8,How does a key card work? Does it also compatible to win 8.1?,,"Thank you for your question. You are provided with an license key and a link. You follow the link in order to download your software on your computer, put in the license key, and install the application. Instead of using a CD to install the software, you use the internet. And yes, it will work with Windows 8.1 Hope this helps!"
8883,open-ended,B00E6OPDU8,Is it just good for 2014 or can you get three years on one computer?,,it is good for just one year after installing and you can use it on 3 computers.
8884,yes/no,B00E6OPDU8,Will this work with Vista?,Y,"Yes, Windows 7, Vista, XP"
8885,yes/no,B00E6OPDU8,does it work with windows 8.1,Y,Yes.
8886,yes/no,B00E6OPDU8,Can you use this to renew an existing subscription to McAfee Internet Security?,Y,Yes. It will take you to the website where you enter your username and password.
8887,open-ended,B00E6OPDU8,I believe that if you are interested in a specific type of internet security or other...just download the 15 days or 30 days trial and try it?,,"Only if you go directly to the McAfee site, I believe. That said, I've tried Norton as well as several other internet security programs. McAfee has always performed well for me, and for the money, cannot be beat."
8888,yes/no,B00E6OPDU8,will I get the new updates downloaded to my computer online from McAfee for 1 year?,Y,Yes! ..sometimes I get several in one day ...
8889,open-ended,B00E6OPDU8,If I purchase two of these will the licenses stack? Will I get two years?,,"I'm not sure. I was under the impression that the the software wouldn't be valid until you activated it, so you may be fine."
8890,open-ended,B00E6OPE0M,"I have a subscription to Mcafee that runs out in a month, if I buy this item will I be able to extend my current subscription?",,yes...I just did that!!!all is well
8891,open-ended,B00E6OPE0M,Will this run on Windows 8.1? Can I backup only to my USB drive?,,Yes and yes you can
8892,yes/no,B00E6OPE0M,Does this work on Vista?,Y,"Yes, SP1 both 32 and 64-bit"
8893,yes/no,B00E6OPE0M,does this product include a CD?,?,no it is just a card thing with a number you have to go to the site and put in a number code and then download the soft wear from the site I was not to happy with it
8894,yes/no,B00E6OPE0M,"once installed, is this protection for one year?",Y,Yes
8895,open-ended,B00E6OPE0M,Does this expire a year after I activate it or when the 2015 version comes out?,,After one year.
8896,open-ended,B00E6OPE0M,What is the latest version of Mcafee Total Protection?,,2014
8897,open-ended,B00E6OPE0M,2014 is almost over and the 2015 version is $80 while 2014 version is $15. Is there a reason I should even consider spending $80? What is the diff?,,I have used Total Protection for years and I can assure you I receive updates automatically and frequently thereby keeping my 2014 edition current against new threats. I would use the 2014 to save the money. McAfee will keep it current.
8898,yes/no,B00E6OPE0M,DOES HAVE TO BE RENEWED EACH YEAR?,?,"Yes, but 'don't automatically' renew directly through McAfee due to their high pricing. Look for better sale of McAfee offered through Amazon each year."
8899,open-ended,B00E6OPE0M,why is this price so much cheaper then mcafee auto renewal price,,Same reason that a public library buys a book for much higher price than you and I do. McAfee is charging you the MSRP for renewal. I am not charging you MSRP.
8900,yes/no,B00E6ONJJU,what's the difference between anti-virus and internet security...do you need both,Y,"anti-virus provides protection only against virus and similar threats, while internet security has a firewall together to protect your inbound and outbound connection, filtering what program can connect/go outside your PC or network and blocking unwanted connection attempts to your PC. This is good because if a new unknown Trojan virus could infect your PC, it will try to connect with the owner of this virus to get access to your PC and it's files, in this case a firewall can automatically block this outbound connection unless you allow it manually."
8901,yes/no,B00E6ONJJU,Does this work on a computer in Europe? Last year I bought Kaspersky 2013 and tried to install it in Europe. It didn't go through. Please advise.,?,No it is doesnt. already tried it in europe. it is intended for activation in US region. it won't activated anywhere else.
8902,open-ended,B00E6ONJJU,I see both the 2014 and the 2015 versions. 2014 cheaper. Why not get the cheaper and have it automatically upgrade during or after install?,,"I always buy the previous version, because my license runs out the first week in July. 2015 wasn't out when I placed my order for 2014. In the past, the new version didn't come out until the middle of August. This is the first time the new version came out in July. So, when I received my order, I just downloaded the 2015 version and installed it, and entered the Activation Number from off the disk in the box. If you install 2014, you will have to uninstall it and download 2015. 2014 will not upgrade to 2015. So, just buy 2014 and when you receive it, then download the 2015 version and install it. Hope this help you."
8903,open-ended,B00E6ONJJU,"So I activated this on 1 PC and I got 365 days remaining, When I got to activate this on another PC it gave me 355 days remaining. Why is that?",,When you activate the first license all three start
8904,open-ended,B00E6ONJJU,How to uninstall software,,"After doing what Brent suggested, you may also want to run the Kaspersky removal tool: http://support.kaspersky.com/common/service.aspx?el=1464#block1. I believe this uninstalls all traces of the Kaspersky products listed. I always run the tool from the antivirus vendor after uninstalling, just to make sure it cleans up everything."
8905,yes/no,B00E6ONJJU,Will it stop pop ups? My computer seems to be overrun by them even with the blocker on.,?,"Kaspersky internet security includes ""Anti-Banner"". The Anti-Banner blocks annoying banner ads (including popups.)"
8906,open-ended,B00E6ONJJU,"If I make the purchase, could I get the code to download the new version asap or would I have to wait for the delivery via ups",,You will need to wait as the program code is printed on the cd sleeve.
8907,open-ended,B00E6ONJJU,"If I purchase Interner Security, do also need to purchase their Ant-Virus software? Isn't that redundant?",,"no,,internet security does what their antivirus does and more"
8908,yes/no,B00E6ONJJU,"as know im on my own, I don't know which Anti virus to get for beginners, will this be pretty easy for me?",?,"If you want help with your computer, go to your nearest Staples, Best Buy or Office Depot and have them install something. If you are comfortable installing your own software, Kaspersky is a good choice. Not the only choice on the market but it will protect and survive most computer attacks."
8909,yes/no,B00E6ONJJU,"I have 2 computers. One unit is 32 bit Vista, the other is 64 bit Windows 7. Will the same Kaspersky disk work for both computers?",Y,Yes but you can download current copies and use the code from the package to authorize. Fresher versions.
8910,yes/no,B00E6ONJKO,Can i activate my product in 50 days? I still got protection for 50 more days....,Y,Yes you can. And it will start off with a full year! So dont waste your days left on what you still have.
8911,open-ended,B00E6ONJKO,Can anyone tell me how to un-do Google Chrome's block on my Kaspersky extensions??,,"No,I ha0d to take Kaspersky to my computer guy just to install. He took two day to install it. Good bye kaspersky."
8912,yes/no,B00E6ONJKO,can it be used with Windows 8 and 8.1?,Y,yes
8913,open-ended,B00E6ONJKO,Why is the 1-user version $5.00 more than the 3-user version? I only need to use it once and am irritated that the single version is more.,,You should direct your question to Amazon -- they set their prices.
8914,yes/no,B00E6ONJKO,the article says regional restrictions apply. not for sale outside the us or canada. would i be able to activate and use this in the middle east?,?,U.S. or Canada only sorry
8915,open-ended,B00E6ONJKO,compare 1 user vs. 3 users,,1 user means you only can install on 1 computer. With 3 users you can install it on up to 3 computers.
8916,yes/no,B00E6ONJKO,Can I use this product License in Dominican Republic?,?,"I know that they are a global company. However, I don't know if the dominican Republic is their network. Perhaps you could research this by going to www.kaspersky.com."
8917,open-ended,B00E6ONJKO,if i buy this one you will send the code to my e-mail ?,,The code should be on the disc itself.
8918,yes/no,B00E6ONJKO,is it still possible to download from the internet after purchase ? I don't have a disc drive,Y,Yes
8919,open-ended,B00E6ONJKO,What is the duration for this license?,,365 day.
8920,open-ended,B00E6OPDUS,how much is the yearly renewal?,,"If you purchase it from Amazon for $17.00, that is what the yearly prescription is and if you purchase it from McAfee you will probably pay 3 to 4 times that amount. I purchase my Mcafee protection from Amazon every year and have had no problems with the product. You get the same protection for a year at a cheaper price. When you get the product and load it on your computer McAfee will more than likely ask you if you want to automatically renew it at the end of the prescription and then you will go to the higher price."
8921,open-ended,B00E6OPDUS,"I have Windows 7 which takes a disc, how would I install this?",,"There is a card that comes via postal mail from Amazon; this card was printed by McAfee and has a product code on it, along with a website address to download the software direct from McAfee. The product code must be entered into the web page, your are then able to download the install the software, the website basically does it all for you."
8922,open-ended,B00E6OPDUS,Where is the serial number to install on 2nd and 3rd computers?,,There is no other serial number. You go on the McAfee website and log into your account and then add another computer under your active account.
8923,open-ended,B00E6OPDUS,Why do I need 1) total protection 2) Internet security 3) antivirus security --- total doesn't do total?? thank,,"McAfee Total Protection-is all you need. Features; Protects against viruses and malware, blocks spam and dangerous email, Guard your PC, social network, identity, family, and home network with our ultimate protection against hackers, thieves, phishing, and other online threats."
8924,open-ended,B00E6OPDUS,Mac support?,,"This is just 3 license keys.... you can choose to activate & assign license keys to either Mac or PC or both. I personally have 1 license assigned to a Mac and 2 assigned on Windows PC's. Other platforms like Android, you should download that software from the appropriate App Store."
8925,open-ended,B00E6OPDUS,"Does this work&gt;=? How do you use a card? Do you go to the McCafe website? Last year, bought same thing in 2013 version w.disk and did not work.",,"It definitely works! There is no card, only a code that's required to download the software. If you currently have an older/outdated version on your computer, you'll have to uninstall before installing the new software. If you run into a problem, simply call the McAfee 800 number and they'll install for you. It couldn't be more simple :-)"
8926,yes/no,B00E6OPDUS,Does it constantly update itself?,Y,Yes to take care of immediate threat.
8927,yes/no,B00E6OPDUS,Will this product work in Australia?,?,"Hi I have this registered in US but active on computers in several EU countries for my family. I have 2 * 3 PC licenses, used to have 3. Don't see why should not work in Australia."
8928,yes/no,B00E6OPDUS,Can the product be downloaded from the Internet ?,?,"It is all web based. You purchase the product, they send you a product key and follow the instructions to d/l the software from their site."
8929,yes/no,B00E6OPDUS,will it work on windows vista?,?,"Yes.System Requirements Windows XP SP3 or higher(32-bit) Windows Vista SP1 (32- and 64-bit) Windows 7 (32- and 64-bit) Windows 8 (32- and 64-bit) 512 MB RAM for XP 2GB RAM for Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 500 MB free dive space 1 GHz processor"
8930,open-ended,B00E7X9RUK,How many installations are permitted with purchase?,,You can install on multiple computers but you can only sync with one Account using quicken cloud. If your using for personal use you wouldn't want to have it on multiple computers because you would ultimately have two separate day files that would not be the same unless you save the file to an external source such as a thumb drive or external hard drive.
8931,yes/no,B00E7X9RUK,Will Quicken Deluxe 2014 convert historical bank account information from Microsoft Money programs?,Y,"Yes. I converted to Quicken deluxe 2011 when MM was abandoned. Man I wish MM.....Anyway, this crappy program really is the next best thing out there and converts all your data without a hitch. I had 3 years worth of financial info that converted fine. The problem with this is the inconsistent crashes, inconsistent download errors from your bank (some days it works, others it doesn't) and other failures."
8932,open-ended,B00E7X9RUK,"5 Bugs and no resolution from Quicken. What a joke. Cut/Paste feature doesn't work, online updates do not update balances first time during one step",,"Yep... this version of Quicken is not what it should be. One work-around that I've found for cut/paste not working is to go into Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Set Up. CHANGE your setting for the Keyboard Mappings to be Quicken standard instead of Windows Standard. Click OK and then close Quicken. Then restart Quicken and go back into the same menu, and change the setting back to Windows standard. Now cut/paste should work. Or, at least it will work for a while... expect to have to go through these steps again in a few weeks."
8933,open-ended,B00E7X9RUK,Is the lower priced Amazon version of Quicken Deluxe the same as the higher cost software that Intuit sells? What do I give up buying from Amazon?,,"Same version, you just don't get a CD. But I saw a comment that you can redownload from Amazon if you need to. Probably cheaper since no inventory required and no processing costs."
8934,yes/no,B00E7X9RUK,Can you download from Bank of America?,Y,"Yes, I can do a download but it has changed during the previous version and I had to contact the bank before it worked again."
8935,open-ended,B00E7X9RUK,Has Quicken Deluxe 2014 improved with R4? Did you install with the CD or Amazon download? Thank you.,,For me it was a great improvement since I upgraded from 2009. I especially like the fact that my information is only one file now. I did the Amazon download. Hope this helps.
8936,yes/no,B00E7X9RUK,is it windows 8.1 compatable,Y,Yes. I am running Quicken Deluxe 2014 on a Windows 8.1 machine
8937,yes/no,B00E7X9RUK,"haven't up dated for many years, currently using XP, which after April 8, no support.......would it be better to wait to update Quicken after I may have to get new computor?",?,"Hi Chancey: The only advice I can give you is that my old PC was dying, and I waited until I got my new one before downloading the updated Quicken. I was afraid if I loaded it to my old PC, it would totally crash. So that's what I would advise, but I'm definitely not an expert."
8938,yes/no,B00E7X9RUK,Can I find out if Netspend is on the list of financial institutions this year?,N,Netspend is not set up to provide transactions for Quicken.
8939,open-ended,B00E7X9RUK,Will I be able to download this software 3 separate times to 3 different computers? Is there a time limit for doing this?,,"HI, I have 2 laptops and one PC that I use with Quicken...all resistered to me.."
8940,yes/no,B00E7XAM4K,Is this a subscription for one year?,?,"The program is good for as long as you want, although there are yearly updates if you would to purchase them. The program will continue to without purchasing the updates."
8941,open-ended,B00E7XAM4K,I am trying to figure out what I am getting with this download if I purchase it. Is it just the manual? Do I then have to pay Intuit a monthly fee?,,There is not a monthly fee. You will receive instructions on how to set up your accounts. There are yearly updates that you may purchase if you like but is not necessary for the program to continue to function.
8942,yes/no,B00E7XAM4K,can you run payroll with an additional fee on simple start?,Y,"Yes you can. Inside the ""Employees"" menu you can ""Turn on Payroll"". Pricing starts at $39 and there is 20% discount at this moment (Sept. 17, 2014). In my case, I use Intuit Payroll beside and I make a direct import/link into QuickBooks."
8943,open-ended,B00E7XAM4K,"It is not clear if this is a subscription online service product, if so how many months does the current $49.99 cover? 12months?",,I subscribe at $9.99 a month plus tax
8944,open-ended,B00E7XAM4K,I only use Quick Books to make checks. Will this simple one make checks and keep a registar? Also can I buy the disc instead of the download?,,"Probably not because this web based ""software"" offered for $50 (what I paid this past april) is only a trial version. Do not buy this software if you have any remote.idea of trying Intuit's 60 day money back guarantee. Approximately 30 days after purchase, I first had dialog with Amazon customer service. In that I was told I would have to go to Intuit. Since Amazon customer service has always served me well, I took the info and called Intuit. Since that call, I have gone round and.round with them claiming to make the refund process simple. ......I still haven't gotten my refund and don't expect to because of the hassle Intuit has put me through. This software is just the beginning of what Intuit wants to sell you."
8945,yes/no,B00E7XAM4K,Will this work with an iPad Mini?,?,"this month, QuickBooks doesn't seem to work on any of my techno stuff... partially but not fully operational on anything... HP & ACER laptops (3 years old) - home built destop - nor IPad (never used on it... need much more room to see) so the mini is a choice."
8946,yes/no,B00E7XAM4K,Does this work with the Quickbooks Point of Sale system?,?,"I doubt it. Even if it did work, Intuit will CHANGE the way the products work AFTER you buy them.. For instance I use QB Online and they changed the way purchase orders are emailed so now they are ALWAYS sent to the spam folder, quickbooks wanted to remove the right of the users to use their own emails and now they are sent from a spammy intuit email address.. Worst company ever, do not trust them."
8947,yes/no,B00E7XAM4K,"If I use QuickBooks Simple Start and want to upgrade to purchased software in the future, can I move all my data over?",Y,Yes.
8948,yes/no,B00E7XAM4K,I have been using 2008 quickbook simple start and need something more advanced. Is this version a better one than I'm using,Y,Yes. Go to Intuit.com and take a look at the sample pages. It is far better than the simple start
8949,yes/no,B00E7XAM4K,Can I use this program to create accounts for both my business and my personal finances?,?,"If your question is whether you can create two separate ""company accounts"" (one each for business use and one for personal use) under a single subscription, then unfortunately the answer is no. I ended up just using the online version for my small company, and kept using my older quickbooks version for my personal accounting. But if you want to know if you are able to segregate personal expenses from business expenses within a single company account to be able to easily distinguish which items were for business and which were for personal, then the answer is yes. It is very easy to create new charter of accounts and personalize as many expense accounts as you need. The only problem with this though is when you print P/L statements and do not want personal expenses, the report will include ALL expenses, business and personal. Hope this helped."
8950,yes/no,B00EAS14KI,Can you edit commeral?,?,"I'm not sure that I understand the word ""commeral"" but the Dazzle capture device only captures video. It is the associated software package that comes with it that provides for the editing of video. If the video already exists in digital form (DVD or computer file) there are other comparable software packages available for editing. The Dazzle DVD recorder is typically used to capture VHS tapes in a digital computer based format. Hope this helps."
8951,yes/no,B00EAS14KI,does this device capture in avi?,Y,Yes it does Dayna. The video editing software that comes with it has this feature in its recording settings.
8952,yes/no,B00EAS14KI,I can not capture my video using a Hi8 camcorder hooked to the dazzle. Does anyone have suggestions?,?,"Is the Hi8 camera digital? The Dazzle is an analog-to-digital device and should only work with analog video sources. There are other ways to bring digital video into an editing program. On the other hand, if your Hi8 is analog, is it a matter of your editing software not recognizing the Dazzle?"
8953,open-ended,B00EAS14KI,So inorder to transfer vas to DVDs on this device it has to go thru my computer? Is this correct? Tammy,,"Yes. The unit plugs into a USB port, and is recognized by the computer as a digital input device. You need video capture and editing software to bring over the video and edit and manipulate it in the computer. The unit comes with software for that: ""Pinnacle Studio for Dazzle""."

8959,yes/no,B00EAS14KI,can you stream,Y,"Yes you can stream, this is what I use it for. This isn't exactly made for streaming though, but you can. I had issues with the audio while using OBS, but there may not be audio issues with other streaming software. I had to use another recording software and use that as the video capture for OBS.

Now assuming you have the proper connecting cables from your LP Record player to the computer ! .. If you do have all the proper cables !! I would advice you to 1st convert LP to an MP3 file with a converting software, where you can edit and remove the scratches, once done then use Power2Go 9 Platinum ( Go to Music Disc, to the right you'll see Audio CD, click on Audio CD to create your traditional audio music CD ), then play your newly created Audio CD on any audio CD player ( Hi-Fi CD player, Car CD Player and portable radio CD players.... ) I hope this information is useful.."

8991,yes/no,B00EDSI7K0,Is this available as a download?,N,This package does not contain a disc....it contains the key for a download
8992,yes/no,B00EDSI7K0,Can I use the key to simply activate an already installed trial version of 8.1 Pro on my PC?,?,"Sorry I really don't know. I think the key only unlocks the disk and allows files to be installed. Once you install it and updated you get a different product key. If you right click on the left bottom of screen on the windows icon and then click on System. Once the window pops up scroll down to the bottom and you will see where is says Windows Activated and Product ID. I don't know if it would take the number or not. The number is program into the disk and may not be an online number. All you can do is try or call Microsoft, I don't think it would work."
8993,yes/no,B00EDSI7K0,Do i need windows 8 to down load windows 8.1 pro version,?,"It depends on what you buy. You can buy 8.1 Pro in the first place, or you can buy upgrades. If you have Windows 8 already installed, you'll want to do the free Windows 8.1 update. Then you can go to the Microsoft store and do the Professional upgrade. You have two choices there. Buy the upgrade online, or if you've bought it elsewhere, you can just put in the license code."
8994,yes/no,B00EDSI7K0,Does this will upgrade from Windows 8.1 32-bit to Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit?,?,"To the best of my knowledge, you cannot upgrade from 32bit to 64bit, but must do a fresh install."
8995,yes/no,B00EDSI7K0,"Original OS Win 8, updated to 8.1. Will the Win 8.1 Pro Pack install correctly on my PC?",Y,"Yes, it did work for me. However, after entering the code, it ""seemed"" like it wasn't working until I rebooted, during which the upgrade occurred."
8996,open-ended,B00EDSI7K0,"hello, I ordered a windows 8.1 pro pack for my dad and now he cannot find the key. I have the order number and other details with me. Please help.",,"if you bought it from a third party vendor and not from Microsoft Store , you can forget about it . I had a similar experience , I got the key from 3rd party Microsoft partner . They don't respond to mails or have any help desk , after MS r contacting MS , they said they cant do anything either and suck it up ! MS can only track if it was purchased from their store ."
8997,yes/no,B00EDSI7K0,does this include publisher,N,No it does not.
8998,open-ended,B00EDSI7K0,what does it do?,,"It helps you to upgrade from windows 8.1 to windows 8.1pro. Hit windows button on the keyboard, type ""add features to windows 8.1 "" and you'll be prompted to enter the windows 8.1 pro key code and upgrade the windows 8.1 to windows 8.1 pro. 100% good"
8999,open-ended,B00EDSI7K0,"When I get pro pack, what tuner should I get for windows media center if I already have AVermedia TV Player installed and usb tuner for AVermedia?",,I use Hauppauge. Hauppauge come's with a disk that is compatible to windows 8.1.Pro. However Microsoft will still charge you 10.00 for windows media center via download. Windows Pro Pack is only an upgrade from Windows 8. So if you have Windows 8 and the one you have works then it will work for 8.1 Pro.
9000,yes/no,B00EDSI7K0,"Will this key upgrade Win 8.1 Home to 8.1 Pro? I'm not quite sure what they mean by Win 8.1 ""core"" in their description",?,I have used this about 15 times with no problems. Make sure that you go to the Windows Store and upgrade from 8 to 8.1 before you apply this pack. The upgrade from 8 to 8.1 takes a while so be prepared to wait.
9001,open-ended,B00EDSI7QO,is it 64bit or 32bit ?,,"The retail package comes with both discs, your choice of installation. Same concept applies for Windows Vista - Windows 8. As for digital download, your choice as the product key looks at the edition regardless of architecture."
9002,open-ended,B00EDSI7QO,How about if I need to install the full version on more than one computer. Is there a version with multiple licenses or can a single purchase deal with multiple installs.,,There used to be a Windows 7 Home Premium Family Pack with 3 licenses for $150 but to the best of my knowledge there is no family pack for Window 8. Each Windows 8 license costs $120 for the Home Edition and $200 for the Pro Edition. I recommend you contact either Amazon directly or the Microsoft Store at store.microsoft.com for volume licenses. I just buy Windows 1 copy at a time.
9003,yes/no,B00EDSI7QO,Is it transferable to other PC?,?,"Per my understanding, this can be installed in one PC at a time. Meaning, you cannot have two or more PC running it at the same time - key here is same time. However, if say, your current went up in flames and you built a new one, you can definitely install this version on your new PC. It is the OEM version of win 8.1 that gets tied to hardware, not this full version. Hope this helps."
9004,open-ended,B00EDSI7QO,I am running 32 bit xp with a 3Ghz processor and 4Ghz of ram. My xp only recognizes 3Ghz of the ram. If I upgrade to 8.1 will it erase my hard drive?,,"You cannot go straight from XP to 8.1. You would need to do a ""fresh"" install of 8.1 which means you will lose everything currently on your hard drive. You can reinstall your programs on the new OS if you still have the installation disks available, but this is a long and painful process. Be sure to save any documents to another storage device before beginning the install or you will lose those permanently."
9005,open-ended,B00EDSI7QO,"I am building a new gaming pc from scratch. Can I use this full version of windows 8.1? or I have to use the one that says ""system build""?",,"The other thing is, there is no support for OEM, you're on your own when it comes to troubleshooting. Fortunately, there are some awesome forums to get help and share knowledge."
9006,open-ended,B00EDSI7QO,I want to install Windows 8.1 on my Mac and I need a DVD to do it. Is this a DVD or just a download? Thanks,,"This is a DVD, and works well for the installation on mac."
9007,yes/no,B00EDSI7QO,does this require old windows to install,Y,"This ""Full Version"" is a clean install. It doesn't require an old version of Windows, but if you are presently using Windows 7 you can keep your personal files when installing Win 8. If you are using any version before Win 7, your files will be gone (unless you've backed up)."
9008,yes/no,B00EDSI7QO,"I'm installing a new hard drive on my computer, can I install this OS from scratch?",?,Hi: Yes this is a full install.
9009,yes/no,B00EDSI7QO,does this come with microsoft office?,N,No it does not.
9010,yes/no,B00EDSI7QO,Currently I have Windows 7 32 bit. Can I upgrade to Windows 8.1 64 bit?,?,"With a full 64 bit disc available, you can install the 64 bit version on your 64 bit capable PC. HOWEVER, this is not an upgrade - it is a clean install. This means that everything on your PC is wiped clean and you need to reinstall all your programs, as well as reintroducing your data (emails, pictures, etc.). An upgrade is something that MS allows ONLY 32 bit to 32 bit or 64 bit to 64 bit. Under this scenario, you would not have to do anything with programs or data - they would all continue as before. Therefore, to change to 64 bit from 32 bit is NOT a simple matter, and requires preplanning. Personally, I feel MS should provide this upgrade path but they do not (even for a fee)."
9011,yes/no,B00EDSI8HW,does it include windows media center,N,"No, but you can buy the add-on Windows 8.1 Pro Media Center pack ( $9.99 on the Microsoft site... http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/feature-packs ."
9012,open-ended,B00EDSI8HW,Is this a full retail version in witch you can change your motherboard? Hard-Drive ect?,,"Yes, this is Full Retail. Perform a Full install from Scratch"
9013,yes/no,B00EDSI8HW,is this the 64 bit version,?,"Yes it is. I install it on macbook and it is doning well, no problem so far."
9014,yes/no,B00EDSI8HW,I built a custom PC and want to get Windows 8.1 Pro. Can this be installed on a freshly built PC?,Y,Yes
9015,open-ended,B00EDSI8HW,Whats the difference between this and the oem,,"Microsoft did things different OEM-wise with the product SKUs for 8 and 8.1. The difference is pretty much in the legalese. I'll excerpt from this write-up here: http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612160/microsoft-windows/microsoft-kills-oem-system-builder-and-upgrade-editions-of-windows.html The author (Woody Leonhard, of Windows Secrets) will tell you a lot, but the bit that he pulled from Newegg is probably the detail you're looking for: ""The OEM license allows the OEM to resell the PC. The Personal Use license is for individuals who are building (and supporting) their own PCs. Neither are transferable once on the PC, but the OEM license allows for transferring the entire PC to different users."" Hope that helps!"
9016,yes/no,B00EDSI8HW,Can you use the full version of pro to upgrade a windows 7 machine?,?,"Unfortunately the installation does not give you the option to keep your applications, just your personal data. It does save your old application data in a folder called C:\Windows.old So if you know how or can Google it; it is possible to get your settings back. For example you can find your outlook.pst file, and bookmarks and put them back after you re-install the applications."
9017,yes/no,B00EDSI8HW,Does it come with downgrade rights to Windows 7?,Y,Yes. All Microsoft OS licenses allow you to run previous operating systems. See Microsoft's site for more info: www.microsoft.com/OEM/en/licensing/sblicensing/Pages/downgrade_rights.aspx
9018,yes/no,B00EDSI8HW,"Is this 32-bit, 64-bit or is it both on the same disk?",?,I bought this and it included both discs for 32 and 64 bit operating systems.
9019,yes/no,B00EDSI8HW,Can this be installed on 3 systems?,?,Only if you have three different activation codes
9020,open-ended,B00EDSI8HW,Is this pack the same version as if purchase from MicrosoftStore? In another word I am trying to find out if this is the latest driver? thx.,,Same. Also realize no Operating System installation media has the latest drivers - otherwise they would have to re-package and re-stock too frequently. You just install the currently available version and upgrade the drivers during the upgrade.
9021,yes/no,B00EFRMECQ,Is the drive image saved with a tib extension?,?,True Image 2014 usually saves backup data in the proprietary tib format
9022,yes/no,B00EFRMECQ,"i want to transfer my entire system including os to a larger drive, will this do it?",Y,Yes. It has a feature to resize your partitions to fit the larger drive.
9023,yes/no,B00EFRMECQ,Does it support USB 3.0 hard drives?,?,Yes you can backup to a drive connected to a USB 3.0 port but no... you cannot boot directly off that drive if your drive is connected on a USB 3.0 port. You have to reconnect it to a USB 2.0 port as the BIOS cannot read directly from a 3.0 port. This isn't a big issue as most times you are backing up rather than recovering.
9024,open-ended,B00EFRMECQ,Has anyone tried to restore an image to a dissimilar HDWR set? Like going from Toshiba to HP?,,"I have not tried that particular restore but I have tried from motherboard to motherboard (mostly ASUS or Gigabyte) during hardware upgrades and RARELY got it to work. Occasionally, I would get a decent restore but had to boot into safe mode and monkey around with Fixboot and SFC to get things to boot properly."
9025,open-ended,B00EFRMECQ,Work with Windows 8.1?,,"Yes, it does."
9026,yes/no,B00EFRMECQ,can i backup my computer on a interal hard disk drive,?,"Sure. But if you are backing-up your OS, you should be doing that to a second physical internal hard drive."
9027,yes/no,B00EFRMECQ,Can you use it for 64 bit processors?,Y,"Yes you can, with ""NO"" problems!"
9028,yes/no,B00EFRMECQ,"Can it restore to a smaller drive, ex: restore from original 250GB to new 160GB drive?",N,"Using Acronis True Image 2014 Premium's Universal Restore mode you can restore FILES from a larger drive to a smaller drive provided the files occupy less than the 160GB drive space. However, if you are trying to restore an IMAGE of the 250GB drive to the smaller 160GB drive, this cannot be done."
9029,open-ended,B00EFRMECQ,What Is (MB),,"It refers to My Backup, i.e. the backup data set produced by Acronis."
9030,open-ended,B00EFRMDW2,"Hi, can I back up individual files and folders or I just have to specify the whole disk? I am not interested in backing up the OS.",,"I usually back up full os, but i'm almost positive you can back up individual files. My only gripe with this software is I already owned an older copy and had to purchase a new copy for windows 7!"
9031,yes/no,B00EFRMDW2,"If my computer dies, can the programs and date be copied to a new computer?",?,"If you backed up your System and you rare running Premium version, you can restore it to a new computer using Restore Anywhere feature."
9032,yes/no,B00EFRMDW2,will this program clone copy from old hdd to brand new hard drive completely windows and all?,Y,"Yes, I have done that. I installed the new hard drive in the second drive location in the computer box. Then all you have to do is run the clone process. After that completed I moved the drive C: cable to the new drive and removed the old drive from the box. I recommend saving the old drive in case of a failure in the new drive (it happened to me)."
9033,open-ended,B00EFRMDW2,How do you only move Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit from my HDD to a SSD using Acronis 2104. I want my SSD to be my boot drive and my data to be on my HHD.,,"I personally found Actonis to be significantly less than useful. Was a poor purchase decision. As far as migration / upgrade of HDD size or types, I simply used windows back-up to create an image on my 3TB external Seagate HDD and a recovery DVD set. Then I did my drive swap, made sure my PC had the DVD as an alternate boot drive and then booted from the recovery DVDs. Piece of cake, albeit a lengthy process."
9034,yes/no,B00EFRMDW2,Will this software let me clone my entire Windows 7 HP Pavilion laptop to a 3 TB Toshiba external drive?,?,"I believe so. I have cloned many drives to 500gb, 750gb and 1 terabyte drives using acronis software"
9035,yes/no,B00EFRMDW2,do i need to reactivate winows once I restore from the image?,N,No
9036,open-ended,B00EFRMDW2,Is the Acronis CD bootable? Can I just boot to the Acronis OS and then have it clone my hard drive to a DVD? (I don't want to have to install Acronis),,"Yes, you can MAKE a bootable CD, but for cloning only, why would you want to? If you only want to clone a hard drive, rather pay for a backup program, you can just get a cloning program. Also, if you ever want to replace one or more files, it is much easier and faster to restore those only from a backup set."
9037,yes/no,B00EFRMDW2,"I have some old .tib files that I'd like to recover files from (not restore a full system, just extract some files). Does this allow me to do this?",N,No
9038,yes/no,B00EFRMDW2,Can just back up programs and data (no os) from an XP and restore to Win 7 os.,Y,"You may be able backup the programs only if you know where everything is (Registry entries, Initialization files along with all needed executable/dat files). It wouldn't be a clean install though. I recommend reinstalling the programs on Win 7. As for the Data it will work just fine. Once you have backed up all your data and reinstalled everything, restore your data on the clean system. Then create a new backup with everything (Data and Win 7). It's actually easier than it sounds (the recommended way that is!). I hope this helps."
9039,yes/no,B00EFRMDW2,Can I also retrieve individual files?,?,"Mark, the only way I use Acronis is to clone the entire C drive to an external/portable drive. If I have a problem/crash/corruption, then I clone back. I suppose you could connect the clone (via usb) again and do an explorer search for individual files. Hope it helps. V"
9040,yes/no,B00EFRMBA6,"Can you save a ""complete"" backup of everything, including OS, guts, feathers and all to a backup drive?",Y,"yes, and when it's time to restore, you just boot to the resovery CD and it recovers everything to point in time, everything. So, if your hard drive goes dead, you just plug in a new one and boot to recovery and off you go. If you get a new PC you can recover just your data to the new PC. I think the premium version even allows you to do total restores to dissimilar hardware. BTW I just went to the site, there is a presales chat that will answer anything"
9041,open-ended,B00EFRMBA6,Is the Family Pack a time resticted license or a lifetime license?,,"I trust it is lifetime. You get three license numbers to use as you please. Of course, in time, this version of Acronis may not work with whatever new versions of Windows that will come out. However this version is good with Windows 8, and Windows 8 should be in use for a few years. The version is also backwards compatible with version 7."
9042,yes/no,B00EFRMBA6,Can You restore to a different drive with the Acronis True Image 2014 Family Pack?,Y,"Hi James. the answer is definitely yes. I have done it with Acronis many times both with this version and previous ones. How you do it depends on what you are setting out to do e.g replacing a drive in an existing desktop PC, replacing a drive in a laptop or transferring a drive image to a different desktop or laptop. Recently I swapped the 1tb hard drive in my laptop for a 1tb hybrid drive (i.e. one with a small solid state drive that speeds up boot up by storing frequently used programs in the SSD pat of the drive) Acronis worked a treat to do this. In this case I used a usb docking station to plug the new drive in and used the disk migrate tool in Acronis - i.e. running Acronis from within Windows. This then made an exact copy on to the new drive. Once done I swapped them round and presto thanks to Acronis (and Seagate hybrid drive) I now have a laptop that boots up really fast. The ld drive I put into an external enclose and is now used a an external back up drive for the laptop using Acronis for the drive backups! Some procedures need you to create the disk image and save to an external hard drive then create an Acronis boot disk on CD or memory stick and boot from that and run the restore from the external drive as source and new drive as target. It is very flexible in how you can restore or copy one drive to another. In short I can heartily recommence this- I have been using it for several years now and its worth every penny esp when a drive has gone wrong or a software install has messed things up. If you need advice on a particular scenario Id be glad to help. Hope this helps."
9043,open-ended,B00EFRMBA6,"1) Can the backed up user data files be viewed in regular Windows Explorer or do you need to use Acronis to view backed up files? Many backup programs create user file/folder backups in PROPRIETARY file formats. 2) If this does file ""synchronization"",...",,With Acronis 2014 you have an option to mount a image. This lets you look and copy files and documents you need in a windows Explorer setting that your familiar with. It is a very unique option and I just tried it to make sure it works. It worked fine and was able to read and copy documents that I might need.
9044,yes/no,B00EFRMBA6,"Can you backup the same computer to two different external drives, so you would have 2 backups?",Y,"Yes. Each backup type (i.e., different drive) requires a different ""script"" and you can create as many scripts as you want. I backup to one internal drive and two external drives."
9045,yes/no,B00EFRMBA6,"Does the software do continuous backup? Every time you change a file, it gets immediately backed up.",?,"All depends on your setting. If you set it to do continuous backup, t will back up everytime there is a change. You can set thethe programm to back up every time you shut down the computer or once a day at a specific time."
9046,yes/no,B00EFRMBA6,"When creating image and saving on ext hd, do I have to erase the ext hd first? I'd rather not. I'd like to save images from 3 PCs to 1 ext hd.",N,No. Backup images are stored as files. The only reason to delete files is to free up hard drive space.
9047,yes/no,B00EFRMBA6,"My HP Win 7 laptop is warning of an imminent HD failure. Can I copy the HD to an ext SATA drive, &amp; then install that HD to the PC?",Y,yes
9048,yes/no,B00EFRMBA6,"With the True Image Family Pack, can I use the license on different PCs, such as my PC, my office PC, etc",?,The Family Pack gives you 3 licenses one for each PC or laptop
9049,open-ended,B00EFRMBA6,what is the difference between Acronis 2014 Premium with 3 licenses and Acronis True Image 2014 Family pack?,,"Family pack is the normal True image than can be installed on 3 devices. It enables you to restore to same PC or laptop from which it was backed up either to the same disk (if the system got corrupted) or to a replacement disk (or SSD) in the case of a failed disk drive replacement or swapping out for a larger disk or SSD. Premium has the added feature of enabling a restore to a different PC i.e,. if you have upgraded the motherboard etc. it will restore then find and install all the needed drivers for the new hardware. It used to be a add-on to the normal version. I has this and used it a couple of times and it worked reasonably well but still needed so me tweaking of drivers. If you don't plan to change hardware then the family pack will work fine. Even if after using family pack and you have hardware failure (motherboard etc) or switch to a new PC the family pack version will work top do a disk restore to the new pc/laptop and Windows will normally download the needed hardware drivers- or you might need a bit of manual tweaking. I did this successfully last year on a replacement laptop and it worked fine using the normal(family pack) version and running Windows in safe mode then updating hardware drivers. Remember though that whatever version you use, if the drive image is to different hardware either new PC/Laptop or different motherboard& processor it will be necessary for Windows to be re-activated as it will detect these changes. Sometimes it will do this without problem - sometimes it will thow up an error message. However in my experience in the latter case i have found Microsoft support very helpful in de-activating the old installation and allowing re-activation on the new hardware. Hope this helps"
9050,open-ended,B00EIU2BIW,Will this software be useful in redesigning or remodeling my home? Particularly the kitchen/laundry area with digital pics I can upload.,,Yes as far as redesigning and helping to plan not sure on uploading pics

This is the same security software we use at my office, so I thought I would give it a try at home and so far I am very pleased with its performance.

9095,open-ended,B00ENFYLOO,i was reading in some of the reviews that they bought this antivirus and did not get the full year because of the date purchused is this true,,"You should get a full year, no matter when you purchase it. I think I got mine in March 2014 and it is good until March 2015. Hope this helps."
9096,open-ended,B00ENFYLRQ,I have used the Trend products for 2 yrs. Is it cheaper to just buy the newer version? Or go for the online renewal for ease of use,,"Online renewal is $49.95. We've been using the product for years, but I had problems with the online renewal, so I found it cheaper and easier to just buy the disc. This is a good price here, this year anyway, and with Prime you get it in a couple days anyway. Hope this helps."
9097,open-ended,B00ENFYLRQ,How do you install this on a Samsung S3 and Nexus 7,,If I remember correctly you go to Google play and download the free trial version. Then you go into the app and there should be a redeem section. Then you put in the code that came on the package of the cd
9098,open-ended,B00ENFYLRQ,"is this a disc or just a download, and how do you get the one you have off of your computer",,"Markland, the one I purchased was a disc. If I remember once you insert this disc into your drive, it asks you if you want to Uninstaller previous protection software."

9101,yes/no,B00ENFYLRQ,"Is this package compatible with all Apple and PC products, including Macbook, iPhone, iPad, Windows PC, &amp; Samsung Galaxy 3?",Y,Yes
9102,open-ended,B00ENFYLRQ,"What's the difference between the titanium maximum, the titanium maximum premium and the internet security?",,I have the titanium maximum premium it protects any software download on my computer as well as any files that come through internet. I am not sure what the difference is between the three of them I only have experience with the maximum premium. You would probably have to contact the manufacturer for a thorough explanation of what you are getting and the difference between the 3 of them.
9103,open-ended,B00ENFYLRQ,"it this the 5 user version of the Trend Micro MAXIMUM Premium 2014 ad does not say if 1, 3 or 5 users thanks",,"The premium version is for 5 users as seen on the picture. Thanks,"
9104,yes/no,B00ENFVLAQ,My McAfee viral program is expiring in March 2014. Do I need a viral program for my Mac and XP with the Parallels 9?,Y,I have found it unnecessary to install an anti-virus program if I am running Windows through Parallels. I do all of my web surfing through Safari on my Mac and therefore bypass the vulnerabilities of IE in Windows.
9105,open-ended,B00ENFVLAQ,"I have trial version of 9 installed. can I just buy &amp; enter activation key, or do I need to reinstall this?",,All I had to do was enter the activation code to the existing installation.

9107,open-ended,B00ENFVLAQ,"I'm unclear - is this a download? With a physical key that arrives in the mail? The description says ""no disk.""",,This is a download. You set up an account online. Your product purchases and activation keys are stored in your account. You are notified by email regarding access to your activation key.
9108,open-ended,B00ENFVLAQ,"If I install this product, do I then get Microsoft Office for Mac or do I install the regular Microsoft Office suite that I would install on a PC?",,you need a full paid version of windows
9109,open-ended,B00ENFVLAQ,"If I order it, how will I give the activation code? Will Amazon send me a printed code by post? Or I will give it by email?",,I ordered my copy from another online retailer. The activation code was included in an email from that retailer. I would think Amazon would handle it the same way but this is just a guess on my part.
9110,yes/no,B00ENFVLAQ,does it run acceptably on imac mid 2008,Y,I have an iMac but am not certain what year I got it. But I had to upgrade to 4 gigs (I couldn't add more than that) and buy the windows program to go with it. I have been as happy with it as with any new computer workings. My iMac sometimes runs slow and I must delete temp files etc to keep it efficient.
9111,open-ended,B00ENFVLAQ,How to make Partitions,,"Same as previous poster. Each virtual drive is saved as a file that can be transferred from one hard drive to another just like an document file or a picture file. You can set the size and resize as needed should your initial virtual drive not be big enough. For instance, I'm running my copy of Win 7 Ultimate (32 bit since I don't have/need more than 3-4GBs of RAM to run everything I need in the virtual machine) as my virtual drive. Parallels allows you to completely customize how integrated your virtual machine is with your main OS (Mac OS X). I have it set so that I can access my Mac's drives (internal and external) and swap files all I want, and I can even directly access a word file on my OSX's desktop directly in my virtual machine which is where I've got MS Word. There shouldn't be any need whatsoever to use multiple partitions in the virtual machine since you can just add another virtual drive or repartition your home machine and access it through Parallel's file sharing options."
9112,open-ended,B00ENFVLAQ,Is this box version? Or just activation key?,,"Activation key, but the link to the download site is included."

9138,yes/no,B00ENFVSIQ,"Will Willmaker Plus alert me to ways of minimizing estate tax, depending on the size of my estate, state of residence, etc.?",?,"It only explains the process to you in the Legal Manual included in the software. I will see if I can include a quote from the Manual here: "" State taxes normally do not take a deep enough bite to cause serious concern unless your estate is large. However, because of recent changes to federal and state tax laws, an increasing number of estates owe some state tax. (Some estates may have to pay state tax even if they aren't large enough to owe federal estate tax.) If you own a lot of property-say, more than $1 million worth-and you're concerned about it, you may want to check with an estate planning or tax lawyer who can bring you up to date on the laws in your state."" Hope this helps."
9139,yes/no,B00ENFVSIQ,Can you do a joint will with this product?,?,"Here's what the FAQs and Support section of the program says: ""Can I use WillMaker to make a joint will with my spouse? No, each of you must make your own will, even if you both agree about how your property is to be distributed. There is solid legal reasoning behind this rule. Joint wills are intended to prevent the surviving spouse from changing his or her mind about what to do with the property after the first spouse dies. The practical effect is to tie up the property for years and make it impossible for the surviving spouse to react to changed circumstances. Also, many court battles are fought over whether the surviving spouse can revoke any part of the joint will. That's why joint wills are very uncommon these days. If you want to restrict how your property can be used after your death, or make special provisions for children from a prior marriage, using a trust is usually a better solution; see a lawyer for specifics. You and your spouse can easily create identical wills -- that is, two separate wills in which all the provisions (such as beneficiaries and children's guardians) are the same. If you want to do this, look for the button provided on the Congratulations screen at the end of the will interview."""

I bought this to replace Kaspersky, and within hours I was impressed at the amount of viruses , Trojans, and malware that Bitedefender removed. And it doesn't slow your computer or laptop down like Norton 360 did to mine. Overall I give this a 10 out of 10 stars and will only purchase Bitedefender products.

9224,open-ended,B00EOI2SR2,Can this program be installed on 2 machines or just 1? Both my husband and I would like to use it on our laptops so wanted to make sure before purchas,,"You receive a license for one computer. However, the EULA states that you may load this program on up to 3 computing devices at one address, and can only be used one at time. Example (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet). You are not allowed to operate the program on more than (l) machine at a time. You would need to purchase a second license it you had a need to operate both at the same time."
9225,yes/no,B00EOI2SR2,"Can this program ""stitch"" several photos together to make a panaramic picture?",?,"I highly recommend you search for and try a program called Hugin to create panorama's. Hugin is free. The interface is a bit rough, but the results have always been very good for me and I always let it automate the stitching without me changing anything."
9226,open-ended,B00EOI2SR2,I already have Lightroom. How is this different? Is it worth buying for me?,,"PSP is more like Photoshop than Lightroom. It supports layers, which is the big divide. If you are interested in using layers, PSP would make sense unless you decided to do the subscription thing with Adobe. The raw converter from Adobe is better than PSP's raw converter, so you might want to do your initial editing in Lightroom and your more advanced editing, if necessary, in PSP. BTW, PSP supports most (but not all) Photoshop plugins. AIUI, the ones with the .8bf extension will work. I use the Topaz suite and Focus Magic with PSP. FWIW"
9227,yes/no,B00EOI2SR2,"It says in the description ""more than just photo editing, it's also a powerful design program"". Can I make a decent FB cover or design custom blog photos with this, do you think?",?,"It's up to your imagination in what you can do by using layering to move objects from one photo to another, or just remove objects. It's by far the best bang for the buck, make sure you get the ultimate and when you load it, do both the 32 and 64 bit version as there are many existing tools that only run on 32 bits that you can import, you can even import Adobe images. I extracted a red rose from a bush, and filled the background in black after changing the rose to soft white, came out beautiful. Best of all, there are both text and video help for the tools even on youtube. It will take time to learn and I recommend taking notes when you do something, saves effort next time you try it. Enjoy"
9228,open-ended,B00EOI2SR2,How does this compare to Lightroom 5? I'm debating on which one to get. I've only tried the trial with Corel and read the reviews and it's supposed to be slower than Lightroom.,,"PaintShop Pro is Corel's answer to Photoshop. If you want a competitor to Lightroom, that would be Corel's AfterShot Pro. FWIW"
9229,yes/no,B00EOI2SR2,I just bought Corel PaintShop Pro X6. It seems very overwhelming to me. Is this for professionals -- not amateurs?,?,"Try using the ADJUST tab first, and avoid so-called ""EDIT"" mode. This pares down your options quite a bit. In addition start with the Smart Photo Adjust or whatever in adjust and look at how the recommended settings look. Then mess with the levers and knobs and see what all they do, and how they adjust the picture to get the look you want. Also, with Ultimate mode you can use their plugin that is bundled with it, which kind of does the same thing. Its meant for quickly doing basic improvements on a photo, with a few basic sliders that adjust settings."
9230,yes/no,B00EOI2SR2,"Will the Nik Effects plugin that came with Paintshop Pro x5 still work with this version, I'd hate to loose that.",?,"Since I don't use that software I can't be certain...based on Google Nik website its states Nik effects works with (don't see paintshop) *Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 *Adobe Photoshop CS4 through CS6 *Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 through 11 (apart from HDR Efex Pro 2, which is not compatible with Photoshop Elements) *Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 through 5"
9231,open-ended,B00EOI2SR2,What is the actual installation size of this program? Thank you very much for your help.,,"I did a Properties query on the C:\Program Files\Corel which showed 211 MB as Size On Disk, 242 Folders and 5,227 files."
9232,yes/no,B00EOI2SR2,"Can I merge photos, create collages, erase backgrounds with this software?",Y,"Yes, it does that very well."
9233,open-ended,B00EOI2SR2,How easy is it to email photos without waiting forever?,,"How easy is it to email or upload photos? First let's address the Corel Paintshop Pro software. If you have loaded any photos into Paintshop, at the bottom of the screen in the ""manage"" menu, you will see a submenu (looks like a two tined fork) called ""share"". You can click on one of your photos, or hold the shift key and click on several photos and an option screen comes up to upload them to Facebook, Flickr, or Google+, select the preferred one and it will upload to it. To send via your email, it's: Compose the email, click on the ""attach"" function (or whatever similar name in the specific email you use) find the photo in Windows usually in the ""Pictures file, click open and it will attach to the message. NOW about the upload ""taking forever"" has little or nothing to do with Corel Paint Shop, or much to do with the email you use. The upload speed/time is determined almost entirely by the speed of your internet connection and little else. So if you have slow internet speed it will take a long time to move megabits of photo data up to your internet provider, or to Facebook, or wherever. In brief: neither Corel PaintShop, nor your email provider, can make a slow internet connect move large amounts of photo zeros and ones upload any faster, since they are not the problem."
9234,yes/no,B00EOI2TD0,Can I make a business flyer with it? I want to use a JPEG as the background then put the wording over it with some smaller jpegs and then print on HP,?,"absolutely ... you can create any documents, graphics, fliers, brochures, posters, etc using any graphics as well as alphanumeric text from many formats (psp, psd, png, jpg, etc) and save the same. Suggestion: Save in 2 formats: (1) Save as .psd or .pspimage as your MASTER copy so that you are able to edit/revise if necessary. (2) For the copy that you are going to print, save as jpeg (jpg) or png. I usually save in png because the graphics/overall resolution is much crisper. End product is very professional! Good Luck! Hope this helps you! Gladi"
9235,yes/no,B00EOI2TD0,I have Windows 7 Professional. Will Corel PaintShop Pro X6 work with no problems downloading?,?,"I have the 64-bit version. As much as Win7 works at all, Corel in my hands adds no grief. There's a learning curve for all the sub-menus. I find the on-line manual is sloppy about explaining subtleties and interactions."
9236,yes/no,B00EOI2TD0,Will it work on Windows 8.1?,Y,"Yes, it works. The interface, though, is more like Photoshop."
9237,yes/no,B00EOI2TD0,Can I transform photos into images that simulate pen and ink drawiings?,Y,"Yes, there are many artistic tools built into the program."
9238,open-ended,B00EOI2TD0,Does this program have Vignette or soft focus settings?,,There are 10 soft focus settings as well as the option to custom modify any of them. There are 4 Vignette settings also with option to modify. This software offers a large selection of effects and image adjustments. The best way to access them all easily is with the effects browser.
9239,open-ended,B00EOI2TD0,For many years I have been using Corel Photo Paint 12 and have mastered it. Now it will not work on windows 8. How does this compare to Photo Paint 12 ? I hate learning new programs.,,"Wow, that's quite a question! I haven't done a detailed point-by-point comparison between PaintShop Pro and PhotoPaint, but my impression is that they are VERY different. If you're used to PhotoPaint, I think you've got a pretty steep learning curve ahead of you if you have to switch to PaintShop Pro. I've used PhotoPaint for many, many years. The version I have now is X5, which works fine (if slowly) on my Windows XP system. I rarely use PaintShop Pro simply because it is so different than what I'm used to using. If PhotoPaint 12 really doesn't work on Windows 8, that seems like a very bad marketing decision on the part of Corel. Do you have the option of upgrading to the latest version of PhotoPaint, or at least one that DOES work on your system? My bottom line: PhotoPaint and PaintShop Pro are as different as night and day, in my opinion. If I were you and if I were concerned about learning a new program, I'd stick with PhotoPaint if at all possible. Hope this helps."
9240,yes/no,B00EOI2TD0,will this software work on windows 7 professional?,Y,"That's the same windows that I have on my computer and it's works great for me. I have done extensive work using this program, and I admit I'm still learning more all the time on what to do and what to try to do, I love it."
9241,open-ended,B00EOI2TD0,Does this have a simple way to cut out part of a photo and paste it onto another? e.g. Add smiling face over frowning face?,,"I'm sorry, but I haven't installed this yet. I'm still using Corel 4 and I haven't found out how to paste a photo onto another. I would think that Photoshop or Photoshop Elements might be better for that task. I use Corel for painting."
9242,yes/no,B00EOI2TD0,Can I create avatars and change images to 300 dpi for publishing?,Y,"Yes, you can. You need to know what format your environment wants for an avatar, and of course what size. With dpi/publishing, you need to start with the high dpi if you possibly can. If you're using a scanner, set the scan to your target dpi (300 in this case). You can shrink things easily, but expanding things (including raising the dpi) you have to watch out for resulting blurriness. There are adjustments you can then do, but you're better off starting with the high dpi from the get-go. (This is true for all image software, by the way.)"
9243,yes/no,B00EOI2TD0,"Can ""Paint Shop Pro X6"" create small graphics in "".ICO"" format (icons).",Y,"Yes, Corel Paint Shop Pro X6 can create graphics in .ico format"

9246,yes/no,B00EOI2SYK,I want to add music to my projects and then create a DVD to display my photos on my TV. Can I do this with this software?,Y,"Yes, you can."
9247,open-ended,B00EOI2SYK,With videos can I use my own music in the background? And with photos can I edit objects out of the shot? Thanks,,"According to the Manual, yes to both questions; Object Extractor - The enhanced Object Extractor makes it easy to cut objects out of extra-large image files, thanks to new 64-bit performance. Use it to perform a number of tasks on your large files, such as removing an object from its original background or copying an extracted image and placing it in a different photo. Corel VideoStudio Pro allows you to add both narration and music to your project. The Audio feature in Corel VideoStudio Pro consists of two tracks: Voice and Music. You can insert narration on the Voice Track and background music or sound effects on the Music Track.

Thanks! :),?,"Not sure what you're asking but if you mean does it have templates, then yes it does and quite a few, plus add-ons. It does a ""Quick Edit"" as well as a quick movie/video and allows you to create your own templates. I hope this helps."

9252,yes/no,B00EOI2SYK,Does it have live screen capture - for example for capturing youtube videos?,?,It doesn't do that. it is intended to create your own videos mixing or using any kind of video format.
9253,open-ended,B00EOQZB32,Can you do more with the audio files other than adjust the volume and start/stop points? Can you cut/copy parts of a song to make them shorter/longer?,,"Yes you can. You you can cut from either end, and put in any section of any tack anywhere within that track, and fade in and out to flow/smooth it all out nicely. I believe you can have multiple tracks also. I have not used it as much as I'd like, but from what I have found you can do almost anything your mind is capable of creating. The biggest problem with the music was the files it ""accepts""...WAV and mp3...which my itunes library is not compatible, so I had to burn a playlist of the songs from itunes that I wanted, and rip them back into windows media player as a WAV file and save it to a folder THEN I could use them in Premier, also the photos and video files had to be shrunk down(you are usually working with quite a few at a time) so they don't crash the program, which is easy to do in Photoshop Elements, so buy them both, if you can there are some nice little ""tools"" that play off of each other, usually they will sell the two at a reduced price. I also bought ""The Muvipix.com Guide to Premier Elements""- it is a pretty good book to have as all of Adobe seems to be not so ""user friendly"". :)"

9273,open-ended,B00EP7AQ4O,"When the trial membership is up, do I lose all the information that I found/gained or will it save/keep it in my file?",,Not if you maintain the information in a local PC file rather than working through Ancestry.com's site. Use the product and keep the files to yourself on your PC and you won't lose anything.
9274,open-ended,B00EP7AQ4O,If I purchase a more current version of FTM will I be able to retrieve the info I have saved from FTM win95/98?,,"Just go to your new version of FTM and click on open and then on your old data for family tree it will automatically update what you have to the new version, might also ask you a few questions if this is what you want to do and of course you do."
9275,open-ended,B00EP7AQ4O,"Does this program work if you never sync to Ancestry.com? And if you do sync but then cancel your membership, do you ""lose"" any info?",,"I have used this product for over 10 years and have never synced with Ancestry.com (my privacy concerns). The files are maintained locally and I keep a backup on a separate removable device. I establish and use the membership, cancelling in the month to limit financial exposure, and then reestablish a membership later when I need it. I have never found this to cause me to lose information, as the files are maintained locally on my PC."
9276,open-ended,B00EP7AQ4O,Windows 8.1 compatibility?,,"I am not sure. I installed it on Windows 8 and it worked--a little glitchy on occasion but it worked. I then upgraded to and had nothing but problems. Not only would this not work but neither would a lot of other programs (and I have a brand new decked out HP laptop picked out by an IT pro). Anyway, so I reinstalled 8 and it all works good again. I would just make sure to back up EVERY TIME you use the program."
9277,open-ended,B00EP7AQ4O,how well does the upgrade work from version 2008?,,"Do not waste your money. Need I say more! Purchased the online upgrade CD not the download. When I got it it did not work on three computers Running W 7 64 bit. Had to Install manualy and Thank God I only tried one and did a backup before i did. Still did not work, Hung up, freezes, would not upload media etc. Downloaded patch and got worse to the point of the dreaded BLUE SCREEN. SCARY! Sent it back asked for refund and got refund two months later after several emails. So, decided to try a STORE Bought version $80.00 thinking perhaps it would be better. Installed just fine but media took forever and still hung up and frezes. So thru it back to. I have been a user of FTM and a subscriber to Ancetsry since 1993. This is the first time a software has had so many issues. One more thing, did not see much difference between 2012 version and new version other than it is more color coded which you can do that with 2012 and you still can only sync to one computer. So will wait till they come up with more patches or a better software."
9278,open-ended,B00EP7AQ4O,"Does anyone know whether this is the 2014 or the 2013 version? Ancestry.com lists them by year of release, so calling it Deluxe doesn't help much.",,It says 2014 on the computer.
9279,open-ended,B00EP7AQ4O,"I copied my Broderbund FTM, files from XP onto a flash drive. If I install Nova's FTM, into win. 8, how do I install flash files into new program?",,"I had older copy of ftm that worked on my vista based computer,i tried to download it and retrive my olded files from the vista software to my wimdows 8 computer and it would not work I had to buy a newer version of FTM for the win.8 computer and copy of of the old files to a flash drive and copy into the new FTM software. Hope this helps gary"
9280,yes/no,B00EP7AQ4O,"I have a really old version of Broderbund's Family Tree Maker from 2003, Version 11. Are FBC and FTW files compatible with this program?",?,"If the Broderbund's program allows you to save the file as, or is convertible too, a gedcom file ( GEnealogical Data COMmunications format) then you should be able to import the file. Keep in mind though gedcom is a basic file, no media will be imported. From past experience you will also probably have some cleanup work to do once imported, but is the easiest way to convert. Converting one file format to another, or one program to another, has never gone as advertized, or has ever been glitched free for me."
9281,yes/no,B00EP7AQ4O,"Are there still a lot of bugs in this version? I am considering purchasing it, but am concerned after reading some reviews / questions. I thought it would be a good deal since it is less then 3 months subscription to ancestry.com and I would be owning...",Y,"I would say yes. I haven't been able to install 2014, getting numerous fails and errors and the customer service with ancestry is awful. If 2014 can't handle a simple installation then heaven know else would go wrong. I currently use the 2012 version and have been very happy with it. There s a lot of great upgrades in 2012 that i found helpful (I had upgraded from 2008 to 2012). I'm attempting to get my money back for the 2014 and will stick with 2012."
9282,yes/no,B00EP7AQ4O,does this program work with Ipad,?,"Virginia, As long as you have the proper O/S (operating system) and space you should be good to go."
9283,yes/no,B00EP7AQBC,Is the free month on ancestry.com limited to the U.S. Discovery databases or does it include the World Explorer international records?,?,Just the US. If you also want to subscribe to the World membership you pay the difference between the two. Call the Ancestry customer service 800# and they will work it out for you. You cannot do this just on the web site.
9284,open-ended,B00EP7AQBC,"what is the difference between family tree maker ""Essentials,"" ""Deluxe"", and ""Platinum"" aside from the length of time of the membership?",,"I looked this up for you. Carol Difference between Family Tree Maker software editions The Family Tree Maker software line is a popular product that comes in four versions. It can be a little difficult to figure out what's best for your needs, so we've created a guide to help you decide. Family Tree Maker comes in Essentials, Standard, Deluxe and Collector's Editions (listed in order of price). The Family Tree Maker software is the same between ALL of the versions. The only differences between the Essentials, Standard, Deluxe and Collector's Edition are the length of the included Ancestry subscription and the included exclusive bonus items. Let's break it down! Ancestry Subscription: Essentials: 3 months included Standard: 6 months included Deluxe: 9 months included Collector's: 12 months (1 year) included Keep in mind that the Ancestry subscription begins from the time of registration, and is usually for new subscriptions only. You may be able to extend an existing subscription, but that usually requires that you contact the Ancestry support team and ask. Exclusive Bonus Items: Each higher version includes the bonus items from the previous version. Essentials Edition includes: 30-minute Introductory Genealogy Consultation Official Family Tree Maker Training DVD Official Family Tree Newsletter 3 months Ancestry subscription Standard Edition includes: Everything from the Essentials Edition Family Tree Workbook Genealogy Dictionary Additional 3 months on your Ancestry subscription (6 months total) Deluxe Edition includes: Everything from the Essentials Edition Everything from the Standard Edition Historical Documents of your Ancestors Historical Maps & Images Collection Images & Photos Collection Reference Library GenSmarts for MyFamily.com Additional 3 months on your Ancestry subscription (9 months total) Collectors Edition includes: Everything from the Essentials Edition Everything from the Standard Edition Everything from the Deluxe Edition The Official Guide to Family Tree Maker Additional 3 months on your Ancestry subscription (12 months total)"
9285,open-ended,B00EP7AQBC,"Does this include stand-alone Family Tree software that will run independently on my computer, or does it just sync with Ancestry?",,"You can use it by itself, but it will only have the data you input. I have mine set to auto sync with Ancestry so that either will update the other. Then if I am somewhere without internet, like a small county courthouse, I can do my research, input it on my laptop, and sync it later."
9286,yes/no,B00EP7AQBC,Can I use this to update a 95/98 Edition?,Y,"Don't remember the 95/98 edition, but if you can export in GEDCOM format then you can import it into this version. WIth this format you loose the pictures you might have input but all the the relationships and data are there. bye."
9287,yes/no,B00EP7AQBC,will I be able to import the file from my old version?,Y,"Yes! Simply export your file using the export link, save it directly to your new program. Make sure you include all notes, photos and documents (the progrM will ask if you wish to include thse) and your new program will then have everything includex! I had no problems with this. Also check out the HELP function. This will walk you through it step by step."
9288,yes/no,B00EP7AQBC,Does the Family Tree software allow for different font sizes?,Y,"Yes! Go to Tools, then click on Options. You will find many options and one is to change font size. Hope this helps."
9289,yes/no,B00EP7AQBC,I would like to save my descendant chart to a one page PDF. I currently have the 2008 version and it won't let me. Will this version do that?,?,"Yes, FTM 2014 enables you to export your chart in a PDF format and a One Page PDF. Once you create your chart on the Publish Workspace, click on the Share Icon on the upper right and you are given those two choices and more. --- Joe L"
9290,yes/no,B00EP7AQBC,"I realize you can ""build"" a family tree and upload it to Ancestry.com. Can you download the info you've built on Ancestry.com to this product?",?,"You won't need to do a manual download, Ancestry.com will do that for you when you open your Family Tree Maker on your computer. The two data bases (Ancestry.com and FTM) will ""sync"" up with each other automatically. When you add data to FTM it will sync with Amcestry.com when you exit the program. When you go online and add data to Ancestry.com it will sync up the next time you open the FTM program on your computer. You can also download your family tree from Ancestory.com and FTM into a GEDCOM file that can be uploaded to other genealogy programs and websites."
9291,yes/no,B00EP7AQBC,Can I use this to update my 2011 edition?,?,"It does not write over your prior version, but if you are using Ancestry.com when you sync everything is going to load onto your your 2014 version."
9292,yes/no,B00EP7AQBC,is it compatable with Windows 8?,Y,Yes
9293,open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,What is the benefit of having this software over merely being an ancestry member and having trees online?,,"I don't have this particular version, but I have had Family Tree Maker in the past and I've been an Ancestry member since 2008. There are several benefits to using the software over just having an on-line tree. The first is that except for images you find ON ANCESTRY, chances are that for ANY other image you will first download it to your computer and at some time in the future MAYBE upload it to Ancestry. This allows you to have that in your tree immediately, whether you ever upload it or not. Second, often there is information you don't want to put on-line. It may be personal information (I found two relatives who are registered sex offenders . . .), or it may be information that is insignificant (a single line in an old newspaper mentioning that my grandmother played a piano piece at a music teacher's recital). It might also be information that some hotheaded relative will raise hell about even though it doesn't involve them. Third, you may have LOADS of information and only want to put some of it online. I downloaded the ENTIRE high school yearbooks of two of my aunts and my grandmother. Nobody wants to have to wade through 225 pages PER yearbook, so I put excerpts. (Lest you think that sounds weird . . . I also found two cousins' yearbook and downloaded those, and scanned my high school yearbook, my brother's yearboook, my junior year yearbook, two junior high yearbooks, and some of my law school yearbooks. But I digress ...) Fourth, with pictures of documents, they really aren't much use to most people unless they are transcribed, so they'll be searchable. You might not want spend time transcribing since you can just read the document. Also, these programs generally have more options about print layout, etc. Ancestry has to aim for ""the lowest common denominator"" -- folks who upload a few photos, search for and find a few census records, and move on. Beginners and ""short termers"" aren't going to spend $100 on genealogy software and folks who do are going to learn how to use it. There are also more options for storing, uploading and transferring information. Anyone serious about genealogy quickly learns that each generation of a tree quickly expands ""laterally"" -- first brothers and sisters, then spouses of brothers and sisters, then brothers and sisters of the spouses, then spouses of THOSE brothers and sisters, etc. On Ancestry, if you ""copy"" a person to another tree, it only transfers MINIMAL information. It DOESN'T transfer all the residence entries, the source entries, etc. So if you want to MOVE someone to a new tree or COPY that person to a tree, you have to manually move/copy all the other entries."
9294,open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,Will Ancestry automatically upload my records or does it have to ask for permission before it can do that?,,"You can choose to NOT have automatic syncing, which is what I always do. There is a button that says Sync Now, and information shows the sync conditions of both your desktop and ancestry.com trees. (I also disable automatic backups in FTM2014 but perform a manual backup before doing any Sync Now.)"
9295,open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,Can this software be moved from one PC to another? What if I have it then need a new laptop? Anyone have experience moving it to new PC?,,"According to the Family Tree Maker section of the Help section at ancestry.com, you should be able to install FTM on two computers. There is a toll-free number you can call if you have any problems."
9296,open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,"If I purchase the platinum which comes with 6 months membership for US only, and want to upgrade to international membership, how is that done?",,"***Disgusting***I bought this package thinking that if I needed to I could upgrade from USA to World for the difference in cost of the two. I called their help line and was told they did not upgrade the ""free"" time part of my package and I would need to pay full price if I wanted to upgrade. I think something is amiss here! This is not my only complaint about Ancestry.com. ***Update:*** After reviewing written documentation and carefully considerating issues like false advertising I tried calling their help line again. This time the person helping me checked with a superior and said yes I would get a discount for upgrading. It only cost a little less than ten dollars a month for a six month upgrade. At least this problem is hopefully solved now."
9297,open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,What is the Difference between the Platinum and the Delux Family Tree Makers,,"The Platinum Edition has six months of Ancestry.com included, as opposed to three with the Deluxe Edition, and also comes with ""The Companion Guide To Family Tree Maker,"" a 300+ page printed user guide that includes research tips."
9298,open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,I am already a member of ancestry. Am I still entitled to 6 months free? How do I get that?,,"Yes, you will get 6 months of the US (not the World) membership for free. You have to call the 800# (800-262-3787) and talk to a very nice customer service rep. If you are already a World member, the cost of the US membership will be subtracted from what you owe. I believe you must already have the new software installed on your computer and registered prior to requesting this offer."
9299,yes/no,B00EP7AP7C,"I do not have a CD-ROM drive on my laptop. If I purchase FTM 2014, can I download the install instead of using the CD?",Y,Yes you can get it as a down load directly from ancestry.com ( http://www.ancestry.com/cs/apps/products )
9300,open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,what is the difference between Deluxe and Platinum besides price? What additional features are in Platinum?,,"The Platinum Edition has six months of Ancestry.com included, as opposed to three with the Deluxe Edition, and also comes with ""The Companion Guide To Family Tree Maker,"" a 300+ page printed user guide that includes research tips."
9301,open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,So will all my data be saved on my computer or will it only be on the website?,,All your family information is saved in the location of your choice. Default is the installation drive. A copy of your data can be stored on the Ancestry website if you choose to sync and share your information with them.
9302,yes/no,B00EP7AP7C,Will this version work with Win 7?,Y,Yes. It works well
9303,open-ended,B00EPACNPQ,How does this compare to American Greetings Create a card? Windows 7? Easy to use?,,I have used American Greetings create a card for over 20 years and was very sad to hear it was no longer available for Windows 7. I bought the Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe and have found it to be as good as or even better than the American Greetings Create a card software. The address book and calendar are almost identical and also have a pop-up to let you know an occasion is coming up for a card. Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe is great!
9304,open-ended,B00EPACNPQ,How does Deluxe compare to standard version,,"Have used both the basic and deluxe versions. I have found over the years that any of the deluxe versions of card s/w is worth every penny as there are more options as well as more cards. I literally created hundreds of cards per year, so options in design, wording, and creativity are appreciated greatly. As I said in my review of Hallmark's product, the upgrades with their many malfunctions are troublesome; but it the user can get past those problems, usage of the s/w is enjoyable."
9305,yes/no,B00EPACNPQ,Can I print 4x5 invitations with this software?,Y,Yes. the software will set you up for a 4X5 size; then it's up to your printer to print that size.
9306,yes/no,B00EPACNPQ,can you create half circle text,Y,Yes you can with the edit buttons
9307,yes/no,B00EPACNPQ,"Does this also work for printing note cards 4 1/4"" x 5 1/2""",?,"I have not tried it for that. Honestly, I was very disappointed with the poor resolution when I printed a folded full card that I have not used it since. My intent was to create the cards and then send to UPS for professional color printing on card stock. The cards printed that way are only about $1.50 each so I thought it was a great alternative... but the quality just was not there... the wording was not crisp but rather blurred."
9308,yes/no,B00EPACNPQ,Will hallmark 2014 make calanders from scratch?,Y,"Yes they will. We are pleased with the Program, but it does take just a little practice for the first 3-4 cards, as the Onscreen TABS at the top are a little different than what you are used to in something like a Microsoft ""RIBBON"", and while the Printer capability is very extensive, we would like something in there to show what setup we have ""SAVED"" for a particular Printer. (It can do anything, but sometimes we forgot if we had 2-sided printing already set-up, and usually made a test print on blank paper to make sure."
9309,open-ended,B00EPACNPQ,"Says prints on inkjet printers, what about laser color printers?",,"The cards print beautifully on laser printers. I use laser because it bakes the ink, and it won't smudge like some ink jet printers"
9310,open-ended,B00EPACNPQ,I have a Gateway Vista..how do I get the 2014 to work. My cards wont print.,,I would do a full install of the program assuming you have enough available hard drive space. Next I hope you have an Intel Pentium 4 or faster. After that I have no magic advice. Hopefully your printer is appropriately installed to function with your computer. Printing a test page would confirm this. Sometimes it is confusing about Print or Print Now. Also sometimes you must configure your printer to make sure it prints things where they should be and in the proper orientation. There is a configure your printer now button. As I said--I have no magic. Check these things out and if necessary contact Tech Support as suggested on page 34 of your Quick Start Guide. I hope this helps. My wife and I LOVE this program.
9311,open-ended,B00EPACNPQ,"i HAVE 2014 &amp; 2015 Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe &amp; I am unable to put my name on back where it says card made for yoou by me , I have had the 2009 versi",,"On the back of the card you click on the words you want to delete, then right click and hit DELETE. Then you click on TEXT on the left side and write what you want. You can move that text around by clicking on it. Hope this helps."
9312,yes/no,B00EPACNPQ,Will this work on Windows 7 ?,?,We are using Windows 8. Should be no problem with W7 - and I'm sure that was specified in the product information.
9313,yes/no,B00EPACNUG,can you make a 5 x7 card with this software?,Y,"yes, 5 x 7 and about 50 other sizes from a pull-down in the menu when you go to print screen."
9314,open-ended,B00EPACNUG,compatable with windows 8.1?,,yes
9315,yes/no,B00EPACNUG,does this version have a template to print messages inside the card,?,"You can design any card, at the end of the project when print is clicked you have the option on single sheet (A4) single fold or double fold. So you can have single sheet printed one or both sodded, single fold across the width with project printed on either or both sides or a double fold, is you end up with a card one sister the size of you paper with print on all four of the pages You fold the paper after printing a flat a4 sheet To answer the question, yes you can print on the inside and outside of a project you make. Happy craft construction...."
9316,yes/no,B00EPACNUG,Does this version have the pop-up reminder program?,Y,"Yes, it does. It will remind you to check for updates!"
9317,yes/no,B00EPACNUG,do you have to go on line to print cards,?,"No, you don't have to go online to print or anything else for that matter. I have used Hallmark for years and bought new ones every few years, love it and fun to personalize the cards. Since cards are so expensive I have recouped my cost of the program and card paper a long time ago."
9318,yes/no,B00EPACNUG,Does it have a calendar?,?,"Yes, you can customize monthly, weekly and daily calendars. You can also include holidays and special events from your Event Planner."
9319,open-ended,B00EPACNUG,"What kind of paper does this print to? Can you use Avery or Hallmark, etc. as long as the sizes are correct (i.e any 5X7 paper for 5X7 cards)?",,I have used any card paper successfully
9320,yes/no,B00EPACNUG,Are the pictures copywrited so that I can copy the pictures out of Hallmark into The Print Shop for completing the process of making a card?,?,"By contacting Hallmark, you should get the answer to that question. The program does have an Export As PDF that will do that."
9321,open-ended,B00EPACNUG,"Does the 2014 version have new cards, or the same old ones, with just a couple new ones thrown in?",,I purchase Hallmark Card Studio usually every two years. The 2014 studio does have some new cards etc than my 2012.
9322,yes/no,B00EPACNUG,is it compatible with windows 8.1,?,I have windows 8 and I think 8.1 is basically the same.
9323,open-ended,B00EPACNBA,Hello Amazon Customers: Can you please tell me if the new Art Explosion Publisher Pro 3.0 saves your documents in the file formats (.npp) or (.ppp),,".npp, any type of picture, .pdf, and .pub files."
9324,open-ended,B00EPACNBA,how many computers can I install it on,,"I believe it's 3, as long as they are all registered to the same person and the same as the purchaser."
9325,open-ended,B00EPACNBA,Hello Amazon Customer: Can you please tell me if I can import all projects that was created with Art Publisher 1.0 in the new Art Publisher Pro 3 Pla,,"Hi Junie, coming from owning a tech support business for over 13 years I do not know why you can not import your Project Files over to the new version. Very difficult to find any place online that says you can't. I setup a ton of new computers for people and move their personal data files over to their new computers with very few problems. You are only moving project files over from a two generation old product so I do not see any problems there unless Nova Development changed their file format for their projects recently. I did not find any mention or come across Pro Publisher changing to a new file format for their publishing program. So I would highly doubt it here in your situation that you would not have any problems being able to bring your old Publisher Project files & import them into the new Publisher Pro 3.0 program."
9326,open-ended,B00EPACNBA,how many computers can use this? Or is this for a single PC,,It's for multiple PC's.
9327,open-ended,B00EPACO3M,I used an older version of print artist that allowed me to look through clip art alphabetically. I need to upgrade since newer computers don't take my old version. But I've read reviews that say newer versions of print artist do not order...,,"The only thing I can see that's alphabetized are the categories. If you search for a particular object, say ""daisy"" for example, it brings up a whole category and you have to do a visual search. I just got this program a short time ago and have not really used it, so there may be something I'm missing, but that's my experience so far."
9328,open-ended,B00EPACO3M,"How do I find the navigation tool bar when in the workplace using Windows 8.1? Uninstalled program, reinstalled. Still no tool bar. What now?",,I do not have Windows 8 - can't help you.
9329,open-ended,B00EPACO3M,how do I edit a print box in print artist platinum 25,,Haven't used it in several weeks. But I recall double-clicking anywhere in the text and the cursor then appears at the beginning. Should be intuitive from there.
9330,yes/no,B00EPACO3M,does it open older version files,?,"Myself don't have an older version of Print Artist, but P.A. does have the capabilities to import files from other similar programs. Hope that helps."
9331,yes/no,B00EPACO3M,Does this product work on windows 8.1?,Y,yes
9332,open-ended,B00EPACO3M,Do this software auto add holidays to calendars or do you have to infut in each cell?,,"We have made cards for Thank You, Sympathy, Get Well, Weddings, and Anniversaries and find the graphics files large and extensive. There a lot of categories and you should be able to find what you want. Plus you can import your own photos and graphics. We haven't made an actual calendar."
9333,yes/no,B00EPACO3M,is it definitely compatible with windows 8.1,Y,"It has worked with my Windows 8.1. I don't know whether it is finicky about the age of the computer, since mine is only a year old."
9334,yes/no,B00EPACO3M,Does it make newsletters?,Y,"Yes it has a project for Newsletters, calendars, cards, and many more."
9335,open-ended,B00EPACO3M,"I wish it would list all that you can make with it. Does it flyers, newsletters, or create letterheads? Any business type forms that I can create?",,"I've used it to make posters, but it has the ability to also make letterhead and newsletters - and most other stationery needs. It took some getting used to before I could effectively work with the text - practice makes perfect. I like Print Artist but I do not use it as much as Hallmark."
9336,open-ended,B00EPACO3M,Print Artist platinum How to make 25 graphics black &amp; white,,I do not know the answer for pa 25 At one time pa was a great graphics program. I my opinion they have trashed a very good program. They no longer furnish all of the graphics on the dvds. Other features have been lost. I own all of the old programs and NEVER again will I waste my money on them. I called them once and was told that you have to get the graphics online.
9337,yes/no,B00ESFEHPM,"I am interested in the Enterprise upgrade, are there required annual fees to QB once you purchase?",?,"No, there are no recurring fees for the software itself. Only if you have subscriptions within it for various things such as payroll, credit cards, etc."
9338,yes/no,B00ESFEHPM,We currently are on QuickBooks Pro 2005. Can I upgrade and import my data from QB Pro 2005?,?,"Wgpenguin, Yes you can. Gita Faust"
9339,open-ended,B00ESFEHPM,If I have version 11 will all my customers and accounts transfer over to the new version,,"Thank you for your question and ""Yes"" all of your existing lists and transactions should transfer into the latest version as long as there is no data damage. For good measure, we recommend that you run your QB data utilities and make a backup prior to updating your file to the newer version. Thanks again and have a Great Day!"
9340,yes/no,B00ESFEHPM,"DOes this incude the ""Contractor"" version?",Y,Yes it has all versions and you can toggle to any of them.
9341,yes/no,B00ESFEHPM,does this include the cd,Y,"Good Day Dennis, Yes, you will be provided with your license information from Intuit along with a Welcome Kit & Re-Install CD that will be shipped to you. We are all ex-Intuit Tier 3 Support Specialists who are here to help. If you make your QB Enterprise purchase through us at A+SalesCentral we can offer you up to (2) free hours of installation support with your purchase to assist you in getting up and running as smoothly as possible. Thank you for your question and have a great day!"

I doubt if it will import anything but wouldn't it be nice if a comma delimited file might work if someone developes an overseer program.
9349,open-ended,B00ESFEWCA,How many checking accounts can be out into the starter edition?,,I have 5 accounts and I don't think there is a maximum number of accounts stated anywhere. If I had 20 more accounts it looks like starter edition would handle them just fine. Don

9358,open-ended,B00EVVO1DG,Which PrintMaster works with windows 8.1? I've seen bad reviews on all versions.,,"Hi Sandra, I love Printmaster and when I upgraded to Windows 8.1, I found that Printmaster 18.1 would not run on the new Windows platform. Through much research I was advised to download and install Net Framework 1.1 and all would be well, not so. I then purchased PM Plat. 6.0, believing that this newer version would be the answer, not so. I have had crashes in the middle of projects losing hours of work, I am extremely frustrated to say the least. I have been using PM for many years and it has always been head and shoulders in performance above the rest. I sincerely hope that Encore works on this problem and gets it right. It almost caused me to go back to drinking again! :) Hang In There!"
9359,open-ended,B00EVVO1DG,is this program compatible with clip art or is it like clip art?,,"Easiest is to use a preset template and use clipart that comes with program. I was able to make a blank card and import clipart of my own from another source. I didn't try different formats, so cannot yet give complete answer. Sizing import is not obvious like illustrator or even Word. PrintMaster is at it's best when used to make easy card, flyer, calendar or page with your own photos."
9360,yes/no,B00EVVO1DG,Does this Platinum V6 work for windows 8?,Y,It worked OK. But it's nothing close to the old Printmaster that I had. The clip art was a great disappointment. And it was harder to work with. Now I'm stuck with it. I took it off and bought a different program. JC

9362,yes/no,B00EVVO1DG,Can Printmaster Platinum V6 open .bro files? I created them in an old version of Printmaster that doesn't work in Windows 8.1.,?,"I was very disappointed in Platinum V6 and had to go back to my old PM 18.1 in order to open my old files. I was in a bind: Had a new 8.1 computer that wouldn't recognize or accept my years of designs from many programs and wouldn't let me install my older programs so actually bought a new Windows 7 pro and installed all my old programs. I think the ""cloud"" is the technology of the future but what about our files of the past and present? I now have two computers. Dumb, but no options. FYI, I am 84."
9363,yes/no,B00EVVO1DG,can i design stationary,?,"Yes, had not thought about stationary. I design my own Christmas cards and note cards/birthday cards. Using my own photos or drawings. Print them out for use. Scan a photo etc. and save to use on note cards etc. Fun to use your own imagination or photos instead of graphics in the program."
9364,yes/no,B00EVVO1DG,does printmaster platinum v6 compatible with windows 8.1,Y,"it should be, yes"
9365,yes/no,B00EVVO1DG,Has anyone had success installing Printmaster Platinum V6 in Windows 8.1?,?,"Forget it. Had my tech support do it and he complain about how long it took. First time I used it, I was pissed because it is time consuming to use and more importantly it has NOTHING that Print shop has. What a waste. Don't buy it. I had to locate one of our Dells that still had Printshop. I wish there was a graphics software that worked with the new Macs. Sorry to disappoint."

9368,yes/no,B00EXPSVJK,Is this compatible with Windows 8.1?,?,"I bought this program because I had contcted print shop and I was told it was so I bought it, this was a good program in the past but now it is one of the worse programs I have bought, so my advice is to not purchase this product, but if you still wantbto buy I have one for sale,,, my advise would be to purchase microsoft publisher, this does just about everything that I need, just have a small learning curve,,,"
9369,open-ended,B00EXPSVJK,I have bought 3.5 all I need is a manual or print one off the internet not much to ask after I have downloaded to product,,"Yeah, they don't do that, you have to go to this link http://www.printshop.com/user-guide/35.aspx and it must be said... they are STILL working out bugs on that piece of... software"
9370,yes/no,B00EXPSVJK,Is there a manual to show how to use printshop 3.5 with Windows 8?,?,"No, there isn't anything extra. There's just the regular User's guide which you will find hidden under the ""help"" button in the upper part of the screen (on the right side). This user's guide is separated for version 3.0 and 3.5, same appears to the video tutorials which you can find there, too. But the software seems to being directed to Win 8 users. For me, using still XP it's too complicated to use, so usually I prefer to work with my Print shop 21 instead. Best regards, Heinz"
9371,open-ended,B00EXPSVJK,I can't edit a photo because it's too large?,,"I have run into issues with large images with this program before, this version of printshop is the worst I have ever seen so I wouldnt be surprised."
9372,yes/no,B00EXPSVJK,Do I have to upgrade printshop to run saved files from Vista to my new windows 8?,N,"No I don't think so, the new Print Shop is not as good as the older version, but neither is Win 8 oe 8.1"
9373,open-ended,B00EXPSVJK,i was typing some material i do not what happen some of the content disappear how can i get it back,,"You may be able to get it back with the ""undo"" option under the ""edit"" tab. If that doesn't work it was probably lost to a glitch. 3.5 is the worst version of this program I have ever seen. Good luck I hope it works for you!"
9374,yes/no,B00EXPSVJK,will this work on windows 7?,?,"I am returning my copy. It works with Windows 7 but no single project can be more than 20mg. It has great features but crashes and you cannot retrieve what you have created. It is a known defect, they told me they are working on it! They told me to try Print Shop 23."
9375,open-ended,B00EXPSVJK,I would like to know where to find after you create a card where on the page you find outside or inside the card in print shop 23 Jessica,,Look at the bottom of your project page
9376,open-ended,B00EXPSVJK,Would anyone know if I can use this for the purpose of professionally selling greeting cards without copyright or royalty issues from the templates?,,"I don't know exactly, but I would suspect that if you used their cards or any of their photo's or illustrations, that you might be in trouble. If you are using your photos and illustrations you might be okay, but don't take my word for it."
9377,yes/no,B00EXPSVJK,will it work on windows 8.1?,Y,"Yes, it does. That is specifically why I purchased it...because PrintShop 23 did not work on a Win 8 or 8.1 system. However, if you read my review, you will see I am VERY disappointed in this new version."
9378,open-ended,B00EXPSW2Q,Is the Print Shop Deluxe 3.5 compatible with Windows 8.1? And does it allow me to use previous cards made with version 23?,,It is compatible and does work with previous versions of printshop. The problem I found with it so far is that it does not allow you to make tables and does not permit you to acquire scanned photos directly. Both were part of previous versions. I find transition from earlier Printshops is much more complicated. The format has changed and has more moving parts which is time consuming. I kept version 23 on my other computer which is much easier to use. I am trying to return 3.5 but have had no response after filling out return form. Bottom line I am not happy with 3.5.
9379,open-ended,B00EXPSW2Q,Does anyone know if there is a program out there that works as good as Printshop 22 that is compatible with windows 7?,,"If you find one, please let the rest of the world know. I miss PrintShop a lot, but the new 3.5 is worthless and I sent mine back. Hopefully they will come up with something."
9380,open-ended,B00EXPSW2Q,"The box says there are thousands of borders but there is NO ""borders"" button and we can't find borders anywhere. What's the deal?

9382,yes/no,B00EXPSW2Q,"I had an older version &amp; could create ""quick prints""; can't find that option in PS Deluxe 3.5. Anyone know how? What is available isn't what i want.",?,I couldn't find it either. Very disappointed in this version.

9384,yes/no,B00EXPSW2Q,Is the Print Shop Delux 3.5 compatible with windows 8.1 or not,?,"Yes, but I could not ever get it to print labels correctly."
9385,yes/no,B00EXPSW2Q,Can I install the software in more than one computer?,?,"Each copy of the program is licensed for one computer. So if you have more then one computer, you will need to purchase a copy of the program for the other computers as well."
9386,yes/no,B00EXPSW2Q,Can I program this Print Shop 3.5 Deluxe on both my desktop and my laptop computers.,Y,Yes you can as long as you have the activation code or product key that you will receive with your original download.
9387,yes/no,B00EXPSW2Q,does it work for windows 8.1,Y,"Every time windows did an update I had to reload 3.5 printshop in order to make it work properly. I got tired of doing that and took it back. I just used my printshop 21 and installed it on my windows 8 machine and it works. Altho when you run the printshop 21 installation it actually says it is not compatible and may not run. But I tried it anyway, and it worked. I have an HP laptop that is about 1.5 years old, running windows 8.1, with 16 gig of ram. So it is a fairly up to date machine."

It does not offer 10-key training; however, there are fee 10-key training tutorials on the Internet. As an experienced typist, one who previously typed 80+ WPM, and who is returning to the job market, the Mavis Beacon tutorial provided the structure and required discipline for me to achieve my goal of a minimum 60 WMP for prospective employer typing tests."

If your computer is not exposed to anything from the outside, you don't even need antivirus. As I understand Webroot AV, it acts as line of defense to prevent the pc from catching the virus from the internet or other sources (infected USB drives and hard drives). It found viruses on my laptop after I installed so it works in that way as well. So if you already got a virus, you will need to be connected to the internet. With your 15gb plan, you will be getting on the internet so it should protect you from catching any viruses and warn you of dangerous webpages that may be infected and identify any viruses you may already have."

With your 15gb plan, you will be getting on the internet so it should protect you from catching any viruses and warn you of dangerous webpages that may be infected and identify any viruses you may already have."

I have it on my Windows 8 computer myself and absolutely love it, but I don't use Apple products. I would double check with their customer service to see if this would be supported in Apple products, but it does work amazing for Android products (I currently have it on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and I was surprised by how easily it operates in the background and how fast it gets rid of threats)."

9531,open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,What is the difference between the Internet Security version and the 360 version?,,"It is very frustrating that Norton can't place a comparison column on their website. I found an article on techsoup.org, written by Debbie Landshoff, that is 2 years old but explained the difference between the two. It stated that they both have anti-virus, anti-spam and anti-spyware etc. but that 360 also adds these extras, which you may or may not need: 360 Adds Startup Management, Data Backup, and PC Maintenance 360 has the following capabilities in addition to those in NIS and NAV. Startup Management Norton Startup Manager displays a list of applications that are set to run at startup and allows the user to stop them from running at startup or to delay them until shortly after startup. This helps shorten the amount of time that you have to wait for your computer to be ready for use. Automatic Backup and Web-Based Backup Access Norton can back up all your files, except for system and program files. You can back up to local or network drives (including flash drives), and you can also use Norton's online backup to store your data in the cloud. You can set up one or several backup routines (called backup sets) that specify the files and folders that you want to back up, the backup location, and the backup schedule. The configurable items are: *What kinds of files to back up, for example pictures, music, email, contacts, and office documents. *The locations you are backing up, such as My Documents and specific drives. *The backup destination: Norton online backup in the cloud, internal or external hard drive, flash drive, or network drive. *Whether the backup runs automatically on a weekly or monthly basis, or manually. For weekly or monthly, you can specify the date and time. If you are on a computer that is not running 360, you can download any file backed up to the cloud by logging in to the Norton Online Backup site. Or, you can log in to that account and email a link to the file to someone else. PC Tuneup 360 cleanup tasks include removing outdated files left behind by Internet Explorer or Windows, optimizing the hard drive, and cleaning up the Windows registry."

9535,open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,what is the difference between PC or PC download,,"to the best of my knowledge , they will sell it to you on line direct and allow you a download into your PC . I highly suggest not doing so , buy the disc , it allows you 3 uses, also when its time to renew it is less expensive to just buy a new one each year , if you renew on line you pay more and its a one time shot. this way it allows you to install it on 3 computers or if you had to re-install yours for any kind of reason you have it in your hands . save the packaging it has the activation code you'll need for each install. it has been working well , also i suggest not to allow the Norton Tool Bar to be activated , it stops you from going to certain web sites , it didn't let me log into my bank or get my e-mail until i disabled the norton toolbar , then everything worked fine. Its a great deal especially if you own more than one computer."

9538,open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,if i have a virus on my pc will this removed it?,,I haven't had one on my computer in the 6 years that I've had it. I have always used 360 or some type of Norton Antivirus. But they say 24 tech support so I can only assume that they help remove any viruses you may encounter. I am not 100% sure so you may want to contact them directly before purchasing
9539,open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,Bitdefender or Norton?????????????,,"Al, It really depends on if you want to customize your settings (Bitdefender) or you just want to install and let it do it's thing (Norton). I have had Norton poducts for the past five years. In the old days they were a little heavy on being resource hogs, but now they are much better. I personally would go with Norton, but I have no complaints against Bitdefender, just depends on if you like customizable options or not."
9540,yes/no,B00EZPXYP4,does it work on Windows XP systems?,Y,"Yes, I used it with XP, but they pack so much OTHER Junque, in with the Norton Program, that you have to be careful when you download it and run the program, so you can eliminate all the periferal stuff that you don't want. wbr"
9541,open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,What is the difference between the Internet Security version and the 360 version?,,"It is very frustrating that Norton can't place a comparison column on their website. I found an article on techsoup.org, written by Debbie Landshoff, that is 2 years old but explained the difference between the two. It stated that they both have anti-virus, anti-spam and anti-spyware etc. but that 360 also adds these extras, which you may or may not need: 360 Adds Startup Management, Data Backup, and PC Maintenance 360 has the following capabilities in addition to those in NIS and NAV. Startup Management Norton Startup Manager displays a list of applications that are set to run at startup and allows the user to stop them from running at startup or to delay them until shortly after startup. This helps shorten the amount of time that you have to wait for your computer to be ready for use. Automatic Backup and Web-Based Backup Access Norton can back up all your files, except for system and program files. You can back up to local or network drives (including flash drives), and you can also use Norton's online backup to store your data in the cloud. You can set up one or several backup routines (called backup sets) that specify the files and folders that you want to back up, the backup location, and the backup schedule. The configurable items are: *What kinds of files to back up, for example pictures, music, email, contacts, and office documents. *The locations you are backing up, such as My Documents and specific drives. *The backup destination: Norton online backup in the cloud, internal or external hard drive, flash drive, or network drive. *Whether the backup runs automatically on a weekly or monthly basis, or manually. For weekly or monthly, you can specify the date and time. If you are on a computer that is not running 360, you can download any file backed up to the cloud by logging in to the Norton Online Backup site. Or, you can log in to that account and email a link to the file to someone else. PC Tuneup 360 cleanup tasks include removing outdated files left behind by Internet Explorer or Windows, optimizing the hard drive, and cleaning up the Windows registry."

9545,open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,what is the difference between PC or PC download,,"to the best of my knowledge , they will sell it to you on line direct and allow you a download into your PC . I highly suggest not doing so , buy the disc , it allows you 3 uses, also when its time to renew it is less expensive to just buy a new one each year , if you renew on line you pay more and its a one time shot. this way it allows you to install it on 3 computers or if you had to re-install yours for any kind of reason you have it in your hands . save the packaging it has the activation code you'll need for each install. it has been working well , also i suggest not to allow the Norton Tool Bar to be activated , it stops you from going to certain web sites , it didn't let me log into my bank or get my e-mail until i disabled the norton toolbar , then everything worked fine. Its a great deal especially if you own more than one computer."

9548,open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,if i have a virus on my pc will this removed it?,,I haven't had one on my computer in the 6 years that I've had it. I have always used 360 or some type of Norton Antivirus. But they say 24 tech support so I can only assume that they help remove any viruses you may encounter. I am not 100% sure so you may want to contact them directly before purchasing
9549,open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,Bitdefender or Norton?????????????,,"Al, It really depends on if you want to customize your settings (Bitdefender) or you just want to install and let it do it's thing (Norton).

One ordering package list just the OS's and the other list OS's CODE?,,"The regular package ships with an installation cd.

9569,open-ended,B00EZQYC8G,Is this actually a disc or a download? I prefer to have the disc,,"A disc is included in the box, but you have the option to do it either way. Also in the box is a card that has the activation code that you would type in to activate your account by using either disc or download method (your choice). I activated mine using the disc which was my preference."
9570,yes/no,B00EZQYC8G,"If I have malware security,can I use the Norton Security too?",Y,"Yes, most malware programs do not interfere with Norton. As long as you keep the monitoring part of the malware program off and run scans intermittently you should be alright."
9571,open-ended,B00EZQYC8G,The box in the photo says protection for 1 year yet someone said it is only a 15 day trial. I tend to believe it is 1 year but can someone confirm?,,It is protection for 1 year.

You have a year from this date, but Norton counts the days backwards for you. Norton reminds you to renew. You do not have to keep track. Amazon.com also reminds you of renewal just before your year is up."
9575,open-ended,B00EZQYC8G,What is the difference between Norton Internet Security and Norton 360?,,"Not 100% sure, but it is a more advanced version. I suggest going on Norton's website where they have a video of what the differences is between the two. I may have even seen the video on Amazon. Their video convinced me to go up from the regular anti-virus to the security for more protection with internet buying and banking. Hope this helps."
9576,yes/no,B00EZQYC8G,is this as good as the 360? I have had Norton 360 for year bought it here for $19.99. Don't really want to pay $39.94 if I don't need it.,?,The only difference is 360 backs up some files and has a cleaning program that removes junk files periodically. The internet security has all the important stuff to keep your computer healthy and without viruses etc. I wouldn't use the extra parts of 360 anyway and that is why I always get internet security. Only get 360 if you use the other parts.
9577,yes/no,B00EZQYC8G,Is this software compatible with Windows XP &amp; will it work in Iowa/compatible worldwide?

9579,open-ended,B00EZQYBZ0,I already have 2013 version and more that a year before expiration what happens if I buy 2014 version ? am I extended another year ?,,"A few years ago, I renewd a Norton subscription and it added one year from the date I renewed, not added to the end of the subscription. When I renewed with my 2014 subscription, it extended my subscription by a year, adding it to the end of my current subscription, which is as I would expect. So while I can't say which will occur, my most recent experience is that it added time at the end of my current subscription."
9580,open-ended,B00EZQYBZ0,"All these sounds great!!, but I'm new in this game and I want to know; how long can I keep using this unit before it becomes in effective and have to be replaced with a new version?",,We replace outs once a year. Our month is October. That way we are always up to date.
9581,open-ended,B00EZQYBZ0,Do you run norton on your computer or how,,"Yes, and including the kids, we run Norton on 5 computers. On my main 2 we also run a Malware (MalwareBytes) program for back-up security. Norton has always been reliable, but last year I tried the anti-virus instead of the 360 and my computer got real sick, so I went back to the Internet security after I got cleaned and haven't had any real problems since."

9588,open-ended,B00F2BDP9K,I use a JVC EVERIO HD Camcorder which saves files in the TOD Format does the program support this format? has anybody experienced any issues with it?,,The Cyberlink website claims that Power Director 12 can import TOD files and can capture from the JVC Everio camcorder. http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultimate/spec_en_US.html There is a free trial version so you can test your compatibilities.
9589,yes/no,B00F2BDP9K,Does this PD 12 have DV camcorder capture and output like Power Director 10?,Y,Yes it does.
9590,yes/no,B00F2BDP9K,"Is there any way to ""turn off"" the Power Director commercials that come in the guise of an upgrade? I find it pretty annoying.",?,I agree that it is terribly annoying. Adware should NOT be something you pay this much for... I haven't found any way to turn those stupid sales nags off...
9591,yes/no,B00F2BDP9K,Does this product have the capability of capturing still photos from video?,Y,"Yes. Once your video is on the track, you can pause it and click a small camera icon under the viewing frame to capture a still image. I'm using PD13, but prior versions have also had this capability."
9592,open-ended,B00F2BDP9K,"If you already have Power Director 10 in your computer, will Power Director 12 over write PD 10 or will they function as 2 separate programs?",,They will still be 2 separate programs. And when you render your videos they save them in the 10 or 12 version folders. I still have 10 on my computer and it runs just as it did before 12. Hope this helps!
9593,open-ended,B00F2BDP9K,"At what point do you stop at a powerful computer for video editing! I think I went way overboard,Intel Core I7-5960x cpu extreme,Geforce 980 4gb",,"There is no stopping... faster everything lets you get things done faster.... you'll be thanking yourself for getting a great computer, especially if you have to edit a lot of video. Time is valuable too and a 'slow' computer is just annoying especially rendering/compiling/outputting video. Buy the best you can afford. Plus, it sounds like a great gaming computer too if you are into that. I bought a $1500 system nearly 4 years ago... while not as powerful as yours obviously, it's still an i-7 with some upgraded geforce graphics card. A powerful computer will last a long time where a bargain computer likely will have to be upgraded regularly just to keep up with the software."
9594,open-ended,B00F2BDP9K,Does it have Video Stabilization and can you rotate video?,,"I don't know the answer to those questions, but, There is a free product that I understand will rotate video. I havent tried it but you might check it out: The package is called ""Free Studio"". You can find it at dvdvideosoft.com. In the Editors section there is a module that will flip and rotate video."
9595,yes/no,B00F2BDP9K,Will this program extra video clips from production...store bought...DVDs?,N,Good question. I've never tried that. Most disc are encoded with some security so your computer will not allow you to download or copy them. I'm sure there's some stuff to download to get around that but I have no idea. If you did get around the security I'm sure you can have the entire film on your computer then of course you can do what you want with it.
9596,yes/no,B00F2DC1D4,Is it compatible with Windows 8?,Y,"Yes, I've used it with Windows 8 and I'm now on 8.1 with no problems."
9597,open-ended,B00F2DC1D4,I am a total novice! How is this program usage for a novice? Will it edit AVCHD or MP4 video for YouTube uploads?,,"In general CyberLink is easier to use than the comparable Adobe Photoshop tools. It is harder to master than something really simple like Microsoft Moviemaker, but that's inevitable. CyberLink has a novice mode which I have never used. It seems to be something like Moviemaker. CyberLink like all the comparable products requires you to understand the non-linear editing paradigm. Then there are all the 'features'. Ignore the features. CyberLink is now like Microsoft Word two decades ago - filled with extra features that few people ever need or use. If you stick to the fundamentals it is easy enough to master and you are unlikely to run out of power. For example for simply editing a clip to send to YouTube - nothing could be easier. But if you want to you can do a lot of audio manipulation. The reason products like this are intimidating is because they offer so many choices. For example you can produce a final edited clip in a dozen different formats. You can also send your edited clip directly to YouTube or several other systems. But you dodn't have to wallow in all those choices. Just pick what you want and ignore the rest."
9598,yes/no,B00F2DC1D4,Does this include both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the software?,Y,Yes it does. You can choose while installing.
9599,open-ended,B00F2DC1D4,I am reading about the ones who have upgraded. is this a stand alone program or do I have to have a previous version? thank you.,,"Hello, This is a stand alone program. I had a trial version of the PD software on my computer when I bought it, and I decided I liked it so much I'd get the full version. It was money well spent. The Power Director software is not as complex as the competitors, yet for the money this is a REALLY complete package. I'm very happy with the purchase. Just be sure and go online and get the updates after you install the program out of the box. Happy movie making!"
9600,yes/no,B00F2DC1D4,Can you cut a section of your video without having to delete the rest of the clip from the section you started to clip?,?,"I'm not totally sure what you are asking here. If you are asking if you can edit out a portion of a clip without deleting the entire clip or the time after the portion you want to edit out then yes you can. Just use the ""split"" function on the top left of your timeline. Move the arrow over the start of what you wanted to edit and hit ""split"" then move it to the end of what you want removed and hit ""split"" again and it will create a moveable portion of your video. You can move it somewhere else in the movie or just delete it totally."
9601,yes/no,B00F2DC1D4,Does this work on Windows XP?,?,I believe it works better on XP than windows 7. I would contact cyber link tech support to make sure.

9605,yes/no,B00F2DC1D4,Can I burn my videos to a DVD to view the product on a DVD player?,?,Yes. DVD or Blue Ray. There are options for different video formats to burn in.
9606,open-ended,B00F3ZN0CC,I bought a barebones kit and want to install this new. Is this a CD or is the software something I have to download?,,It is a DVD and should work for your application. My own experience as well other reviews suggest clean installs work best.
9607,yes/no,B00F3ZN0CC,Is it legal to use this to install windows under Parallels on a Mac?,?,"If you plan on installing using bootcamp and parallel or vmware fusion, you need the system builder edition. Couple of weeks ago i purchased the Full V8 from Microsoft store (electronic download), and ended up having to refund because my full version was not supported for a clean install on a Mac. Microsoft support explained to me that i had to wait for the release of the full 8.1 system builder. Hope it helps...."
9608,open-ended,B00F3ZN0CC,How many machines can I install with Windows 8.1 system builder OEM version?,,One unless you purchase a multi license
9609,open-ended,B00F3ZN0CC,"What is the difference between the OEM version and the ""Full"" version? Do they leave off some capabilities and features?",,"The answers so far are interesting and slightly misleading. For Win8 Pro OEM, if you go to MS's website here: http://personaluselicense.windows.com/en-US/default.aspx You will read what MS says about its own software. To save you some time, I will post the question and response from this site: Can I transfer the software to another computer or user? You may transfer the software to another computer that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software (together with the license) to a computer owned by someone else if a) you are the first licensed user of the software and b) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. To make that transfer, you must transfer the original media, the certificate of authenticity, the product key and the proof of purchase directly to that other person, without retaining any copies of the software. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Anytime you transfer the software to a new computer, you must remove the software from the prior computer. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between computers. You may transfer Get Genuine Windows software, Pro Pack or Media Center Pack software only together with the licensed computer."
9610,yes/no,B00F3ZN0CC,"can I activate windows 8 pro oem system builder with this key, im not ready to upgrade to 8.1 yet",N,"I am not sure, to be safe I would suggest buying Win 8 Pro and updating to SP1 when your ready"
9611,yes/no,B00F3ZN0CC,"If purchased, is there an option to download the OS as my tower will not have an optical drive?",?,I believe you can. There are many articles online about installing Windows 8 or 8.1 from a USB drive. The Microsoft upgrade assistant can direct you to the correct ISO file and tell you how to format the USB.
9612,open-ended,B00F3ZN0CC,What should I buy if I am building a pc and want to install windows 8? 64bit ofcourse,,"If it's for your pc then get the OEM version. If you're at all interested in Windows Media Center, or just like the extra features Pro has, then go with Win 8.1 Pro as the WMC upgrade is only $10 for Pro. If you're not going to use any of the added features that Pro or WMC provides then find the Win 8.1 OEM version. Going with the OEM versions saves you the hassle of installing it twice from the Upgrade versions and saves you a small fortune compared to the full retail version."
9613,open-ended,B00F3ZN0CC,I am building my own system for my own use. Can I install this OEM version on it. Or is it restricted to just Original Equipment Manufacturers?,,"Yes, you can install to your built system. Software has no technical support from Microsoft. I installed it to my home built system."
9614,yes/no,B00F3ZN0CC,can I load 8.1 pro on to my Microsoft windows 7 home premium,N,"No, 8.1 is not an upgrade to windows 7. You must have windows 8 to upgrade to 8.1. However, there is a rumor that Microsoft is developing windows 8.2 that will be more like windows 7 (the designers have taken a ""what does the customer wants"" rather than their normal ""you will like what we give you or tough"" approach. So before you upgrade, I would wait to see how 8.2 looks and operates."
9615,yes/no,B00F3ZN0CC,Can this version be installed with bootCamp?,?,I believe you can .. Check this link and follow the instructions https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201457
9616,open-ended,B00F3ZNA7M,What is the difference between the program disc and the system builder?,,"system builder is designed to be put on a freshly assembled computer to be resold. this version is not designed to be installed on any other computer (cannot be re-licensed on another machine). the full retail version can be installed on a computer, then uninstalled and moved to another computer if you need to change computers. this one cannot."
9617,yes/no,B00F3ZNA7M,I have a HP laptop (Pavillon dv7-1135 / Entertainment Notebook)64bit and running a Window Vista sytem. Will they help work with my laptop? I need to put a HP jetpro laser printer into it and it needs a Window 7 or up program.,?,"I actually returned the system builder, and ordered the original version. The builder only works on the motherboard it is installed on. The original version, you can install on other computers. .......also, as for the printer, my newer one installed with no problems. And, one that is about 10 years old installed with no problems. ................I would recommend the original version for the same price."
9618,open-ended,B00F3ZNA7M,what is the different between 32 bit and 64 bit?,,I am pretty sure that if your computer is 32 bit the 64 won't work. I would research upgrading the software. I ended up just buying a new computer because I had problems upgrading my old PC.
9619,yes/no,B00F3ZNA7M,"After putting a new SSD in my Macbook Pro, can I use this to install Windows 8?",?,"Hi Matt I am no expert on Mac, but I think you can. I have researched it and all indicates your good to go. Good luck David"
9620,yes/no,B00F3ZNA7M,Will this fix my blue screen problem?,Y,"Yes, or use daily backup software and reinstall if you do get a blue screen."
9621,yes/no,B00F3ZNA7M,Could you explain what system builder is?,?,designed mostly for a reseller of computers. they provide the computer with Win8.1 pre-installed from the system builder version. this os stays with the hardware and is not transferrable to another computer like the comercial version is. this one costs less and if you do not plan to get rid of your computer for a while it is an excellent option.
9622,yes/no,B00F3ZNA7M,Can I upgrade to 8.1 from XP?,N,No upgrade from XP. This is a full replacement install requiring a re-formatted hard drive.
9623,yes/no,B00F3ZNA7M,Can this be used as an upgrade over Windows 7 starter,?,"This is designed to be installed on a clean hard drive (freshly formatted), to go from 7 to 8 you need an Upgrade version."
9624,open-ended,B00F3ZN2W0,"What does that mean, ""Software edition. Not DVD?"" Does it include the installation disk, or is this a download?",,"Just received mine, It is a DVD and a Case Sticker with the Key. Not much else. Wanted to answer for those who were curious."
9625,yes/no,B00F3ZN2W0,Is this a full version for a computer that has no operating system,?,"Yes, the install offers an upgrade or to do a full (clean) install which is what I did. If you're putting an SSD and hard drive in to your machine, don't connect the hard drive until after the install if you want the OS to be on the SSD. The installer can get confused if you have more than one drive available."
9626,open-ended,B00F3ZN2W0,"Is this the version to get to build a virtual machine on a mac, or do I need the ""full version""",,Yes this is the version you would buy to create a virtual machine on a Mac. I used this version to build a windows 8 machine on my iMac using Parallels. Works like a charm.
9627,yes/no,B00F3ZN2W0,"I have two computers, Can i install windows 8.1 on both the systems with the same product key?",N,No one key = one computer.
9628,open-ended,B00F3ZN2W0,What is the difference between OEM version and the original version? I purchased the OEM version to use with VMWare Fusion on a mac.,,"The difference is mostly licensing and support. The OEM version is intended for ""system builders"". You can't transfer it if your computer breaks, it can't be used to 'upgrade' an older version (so you can't keep your files and settings), you get less customer support from Microsoft, and technically you're not supposed to install it on your own computer (""Windows 8.1 system builder software does not permit personal use, and is intended only for preinstallation on customer systems that will be sold to end users."")."
9629,open-ended,B00F3ZN2W0,What if I install this on an older motherboard that crashes (dies/fails)? Do I loose out on my license or can I install on my replacement?,,"I have not had to do that yet. But my other fellow computer geeks assure me that if you go through the process with a Microsoft tech., you can. Be warned that it is a lengthy and tedious process."
9630,open-ended,B00F3ZN2W0,What do I buy to upgrade from my Windows XP?,,Best way to buy the new system is to start from scratch. Technology has changed substantially from the XP time. Buy a new system with Win 8.1.
9631,open-ended,B00F3ZN2W0,How to remove this pesky 8 and install regular 7? Purchased with Dell Inspiron 660s i660s-2002BK Desktop (Black) Mother is sick with it.,,"Have you tried ""classic shell"" yet. Makes it operate like win 7, but faster. Also boots into desktop vs metro crap. I have not seen thAt metro screen in the 5 months i've had classic shell. But if you still need to go to win 7 you will need a key ($100) and a install disk or usb."
9632,open-ended,B00F3ZN2W0,why my product key is not working?,,"Is this the first time that it has been used? And are you sure that it is not an upgrade? There is a way to get your key to work if you installed the upgrade as a full version. You can google it on the web, or do the following: Press the Windows key and type regedit(press enter)Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL-MACHINE/software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE(double chick on the)MediabootInstall(key in the right pane) Change the key's value from 1 to 0. Ext the registery, press the windows key again and type cmd. Right-click on the comand prompt icon and run it as an administrator. type: slmgr /rearm(press enter) reboot Windows. When you get back into Windows, you should be able to run the activation utility and activate Windows."
9633,open-ended,B00F3ZN2W0,I online game allot and wondering if this operating system would be worth buying? My current operating system is Windows 7.,,This OS can better take advantage of modern hardware than Windows 7. That is about the only advantage to using Win8 vs Win7.
9634,open-ended,B00F5OFPXS,how many computers can you put it on. I have a PC and mac and would want it on both,,"When you purchase Cook'n, you get a household license which means that you can install one copy on multiple computers as long as all of the computers are within the same household."
9635,yes/no,B00F5OFPXS,Can you use your printer/scanner to scan in already printed recipes into the Cook'n program?,Y,"Yes. Cook'n Version 11 has a feature called Scan-It that will automatically OCR your scanned recipes (that means, translate them to text) and display a Snip-It tool that makes it very easy for you to get your scanned recipes into Cook'n. If you don't have a scanner, you can take photos of your recipes with the Cook'n Mobile App on your smart phone and Cook'n will OCR and import those too!"
9636,yes/no,B00F5OFPXS,can you export to word?,?,"Absolutely! When you open Cookn', Click on FILE: EXPORT, WORD. Very easy!"
9637,open-ended,B00F5OFPXS,Anyone running into any bugs? nutritional calculator doesn't always allow changing the number of servings (so only displays whole-recipe values),,"The nutrition calculator always allows changing the number of servings. You should click the Settings button in the nutrition screen and make sure that the check-box ""Divide nutrient amounts by number of people served"" is checked. Also, you should know that, many times, the user gets confused when they use Cook'n to analyze nutritional values. For example, let's say you have a brownie recipe that serves 10 people and let's say that the number of calories per serving is 150. Sometimes people will change the serving size from 10 to 20 and Cook'n will say that the calories per serving is still 150. Then, people e-mail DVO complaining that the nutrition calculator is not working correctly. The fact is if you change the serving size from 10 to 20, the recipe quantities also increase. The recipe now calls for twice as much butter and twice as much sugar, etc. Since the recipe quantities increased at the same rate as the number of people served, the number of calories per serving actually stays the same!"
9638,open-ended,B00F5OFPXS,"Can you personalize the weekly meal planner calendar? For example, can it say Breakfast, Snack, Lunch, Snack, Dinner and Dessert?",,"Yes. You have total control. You can choose labels such as Breakfast, Snack, Lunch, etc. as you suggested. And, you can create your own labels. You can also embed menus inside other menus. For example, you may create a Spaghetti Meal which consists of the spaghetti sauce, garlic bread, salad, and dessert (i.e. Main Dish, Side Dish, Salad, Dessert, etc) and then add that meal to ""Dinner"" on ""Monday"" of your Week Menu #1. Then, later, you may combine Week Menu #1 with Week Menu #2, #3, and #4. As you can see, it is completely customizable. You have total control of your menu."
9639,yes/no,B00F5OFPXS,I am having trouble importing recipes from the internet. The internet doesn't seem to be accessible from Cook'n Recipes. Is anyone else having problem,?,"I have transferred Internet recipes within the past week. Each time, there is a little hunt and peck on my part. If I would refer to the demonstration video again, I don't think I would waste so much time. Not all recipes have the correct format for easy transfer, but can be done. The site I used was King Arthur Flour and those recipes transferred well. Did you get the demonstration video? I was having trouble at first until I studied the video. I hope this helps."
9640,yes/no,B00F5OFPXS,"I'm always tweeking my recipes. Once my recipes are saved in Cook'n, can I open the recipe and make changes to it?

9642,yes/no,B00F5OFPXS,"Are there problems with Macs importing scanned documents? In spite of having a clear scan, I keep getting gibberish when I import.",Y,"I don't have a Mac, but I had the same problem with my PC (Even with completely plain recipes printed out of MS word in Times New Roman font and absolutely no images, graphics, or fluff of any sort). DVO told me that if the background is grey it has more trouble, you might try boosting the contrast and see if that helps clear it up at all. Personally, I just gave up on that feature as trying to get it to work was taking longer than just inputting them myself."
9643,open-ended,B00F5OFPXS,Does anyone know what the difference is between this product on Amazon and the sold from the DVO website. The price on DVO is $79.95?,,"They are theoretically the same. However, I bought it and returned it because it wasn't worth it at any price. I subsequently purchased MasterCook and it's a vastly superior program with all the bugs and kinks worked out -- which can't be said for Cook'n."
9644,open-ended,B00F8K9L66,"My husband has an LLC, and I have income from stocks, which program would best serve our purposes?",,My wife has a small business and we have a portfolio of stocks and mutual funds. I have used the Home and Business version for years and it has worked great. I'm not sure about the LLC but I think that would be covered as well. All you have to do is answer questions.
9645,open-ended,B00F8K9L66,Is the use of the bonus offer an option or are you required to use a portion of your return to purchase a gift card?,,"The Amazon gift card bonus offer is optional. You can direct any part, all or none of your refund to the gift card. It's entirely up to you."

9650,open-ended,B00F8K9L66,Am I better to get disc or download turbo tax business &amp; home?,,It depends on how quickly you would like to get started. I downloaded TurboTax and able to recover it if needed.
9651,yes/no,B00F8K9L66,Can I do multiple returns on this edition?,?,"Yes, I do several.."

You can e-file up to 3 state returns per federal return. The state e-file is not free. You can print and mail your state return for free, or you can pay for the e-file ($19.99 per e-file). You can print and mail as many federal or state returns as you want for free, there is no limit. Only one free state-package is included, though, which you select to download when you install/get to the state part. If you are in the situation you need to file a return in more than one state, it will cost $39.99 per extra state (in addition to the optional e-file cost)."

9658,yes/no,B00F8K9MZQ,will it work with windows XP ?,N,"Phil: Probably - check TurboTax website for system requirements. (I use Win7 & Win8). BTW in case you don't already know, Microsoft will end ALL support for Win XP mid-April 2014 - no more Windows XP Security updates, etc. thereafter. It's easy to upgrade XP to Win7 or Win8 (buy the Upgrade DVD package), so long as you've got some spare hard disk space for the install. Microsoft website provides free W7 & W8 Upgrade Assistant downloadable tools you can run to find out if your XP box's hardware is good enough and to tell you which current apps will & will not run on them. If your PC has a relatively new CPU (ore2 Duo or later), I recommend you upgrade XP to 64-bit architecture Win 7 or Win 8 (instead of 32-bit). Cheers."
9659,yes/no,B00F8K9MZQ,Will the Deluxe enable me to enter the sale of my home?,?,just the capital gains or loss. That amount over the cost of the home and improvements or net gain/loss.

9665,open-ended,B00F8K9KZS,"Can this software be used to fill out multiple returns? if so, is there a limit?",,"I believe it is for individual returns, not multiple. LOL defeats purpose of their sales with folks using multiple returns."
9666,open-ended,B00F8K9KZS,elderly dependents deductions?,,"yes,if they have been living with you for at least 6 months of 2013. Turbotax Premier answers this question very thoroughly under deductions."

9668,yes/no,B00F8K9KZS,Can I use a prior year Turbo tax to file 2013 taxes...,?,"I don't believe you can. Even if it were possible, I wouldn't advise it. To get around the MAC OSX problem, I used the TurboTax online version. I also understand that you can use the H&R Block software and it will allow you to transfer in your prior year information. Good luck!"
9669,yes/no,B00F8K9KZS,is this a cd?,?,Choose PC/Mac option before adding to your cart if you don't want a download version.
9670,open-ended,B00F8K9KZS,"If I buy this for filing 2013 tax, can I use the tool to file 2014 as well? My second question is, can I take print out of tax prep?",,"I use the 2013 Turbo Tax as a help for me to work up my tax estimates for the year 2014, as I file and pay quarterly taxes. Turbo Tax is helpful in working up the 2014 estimates. You must however buy a new 2014 Turbo Tax to complete your 2014 taxes, as tax rates change and laws change.

9679,yes/no,B00F8K9N1E,CAN THIS BE USED 2X FOR 2 PEOPLE?,?,"Yes, as long as the software is not illegally shared. The license agreement allows you to use the TurboTax software to prepare as many returns as you like. However, the software can be installed only to computers belonging to you."

9683,yes/no,B00F8K9N1E,Is this version eligible for the TurboTax/Quicken combo rebate?,?,I am sorry but I don't use quicken. I'd say if the same one in the stores qualifies then this would too.

9697,open-ended,B00F8K9N32,Does this Turbo tax Business Fed also have everything that Turbo tax Home and Business have?,,"They are different tools. The business package is for corporate, partnership and things like LLC's. You most likely would still need Turbotax for your personal taxes."

That being said, I can tell you it works very well on my system (Windows 7 PC). If you get the student version, you will be required to submit proof of student status in order to activate the product. Having worked with full versions of Photoshop for years, this is not bad for being a scaled down version of the professional software. I would definitely contact the manufacturer (Adobe) to verify. http://www.adobe.com/company/contact.html is their ""contact us"" page. Good luck."

After installing PhotoshopElements 12, the program didn't work the way my old version of Photoshop Elements 9 did. It's supposed to work with layers, but it doesn't. And the navigation is imprecise. I uninstalled it after testing it out, and Amazon was gracious enough to provide a refund on the downloaded software."

Can I correct these blemishes with PE 12,?,"It depends on the severity of the blemishes and your skill with Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.

9753,yes/no,B00F8LJ5DY,How many audio tracks are avail..can you independantly fade the individual audio tracks selected ? i,Y,"Yes you can. There's a few setting for what you're wanting. You select the track and right click and select fade in or out. Or costume fade points. I haven't done those yet because I haven't had the need to, but yes you can. Go on YouTube to lean more before you get disappointed on spending your money and didn't get what you thought it was. Note this program take a high in computer, please have a I7 for the best result. Also once you buy the download you CAN'T GET YOUR MONEY BACK. It's a Amazon thing. Well I hope this helps and thank you for reading."
9754,yes/no,B00F8LJ5DY,Is this a good program to creat top quality music video.,?,"You can do a good music video, but your video camera quality and computer processing is the key in producing a good video. Good luck"
9755,yes/no,B00F8LJ5DY,Is this program good for making promo flyers?,?,"Yeah,it's really easy to use. Before buying it, look at YouTube video for a 2nd opinion. I've been using photoshop for the last two and half years, so yes you can, but there is not a layout for a flyer. You have to do it form scrap and do it by layers. Over all it's easier to use then photoshop CS5. The video editor is easy to use but recommend watching YouTube videos before hand. It will help I recommend having a I7(2.4ghz), and 8gb of ram for the best performance. This program will use a lot of the CPU. So if your rendering don't anything else or the program will crash."
9756,yes/no,B00F8LJ5DY,can i insert text in a photo,?,"Yes, but not a simple answer at this level"
9757,open-ended,B00F8LJ5DY,"If I purchase the CD version, do I need to worry about how many times I install it? Or can I re-use it over the years with each new computer I buy?",,I purchased the PC download. You can reuse it on new computers as long as you like the software. I don't think the key will support multiple computers active at the same time unless you buy addditional seats. But it will be limited to PC or Mac version which ever you purchase. And there will come a day when Adobe won't support updates for operating systems developed in the future.
9758,yes/no,B00F8LJ5DY,can you split these and use one each on two PCs at the same time ? I posted this on the Adobe Community and they don't know,?,"Yes you can. The license allows you to install on two computers - say a desktop and your laptop. You're only allowed to use one compuiter at a time, however."
9759,open-ended,B00F8LJ5DY,My computer is not in the best condition and may need to be replaced in the next year. If my current computer dies will I be able to re-install it?,,"I believe that you are entitle to two installations. You are not supposed to be running both installs at the same time, as you still only have one license. If you have a problem, you can always call Adobe, and they will usually set you up for an additional install. I have had to do that with other Adobe products when a hard drive failed, and they have always been cooperative."
9760,yes/no,B00F8LJ5DY,Does Element 12 allow you to make a screen saver that comes on when the computer is idle?,Y,I wish I could answer but my Element 12 has never worked in spite of spending hours on the phone with Adobe
9761,yes/no,B00F8LJ5DY,Can I download the software if I am a customer from India as the product details specifies that there needs to be US Billing Address?,?,"I cannot talk for Amazon, but if you purchase it direct from Adobe then you can download it."
9762,open-ended,B00F9ZQQ8Q,"If I have VHS tapes how do you put on disk , and will it hold the complete movie",,Creator NXT will make a movie of the VHS but you need a video capture card or some way to get the video/audio into your computer. Google or search on Ebay. The easiest way is to buy a DVD recorder. Some come with a VHS player built-in.
9763,yes/no,B00F9ZQQ8Q,Can this program shrink a video file to fit on a disc?,Y,"Yes, but I don't recommend it. The video will look considerably worse and it strips out the 5.1 track for two channel stereo. I've done it once (sending video to the grandparents who won't notice the degradation), but I won't do it again."
9764,yes/no,B00F9ZQQ8Q,Will Roxio Creator NXT 2 convert and burn MTS (ACHD) file to a blu-ray disk?,?,Yes Roxio does recognize ACHD format and burns to blue-Ray.
9765,open-ended,B00F9ZQQ8Q,Does this product have a sound editor function that allows you to record from other sources like a microphone or record player using a sound card as provided in earlier versions?,,Yes
9766,yes/no,B00F9ZQQ8Q,is this product in the original packaging? Thank you,?,"Everything that I got was in the original packaging, yes. It's the retail version, not an OEM copy or used."

9769,yes/no,B00F9ZQQ8Q,Does Roxio NXT2 include the usual label producing software?,Y,Yes it does
9770,yes/no,B00F9ZQQ8Q,Does this work both on Window 8.1 and Window 7? Thanks.,Y,"Yes, I was running windows 7 then upgraded to windows 8.1"
9771,open-ended,B00F9ZQQ8Q,what happens with my creator 2010 slide shows when I uninstall this version?,,"I've never used that function but if the files appear to be unique/proprietary, my best guess is that they'd be compatible with another version. Depending on your ultimate goal (stick with Roxio or not) it might be best to save the files, back-up the files, possibly explore conversion software options."
9772,yes/no,B00FB5R6L0,"Can this program burn audio cd's that will play in the car? I upgraded to windows 7 and lost my old roxio, which handled that function perfectly.",Y,"Yes Sir, It Will Work Great !!"
9773,yes/no,B00FB5R6L0,can the nero software update my hard drive?,?,I wouldn't think so.
9774,yes/no,B00FB5R6L0,Is it 64 bit compatible?,Y,"Not sure they say it is,I could not get it to work.The installation showed successful,but would not let me copy a CD that I burned,wanted me to upgrade at a additional cost.Called in for tech support and they wanted $1.29 a minute to talk to them. I have Windows 7 and they showed that version was supported.I tried numerous times and still would not work,and I was not going to pay the $1.29 a minute to talk with tech support. I returned to Amazon and am looking for another product. I,am thankful Amazon has a great return policy on goods they sell."
9775,yes/no,B00FB5R6L0,will nero express 3 copy movie dvd,?,I'm pretty sure it does it says that in the description. I purchased this to make dvds from videos that I put on my computer from my video Camera but it wouldn't allow me to do that. I returned it.
9776,yes/no,B00FB5R6L0,Will this software duplicate encoded discs,N,"No, but try slysoft.com"
9777,yes/no,B00FB5R6L0,does it burn mp4 video files,Y,yes
9778,open-ended,B00FB5R6L0,Does it simply burn a CD and/or DVD from jpegs?,,"A jpeg or jpg file is a data file. It contains data for a picture. If you have a picture on your computer, it can be written to the CD or DVD. You would choose the data file option for CD or DVD then drag the photos into the Disc Content box. Watch the green bar at the bottom to see how much you can fill the CD. A DVD has more room. I have family photos on my computer that I have scanned and put them on a disc and sent them to other family members. I also have photos downloaded from the internet that I use for desktop backgrounds. I can put them on a disc also. BTW. Put your music files on as a data disc and you can fit hundreds of songs on one disc and listen for hours. So, use up a few discs to see what works for you. You can also reuse a disc for your experiments."
9779,yes/no,B00FB5R6L0,does it work with windows 8.1,Y,Yes
9780,yes/no,B00FB5R6L0,"Does this software let you have a ""play all"" selection on the main menu?",N,I don't see that anywhere on the main menu. It's not something I use.

If they are copy protected. Nero will prevent you from copying them. If they are not (and you have permission) you will be able to copy them.

9790,yes/no,B00FB5R4SA,does nero 2014 rip audio discs to mp3 format?,?,"Yes so does windows media centre and iTunes which is a free download. I have used Nero for years and am disappointed in ver 14, ver 10 was better. Recode has less useful functionality and Video is less flexible than before and actually more buggy. I'm not buying again."
9791,yes/no,B00FB5R4SA,"Does this play Bluray movie Disks as is on does it need a ""player"" software. I am looking for a cheap player of BD's",?,"Hello! I bought this Nero2014 for the very same reason. Out of the box, I was able to play Blu-Ray movies, however, after a software update, this ability was stripped away! I contacted Nero, and after much delayed email support, they emailed me diagnostics software to run. The diagnostic software created a file to email back to them for troubleshooting. They responded back to me that my graphics card is no longer supported. I have an HP Envy 27"" that I bought in April 2014, with both an integrated Intel graphics card and NVIDIA graphics card. The system automatically switches based on graphics need. Externally, I have an Optiarc (Sony, the inventor of Blu-Ray) BD-RW drive connected via USB."

Good news: Nero 2014 Platinum is exactly the product you need for converting your movies from avi, mkv, or other formats and burning them onto a DVD that can be played back in any DVD player. Simply start the application Nero Video, select ""DVD"" -&gt; ""DVD-Video"", then add your avi or mkv files to the compilation, enter an empty DVD media to your recorder drive, start the burning process, that's it. Thanks and best regards, Eduardo Vento"
9794,open-ended,B00FB5R4L2,why does nero 2014 platnium only find one of my two blu ray recorders? both drives are shown in the file mgr. &amp; in device mgr both working properly,,"It does not matter if both devices show up. Nero only recognizes one of the devices. The primary one. IF you try to contact Nero they will charge you tech support, and it is not cheap."
9795,yes/no,B00FB5R4L2,I am concerned about the AVG Toolbar problem some have reported. Is that a simple matter of un-checking the AVG box at installation? Thanks.,?,I installed off the disc that came in the box and it didn't install AVG and I didn't see any option to select or deselect it during install so maybe it's just a problem if you don't use the disc and download the installer from the Nero website?
9796,open-ended,B00FB5R4L2,Can anyone tell me if they enjoyed using the software to watch movies or if they found this software to only be enjoyable for burning.,,Hi Terry&gt; Yes Nero Blue-ray Player which is included w/ Nero 2014 Platinum works perfectly well for viewing both regular DVD's & commercial Blue-ray movies viewing! If you don't like the Nero Blue-ray Player you could also use either ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 6 or PowerDVD 13 Ultra et cetera as all these do work well on both Windows 7 as well as on Windows 8.1 (x64). As for Windows Server 2012 R2 do rather use PowerDVD 13 Ultra as the others are not compatible w/ it!
9797,open-ended,B00FB5R4L2,How is this for burning Blu-Rays to back up your computer on Windows 7? I have a 12x NEC UBS-3.0 blu-ray burner and want to burn non-coasters.Thanks.,,"Hello John Barry, I work for Nero and saw your question about burning Blu-ray discs with your NEC recorder drive.

9798,yes/no,B00FB5R4L2,Can this software use country's language more?,?,"I'm not sure exactly what you are asking but you can go into the Nero ControlCenter, then under ""Language"" you can uncheck ""use system language for determining language"" and then below that select the language you desire in the drop down menu."
9799,yes/no,B00FB5R4L2,Does this software support Desktop Blu-Ray Players,?,I returned by software due to its inability to run on Windows 7 OS with all the features advertised.
9800,open-ended,B00FB5R4L2,Does it work to rip and convert regular dvds that you bought from a store or just dics that you made yourself?,,It will only work on non-copyrighted movies. Store DVDs/BDs typically have copyrights and/or DRM that will block you from copying. You would need additional software to remove the copyright/DRM from the DVD to be able to copy it (something like AnyDVD). The legality of it is questionable. I hope this helps :-)
9801,yes/no,B00FB5R4L2,Will this thing capture You Tube videos?,?,"I have not been able to do it with Nero 2014. ,but you can download Youtube Videos and a lot of other sites with a Free program called Freemake Video Downloader here: http://www.freemake.com/free_video_downloader/"
9802,open-ended,B00FEO2HUI,How much different is this than the Sage product? I used to be an Act! user from the first issues to 2005. 2005 was a disaster and Amazon reviews have been mostly negative since that time. I use Maximizer Entrepreneur now but they are moving everything...,,"Hello, each year they have added new features with new releases. As an ACT! Consultant I believe Act! is in better hands with Swiftpage than Sage with future development of the product. We do Act! Demos and can give you a 30 Day Trial of the software. If you would like to Contact Best Business Strategies we can provide these for you. Email Solutions@BestBusinessStrategies.net for more information."
9803,open-ended,B00FEO2HUI,I am going from Windows 7 to 8,,"I am using ACT! at my office one of the computers has windows 7 and one has Windows 8.1. It works on both systems and they are able to synchronize with each other. So yes, it does work on Windows 8."
9804,yes/no,B00FEO2HUI,I used Act on my old computer. Now I have a new one (laptop) Is this ACT compatible with any computer?,Y,I used it on my laptop and it's fine.
9805,yes/no,B00FEO2HUI,will this product work with skype?,?,"After using Act! for a few months now, I have grown to hate it. It's slow, cumbersome and it no longer syncs with MS Outlook (it did when I first got it). I recommend you try something else. I think Act! is a dinosaur about ready to go extinct! Online support is very poor."
9806,yes/no,B00FEO2HUI,"Do you need a prior installation of ACT for this? I dont have it installed, first time for me",N,"No you do not. It should run right out of the package. However, you will need to download several updates which are a bit time consuming."
9807,yes/no,B00FEO2HUI,Do multiple computers with this software loaded run off of the same database? Looking into this product for a small office with 3 workstations.,?,"I just bought this new version and have not installed it yet. But with all of the previous versions I have used, one computer operates as the server (unless you have an actual server, in which case of course, it opeates as the server). The other computers on the network access the database of the server/server equivalent. That way, the database and all relevant files appear the same on all computers. I believe the current version will allow you to operate three computers from the one purchase."
9808,yes/no,B00FEO2HUI,Is this a program that has to be renewed each year? I am just a single business person. Thanks.,?,This is a single user license with no expiration
9809,open-ended,B00FEO2HUI,how may licenses in this one package?,,Just one license per box.
9810,open-ended,B00FEO2HUI,"Since the first version, ACT! gets brought out and gets progressively worse! 2012 was my last upgrade! Anyone know how Swiftpage is handling ACT!?",,I have the same problem
9811,open-ended,B00FEO2HUI,"when you purchase the item, how many licenses do you get...I read 3 but is that correct? Also, is this version compatible with Mac and remote?",,"The purchase does give you 3 licenses so you can put it on your desktop, laptop and one other computer. They do NOT synchronize (you need a network version for that which is much more expensive), but at least you can move your work back and forth when you travel or are out of the office which is what I do. I don't know about Mac compatability, but I don't think this version works thru the cloud, at least not without some additional expensive software that may be from a 3rd party vendor. I looked into it at one point and decided against it (don't remember the details). Hope that helps!"
9812,yes/no,B00FFINOWS,Is form 1040 schedule c (profit or loss from small business) included in the deluxe turbo tax?,?,"Yes it is, but no 1099's which my wife buys separately. The Schedule C we use allows you to put in separate entries. We do not use the Q & A system."
9813,yes/no,B00FFINOWS,Is state filing included without extra charge?,?,"One state return is included, but California will charge $20 to file digitally. I don't know if other states have similar charges."
9814,open-ended,B00FFINOWS,"Can I download the 2013 version again after I've deleted it from my PC? In other words, if I'm audited, do I have to buy a second 2013 version?",,"Amazon allows you to re-download the software in the future. By the way, TurboTax also allows you to print your return as a PDF so you won't have to re-print your return in the future."
9815,open-ended,B00FFINOWS,What is the quantity of downloads for this software?,,"Amazon allows you to download the software as often as necessary. However, you must still abide by the license agreement. Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax"
9816,yes/no,B00FFINOWS,is this suitable for windows 8.1?,Y,Yes. I ran it on 8.1
9817,open-ended,B00FFINOWS,"Can I complete a Schedule C on this version? Just income, expenses and section 179 depreciation?",,"Yes, it has schedule C - it has everything you need and guides you every step of the way"
9818,open-ended,B00FFINOWS,"After purchasing the cd, I realized that my new laptop has no cd drive. Can I copy the cd onto a thumb drive or any suggestions so I don't pay twice?",,"Sure can and that is one of the easies ways to install where you don't have a CD drive. Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax"
9819,yes/no,B00FFINOWS,"I have a laptop windows 8, is there a problem with downloading?",Y,TuboTax works fine with Windows 7 home version. I've never had any compatibility problems for eight years. Here's a link that may be of help: https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899861-turbotax-online-system-requirements-for-tax-year-2013

9822,open-ended,B00FFINUJK,how many federal income tax returns can be e-filed with this product?,,The IRS imposes a limit of 5 federal efiled returns with any consumer software tax prep software.
9823,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,I need to file my 2013 taxes. Is this the correct version for 2013?,Y,"Yes, if you have a home based business and you might work elsewhere also. If your just now filing your 2013 taxes you are past the extension deadline. Expect some fees, fines, interest from the IRS if you owe money. Good luck with your taxes, remember to file by April 15th, 2015 or file for an extension for your 2014 taxes."
9824,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,is this the right one for llc and multi partners?,N,No it is not. It's the next one for partnerships
9825,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,Is the mac/pc download any different than the pc version?,?,Since I do not have a MAC I cannot honestly answer this question. I have used Turbo Tax for many years and have not had any problems. I am a retired Tax Accountant and please understand it does help knowing or having knowledge as to many of the questions that some people cannot answer. It does not take long to figure the program out. Hope this helps. Shelley S
9826,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,Can I use this for my 2014 taxes?,?,I had a problem with my return last year and there is no way you can get help from Turbo Tax. You have to go on line and ask people who are using it and they don't know the answer 90% of the time. It sucks!
9827,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,can I import quicken data to this?,Y,Yes.
9828,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,will this work with QuickBooks 2011,Y,Yes. They are both created by Intuit.
9829,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,"CPA did 2013 taxes, can I buy this to amend it?",Y,Yes. All you have to do is get your tax info and enter into the appropriate places. It will ask if this is for amending or regular filing and yes click on amend. I reccomend this to everyone. The only time I ever had a problem with my taxes is when I hired a CPA. Its easy to use.
9830,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,is this the right one for S Corporation with one officer?,?,"I cannot say for sure. I am a sole proprietor in my consulting business. It worked very well for me and there are features for inventory and business expenses that are not common in my case. I think an S corp is still taxed at an individual rate, so it should work."
9831,yes/no,B00FFINUJK,does this include free federal efile?,Y,Yes... You pay for the state efile though...
9832,yes/no,B00FFIO0NA,Does this version handle rental property depreciation?,Y,Yes it does. We always use it for that reason.
9833,open-ended,B00FFIO0NA,What happens if download gets interrupted or is corrupted? Can I download again?,,"You need to ask Intuit (Turbo Tax) people about that. I have downloaded via internet the last several years and never had such a problem, so do not know the answer."
9834,yes/no,B00FFIO0NA,Is this software compatible with windows 8.1?,Y,"Yes. I installed the product in Windows 7, then upgraded to win 8.1. The TurboTax continued to function exactly the same after the operating system update."
9835,yes/no,B00FFIO0NA,Will the download work on a HP Split with windows 8.1?,?,"I'm not sure what ""split"" means but I downloaded TTPremier onto my HP laptop with Windows 8 operating system. Last week I updated to Windows 8.1 The meat of my program works fine, but the ""Questions"" on the right side does not work...I have been unable to get an answer to this anomaly."
9836,open-ended,B00FFIO0NA,system requirements?,,https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/cd-download/system-requirements_thickbox.jsp?TB_iframe=true Pretty much any 21st century computer with a little but of HD space
9837,yes/no,B00FFIO0NA,Does the download install with Windows 8?,Y,Yes
9838,open-ended,B00FFIO0NA,Premier PC download version can still download Fed's to 5 PC and free Fed efile and state's to one PC? Why don't just indicate these clearly?,,"While that is true, with the investments and other issues I have, to me it was not important. I use only 1 pc and do my personal tax submittal as an individual. I have a;so found TTax a better qualified with their questions than CPAs at less cost. By just answering the questions that arise during preparation, my results are good and have veen for many years."
9839,yes/no,B00FFIO0NA,The purchased CD allows you to do up to 5 tax returns. Does the download also allow multiple tax returns?,Y,Yes it does. I did four separate returns this year and I did five last year.
9840,yes/no,B00FFIO0NA,Does it handle the sale of a home that I lived in?,?,I did not use this years version for the sale of a home but I had used in in 2009 for the sale and purchase of a home in two different states with no problem.
9841,yes/no,B00FFIO0NA,"Will the ""Premier"" version extract previous data from last year's ""Home &amp; Business"" version? (retired this year)",?,"I'm sure it will. I think I did the same thing when I retired, and it didn't even blink. It looks for the *.tax2013 file on your hard drive, and works from that. By the way, I also use Quicken for all my record keeping and that imports into TT as well. That and being able to download all of my investment data from the financial institution makes the amount of typing I have to do pretty minimal. But I'm sure you've found that out, as well as that you have to go back and double check everything line by line."
9842,yes/no,B00FFINXBU,Will this work with MAC's new Maverick iOS?,?,Works without problems for me also.
9843,open-ended,B00FFINXBU,how does it work for mac users? can you do forms 1065s (K-1s)?,,"I'm a Mac user and I am very satisfied. I've been using the Mac version of TurboTax for years and never had a problem. I have never had to use the form you reference, but I believe TurboTax gives you access to ALL tax forms."
9844,yes/no,B00FFINXBU,Can it do a 1041 form?,?,"I think so, when I clicked on 1041, it says I need schedules K-1 from your partnership, S corporation, or estate/trust and your Q form from your REMIC? They have great customer assistance so if this doesn't answer your question maybe call them."
9845,yes/no,B00FFINXBU,Will this work on a MAC operating system 10.6.8 ? Thanks,Y,"Presuming you're asking about the 2014 edition - if you scroll down on the product page, you will see a grey box with System Requirements - Mac OS 10.7.5 or later."
9846,yes/no,B00FFINXBU,Will the download work on Mac 10.6.8 operating system?,Y,Yes. I have a that macbook too. I have purchases turbo tax twice. It keeps a file on the computer for the next years taxes making updating previous years tax information unnecessary.
9847,yes/no,B00FFINXBU,can I download it for my iPad?,N,No. But you can download it for iPad from the Apple App Store. Or you can do it online via the web. Copy this link into address bar: https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/ipad.jsp Better hurry. : )
9848,open-ended,B00FFINXBU,"I can see that this is TurboTax 2013 but does that mean that it was published in 2013, or that it is for Tax Year 2013? In other words, is this old?",,It's for 2013 and contains the most recent updates. I don't know how old it is but I have used this for years.

9852,yes/no,B00FFIO4AO,can I do 2 state returns ?,?,"you can, but you have to pay for the second state. That's from personal experience this year."
9853,open-ended,B00FFIO4AO,Is there a maximum refund amount for the 10% Amazon bonus offer? and is there an expiration date for the gift card?,,"There is no expiration on the gift card. The maximum amount is $2000 per card and $10,000 per customer."

9855,yes/no,B00FFIO4AO,Can you download previous year info from h &amp; r block.,Y,"Yes, but it will transfer only your basic information."
9856,yes/no,B00FFINICE,Do you have to pay additional to file state taxes?,?,"Yes, this version does NOT include a state. See the other version that includes state."
9857,yes/no,B00FFINICE,Does this comment mean that the state tax filing is not included?,Y,"Correct. State is another $39, purchased with in the software."
9858,open-ended,B00FFINICE,for small business?,,"We have a small business and it has the forms and capability needed to file for partnerships and sole proprietor, etc, it just doesnt have all the canned questions you may need asked. What we did it use a tax accountant the first year to have them identify and be sure all the forms we needed were completed, then from that point on you can use this version as its simple to transfer year to year the needed forms and fill them out properly."
9859,open-ended,B00FFINICE,if i have a t1 which quicken do i need?,,I gave up on Quicken long ago.
9860,yes/no,B00FFINICE,Does this version import personal info from a prior year's TAX20xx file? Some reviewers' comments report trouble doing that.,?,Mine imported information process was flawless.
9861,yes/no,B00FFINICE,Does Deluxe version auto-fill all forms required to support K-1 partnership forms? H&amp;R Block requires manual manipulation and override,?,I'm not sure about that specific form but it auto fills the common ones
9862,yes/no,B00FFINICE,Does this handle schedule c ez?,Y,"Yes, it does."
9863,yes/no,B00FFINICE,can this version process a return filing 1098-T?,Y,Yes it can!
9864,yes/no,B00FFINICE,The online version for Deluxe does not include form 1040 Schedule D (Stock/Bond sales) this year! Does the desktop version still have it?,?,I downloaded it online. I do not know.

9866,open-ended,B00FFINRG6,PC/MAC download - do I have to buy two downloads? Or will be able to download to MAC also? I do not want to buy a CD,,"No, you just buy either Pc or MAC. (the price is the same). I just downloaded it using Firefox as Safari didn't work well. I also don't have a CD drive anymore, but this worked just fine. Hope this helps."
9867,open-ended,B00FFINRG6,Does anyone know what the extra charge is to e-file state (for Illinois specifically)?,,"Efiling a state return using the TurboTax desktop software is $19.99. There is no charge for NY electronic filing. Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax"

9874,yes/no,B00FFINRG6,Does this version include Form 8949 to file along with Schedule D? Please answer only if you've looked for Form 8949 in your installed Turbotax Deluxe,Y,"I just looked at my copy and found form 8949. I can't open it because I didn't use it but there is an option that states ""Forms(s) 8949 are created automatically, based on schedule D input."". So I'd say that the form is available in this version."
9875,open-ended,B00FFINRG6,Horrible experience with e-filing! checked state to download for 1 of 5 returns and now can't get rid of state for Washington state residents,,"Maybe try uninstalling and reinstalling the software?

9877,open-ended,B00FFIMBOA,So I can't use TurboTax basic if I have rental income to declare? I'll download TaxAct for free instead. I know I can claim rental income with that .,,"You can enter rental income. Within the income page is a line as I recall for rental income. In any case, rental income is ordinary income and there are ways to enter depreciation if needed. I used Turbo Tax Basic when I ran my one person IT business and it accommodated everything I needed, including depreciation. Prior to IT, I worked in a ""tax oriented"" or ""tax avoidance"" environment and am familiar with various income tax strategies and I believe that TurboTax is a full blown tax app. The higher priced versions add help, but are unnecessary if you pay attention to the income categories on the ""wages & income"" page."
9878,open-ended,B00FFIMBOA,Is this a CD or is it downloaded directly to the computer?,,It is downloaded directly to your computer.
9879,yes/no,B00FFIMBOA,Does Turbo Tax Basic lets you open your 2013 return?,N,No not unless you used turbo tax in 2013

9883,yes/no,B00FFIMBOA,does this include state filing?,?,"I'm pretty sure it does, but we don't have state income tax in my state, so I did not use it to file state tax. It seems like I remember seeing that option, though I wouldn't want to steer you wrong."
9884,open-ended,B00FFIMBOA,can I download this to my samsung tablet or is it only for PC,,PC only...
9885,yes/no,B00FFIMBOA,can I import 1099's,?,NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE
9886,open-ended,B00FFU8PDO,I have an older version. If I buy this will it automatically transfer all my personally input recipes?,,"Yes! Here's a link that explains how. There's even a video. http://support.mastercook.com/entries/22017556-Transferring-Recipes-and-Files-from-a-Previous-Version If for some reason the link won't post here, go to Mastercook (dot com) and look under support. Also, while there, check out the new web import so you can download recipes right off the web."
9887,yes/no,B00FFU8PDO,Can you input from an earlier version of Master Cook,Y,"yes, I have copied my cookbook from a previous version, no problem."
9888,yes/no,B00FFU8PDO,"Have downloaded the mastercook 7 on new computer but can not transfer the ""my cookbook"" files into it. Help.",?,"visit this community: The Wonders of new MasterCook 14 at http://community.cookinglight.com/archive/index.php/t-153395.html Thought it's for version 14, there are 2 great ladies there that can probably help you out, one of whom is a MasterCook support person."
9889,yes/no,B00FFU8PDO,Does this program create a shopping list based on recipes you choose to make in a week?,Y,Yes
9890,yes/no,B00FFU8PDO,Will this work on a mac laptop?,?,Not unless you are running it in Windows mode.
9891,yes/no,B00FFU8PDO,Can I import recipes I still have only in old MealMaster format?,?,"I believe that you can, read here for more information on this http://support.mastercook.com/entries/23044272-Different-Methods-of-Importing-Recipes-into-MasterCook"
9892,yes/no,B00FFU8PDO,Can one scan in recipes? My mother has a stack torn from magazines she uses; i am needing a software that supports a scan feature,?,"I have not personally tried this with Mastercook 14, but I was able to scan and save a text file using previous versions of Mastercook. I scanned, copied and pasted the text file into Mastercook using the Import Assistant feature. If I remember right this worked okay. I had to carefully review each recipe as the scanner did not always accurately scan fractions well. You can not directly scan a recipe using Mastercook. You will have to use a scanner and its software to accomplish the task. See: http://mc6help.tripod.com/ImportAssistant.htm I have not found a recipe program that automatically scans and saves recipes. I have found Mastercook to be the best for importing recipes as it uses Import Assistant or Mastercook Import with MC 14. Another bonus is the ability to spell check recipes before saving them. Hope this helps."
9893,yes/no,B00FFU8PDO,"If I purchase version 14 today, do I receive upgrade rights to the new version when released ?",?,Version 15 will not be out until the end of March or the first of April. I would recommend you check with mastercook.com support and ask them if about an update for 15 if you purchase 14 first. I wish I could tell you more but that is all I know but I do not believe Amazon would give you a free update. Hope this helps.
9894,open-ended,B00FFU8PDO,Can you print an index list of recipes by category? I never could figure out how to do this (or if it was even possible) in version11.,,"Yes, you can. It works the same in versions 5-14. Open your cookbook. Select Print/Publish Cookbook from the File menu. In the Print window that appears in the lower left add a checkmark to include Category Index. Remove the checkmark to include Recipes. Now print."
9895,yes/no,B00FFU8PDO,Can it work with Dragon Naturally Speaking?,?,My version 9 does; so I expect version 14 would.
9896,open-ended,B00FFZXQLK,Does this software come with a disk? If not can I buy it?,,"I am not certain. They offer the download option from their site. Because I wanted an actual disc, I ended up buying the package from Amazon (fully expecting a disc to be inside the box). What I received was a very attractive box..very much what you'd expect to see in a retail store. Looked great. When I opened the box, all I found was a SINGLE piece of paper...nothing else. The paper gave me the address of the site I should log onto, a telephone number to call in case there were problems with installation, and a Product Key Code. That was IT. I was pretty pissed off about the whole thing because I could have saved myself the extra steps of online purchase of the box by simply downloading the software in the first place. My anger was over the fact that I wasn't made aware of this upfront, and wasted days waiting for my ""software"" to arrive. That said, I have had no complaints about the product itself. I bought the version that is ""life time"" for the PC you install it on. In fact, I bought it a second time to install on a second PC. They also give you rights to re-install on a second PC in case you install it on a PC that shortly craps out. It's not intended to be installed on 2 PCs intended to run concurrently-- you'd need a second license for that. I've had no problems with the program...am actually happy with it. Just wish I had known I wouldn't be getting a disc. Could have just downloaded it the night I placed my order with Amazon. One thing...and this is awesome...these folks have incredible..and FREE..customer service and tech support. I kept one of their techs on the phone for 3 hours one night going over what I thought was a problem. Turned out to be a misunderstanding on my part (not a problem with the program). This guy was friendly, and hung in there all the way through. A real trooper and a kind soul. I don't know if a version is available that actually comes with a disc. Having used the product for about a year, turns out I didn't need the disc anyway---I can always download the program as often as needed from their site and use the code they provided (HANG ON TO THAT CODE). I am VERY happy with this product. Switched to it from the Norton stuff I had used for the past 8 years. I really like this product, and hope this information has been helpful. Joe R."
9897,yes/no,B00FFZXQLK,I have an Apple Imac PC .. will this work ?,?,"Sorry, I don't have an Imac,,Hence, I don't know.

9911,yes/no,B00FFZY17I,"Has anyone used both MixCraft and this software and make a comparison? Since they are in the same price range, I gues they are competing",Y,I have used both. I personally find Music Studio to be better. I ended up uninstalling Mixcraft all together. Music Studio is logically laid out and easy to use. If you know anything about DAWs that is... I also use Reaper from time to time but I always end up coming back to Samplitude Music Studio. I still run the old version 12 deluxe on my studio PC and those projects export flawlessly to the 2014 version.

9915,open-ended,B00FFZXTWG,"Since there is no disc in the package, what happens if I have to reformat my computer and I need to reinstall all my programs?",,I'd call Vipre's customer support for the answer and do it before you have a problem. You should have a backup cd or DVD which would have Vipre's on it but you will need the number for your copy of Vipre's. When you call Vipre's see if you can purchase a DVD.

A great deal if you use the same computer for several years; if you purchase new computers to try and keep up with technology you probably want to go a year at a time. It's a very highly rated product and works well in my experience so I don't think you'll go wrong w/VIPRE. I think I should reiterate, too - for a computer you'll run a long time go with lifetime, if you buy new computers often, do a year at a time and remember that lifetime updates apply only to the computer you download the product on initially."

9927,yes/no,B00FFZXXCW,Can you open and save vector files saved in .eps or .ai format?,?,"Hi I am able to open and save EPS and AI formats with version 9. For example, I just now opened Illustrator CS5 files which I saved in eps and ai format. I cannot say about later versions of Illustrator, Ai and Eps. However I occasionally download files from stock photo companies in victor format and am able to open them in Xara 9. Now if you do a search in Google for AI and eps compatibility you might find comments regarding exporting to AI and EPS. For example on one Xara forum here's what a user said ""If it is just plain vectors with no RGB effects like shadows, transparencies and extreme colour fills it will export to illy no problems. If there is loads of text then it will not be editable at all as each letter will import to Illy as a shape."" This particular quote was for an earlier version of Xara. On the shutterstock forum here is a snippet comment regarding Xara 9 ""I spoke with the Xara support and they told me that their .eps is compatible with Illustrator 8."" Obviously Xara is no Illustrator so I am sure there are features in AI which are not found in Xara. But in my case, when I want to do something quick and don't want to deal with Illustrator (of which I am less skilled) I use Xara. I've been using various versions of xara for over 10 years. Maybe even 15 years! Rowby"

9939,open-ended,B00FFZXQGK,What is superior about the Internet Security 2014 versus the Secure Anywhere 2014? Is the 2015 version that much better than the 2014?,,"secure anywhere = internet security + phone antivirus (useless); --&gt; well, your VIPRE updates itself anyways, so you can buy the 2012 version and it would still update to the latest one."

9947,open-ended,B00FH4PQSA,once downloaded can it only be used on that PC,,"I can't say. I have a PC and a Mac and I only use it on the PC, I know it's not compatible with the Mac. However I do use freeware, ""Handbrake"" and ""VLC Media"" on the PC because I find the PowerDirector incredibly un-intuitive and I've not even been able to produce a dvd with it. I do, however, make raw footage dvd's with Handbrake and then load them on the Mac and use Movie Maker to create the finished product. Bottom line, I wouldn't buy PowerDirector again. But that's just me."

9956,yes/no,B00FJIBVE2,does print shop 3.5 work with windows 8.1?,Y,"It is supposed to work with Windows 8.1 and that's what I have on my computer. I just couldn't get this version of Print Shop to do anything for me. I don't think it was the operating system but rather the software. It is horrible, they removed many of the options that the older version Print Shop had. I was so disappointed in it that I don't even try to use it anymore. I managed to get my old version downloaded onto the 8.1 and I am happier with it. I prefer to deal with the occasional glitch from system incompatibility. I really hated the new version of Print Shop and would have returned it if I could have. Print Shop should be ashamed for releasing that version."
9957,open-ended,B00FJIBVE2,Is there any Print Shop or Print Master program that will run on Windows 8.1?,,"I was having many issues with Printshop on Windows 8.1 after the update. I could not get it running after many e-mails back and forth with Printshop support. I gave up after awhile. I recently tried installing Printshop 3.5 Deluxe after more recent updates to both the Printshop program and Windows 8.1 and now it works fine. Of course, both of them will probably say it was the other program causing the issues."

I haven't tried to make my less fuzzy, I just re-type whatever I'm doing into my new Printshop. Or I use Notepad or Word. I think I still have 1 that I use, but plan to reprint it as soon as I have the time. Sorry I can't help you on this. Seems like there should be a way, but I even tried different fonts and it didn't change the fuzziness. Charlene"
9960,yes/no,B00FJIBVE2,is it compatible with windows 8.1,?,"Absolutely. That's why I bought it. I was a big fan of Print Shop version 6 for XP. I do not recommend the new version, however. I have switched to Serf Page Plus."
9961,open-ended,B00FJIBVE2,how to fix out of memory to save photos,,"As a computer repair technician, I don't believe this is a program problem. Out of Memory to save a photo usually refers to the lack of storage space available on your systems Hard Drive or storage device you are attempting to save the photo to. All storage devices have max amount of space. You can check the available space by finding the device or hard drive in the My Computer area and right mouse click on it, then go to properties and it will show you used and available space. Hope this helps."
9962,yes/no,B00FJIBVE2,is it like 3.0?,?,"Unfortunately, it is not. In fact I deleted it a requested a refund from the company. Better choice would be Print Artist Gold 25. It's still not as good and does not have a ""table maker"" but it is far better than the PS 3.5. Hope that helps."

I switch between the two regularly. (2) No it is NOT an exact replica. VS 2013 is very close but there are GUI differences especially relating to Cloud services, Notification/Upgrades, and integration with MS Cloud based VS Team Foundation.

Wit the different devices you've listed. Check with them direct! Here's a link to their contact page: http://www.webroot.com/us/en/company/contact-us"
9990,open-ended,B00FZ0FETC,how to renew,,"Found this website: http://www.webroot.com/us/en/renewal, but I'm guessing that you could just repurchase from amazon and use the new product key they email you to activate it. They will include a link for you to get where you need in the email as I recall."
9991,open-ended,B00FZ0FETC,Do you need this and will it work on a Chromebook?,,"Google's blog says that the Chromebook has security built in, in many layers, so that an antivirus isn't needed."

9995,open-ended,B00FZ0FETC,i ordered the wrong webroot and it wont load on my windows computer,,"Try to get your money back. 9 Out of ten times Whn I have a problem with something I ordered online, after writing the seller. I gave me a partial or full refund or they may offer the right one as an exchange. Good luck."
9996,yes/no,B00FZ0FETC,Will I need to remove the virus program currently installed? (Norton),?,"That would be your best bet. I always remove all of my I.S. & Virus systems when installing a COMPLETE all-in-one product such as Webroot (or, any other all-in-one that you may have previously installed), as it has a built-in anti-virus system. If you don't remove your previous system, you could run into future problems of both systems trying to work...and they could end up working against each other."
9997,yes/no,B00FZ0FK0U,Will it also cover windows 8.1?,N,"It works fine. No problems, I ust switched to widows 8.1 did not see any changes."

(In case I get another computer or device).,,"I have purchased 5 device protection, and I can add at any time a new device up to a total of 5. You have 365 days of protection from the first addition (double check with Webroot, I do not think it starts with the purchase date). You do not get a full year for the last device if you add it after the first device addition to the plan. I have used one 5 device purchase with tablets, computers and netbooks all at once. Like this company very much, seems to stop all viruses/problems, and I am on some sites occasionally that have known viruses."
9999,yes/no,B00FZ0FK0U,"I have 43 days left on current webroot software. If I purchase and load now, will it begin after current webroot software expires ?",N,"No. In my experience, you have to uninstall the old version before you can install the new one unless u buy it directly from Webroot. So you would forfeit any time remaining on your old sub. What I do is wait until a couple days before the old sub expires to buy and download the new version."
10000,yes/no,B00FZ0FK0U,"I have Plus now, if I buy Complete, will that work as an upgrade?",?,Sure.
10001,yes/no,B00FZ0FK0U,If I already have webroot installed (expires in 10 days) can I download this version Webroot wants 79.00 for the renewal.,?,"Yes, you definitely can. I had the same confusion actually. All you have to do is purchase the product on Newegg. After you have the program security key, open your Webroot secure anywhere software and click on the small gear next to ""my account."" You can then copy and paste your code into the activate new keycode field. All set."
10002,open-ended,B00FZ0FK0U,Does this work for XP? If not is there one that works for XP?,,"Yes, This software is compatible with Windows XP.

I love this program, it did not slow down my computer or continuously bug me with updates. It completely works behind the scenes."
10004,open-ended,B00FZ0FK0U,Does the year start with the first download on the download or is it separate for each device? what about the disc?,,"The year starts with the first installation and activation of the code that comes with the software. The nice thing is you can buy these when they are discounted and use the codes when needed. When you use the code, they work for the latest version of the software."
10005,yes/no,B00FZ0FK0U,"If purchase, does it send me the product key same time, because i have a cd",Y,"Yes it does. It is cloud-based, so it takes very little space on your computer and loads very quickly. I'm very pleased with the results."

The FBI Moneypak virus has been known to hit kindles, but in each case is the result of an infected email, side loading apps, or rooting their device. To answer your question, Yes Webroot will work on the Kindle Fire. However I've read that device administration is denied to third party apps do some features may not work."
10010,yes/no,B00FZ0E0HE,Does this software protect against adware?,Y,Yes it does. I haven't had any ads pop up since I have gotten this software.
10011,open-ended,B00FZ0E0HE,I currently have kaspersky but it doesn't protect my internet searches. Does this replace all my antiviruses or can I use both?,,"I don't know about Kapersky, but SecureAnywhere runs just fine along side McAfee. McAfee did notice it was there and said something weekly stated about it not being wise (or words to that effect) to run two antivirus programs at the same time. That being said SecureAnywhere found and dealt with trogans and keystroke recorders that McAfee never detected. I work in a school district with old computers running XP and using a flashdrive to transfer yearbook related materials to my home computer is where my difficulties have arisen."

There is one point of contention that I have with the software. It seems through my experience with the product is that it holds any viruses in quaranteen so they cannot effect your system. However, once you de-install the software package, the viruses come back onto your system. When I reinstalled the new secureanywhere version, the system scans for viruses again and holds them again. I would perfer that it would kill the virus program itself, but that could effect the registry part of your computer and not allow it to work properly as it could delete a .dll file that your system needs, and the virus needs at the same time. So this is the reason that it puts the virus program in quaranteen. With continued subscription, it was worked fine."

10073,yes/no,B00G0DXA9Y,"I have a PC, am i at the right location for download?",?,"You probably are at the right place to purchase a download of the tax program. This can be frustrating because you will get a link to click on that will start the download to your computer. Then you will have to select ""Save"" or ""Run"" (or you can do both). The program is saved to your download folder. You will need to click on ""Run"" to begin the installation program. When it is installed, you will need to open the program which will give you an opportunity to update the program (it will not run without updates of the federal program). It will probably take you a half-an-hour to do this. If you are not familiar with downloading and installing programs, I suggest you either get someone to do this for you, or go to Staples, Wal-Mart or Sam's Club and buy a disc and install it yourself. You can do it, just don't be disturbed by the possibility that you might mess up something. That is pretty hard to do, and you can probably download again if somehow the download is interrupted. You know, if you have a simple tax return, I would be inclined to use one of the online free tax programs. Even H&R Block has one you can use online. If this is your first return, then that might meet your needs. I stay mad at H&R because they do not offer returning customers their best price, but make you hunt on the internet, watch for sales or deal with rebates. Not the way I would treat my customers."

Since MS is dropping S&amp;T, I'm looking for a new program for trip planning.",,"DeLorme Street Atlas USA Plus 2014 HAS maps for US and Canada, and DOES DO trip planning. So if you had it, you would not need MS Streets & Trips. If MS is dropping S&Ts, don't waste your time with it. I am sure it is NOT compatible with DeLorme. Street Atlas 2014 has an amazing capability and number of features. Add a GPS sensor and you have the complete package. This is the way I went, and am very satisfied."
10084,open-ended,B00G0PPX10,"Can you enter a number of stops or waypoints and then have the program optimize the route, taking into account hours to travel each day?",,I'm not sure. I believe you can. The problem is that this is the worst software I have ever purchased. I seldom use it because it is so cumbersome to do anything with it.
10085,yes/no,B00G0PPX10,is the antenna included in the box,N,"Not this particular product. You'll have to buy the antenna separate, or buy the Street Atlas that includes the antenna. They run around $50."

10091,yes/no,B00G212LOY,I don't have a DVD Rom or CD drive on my laptop. Is there a different way to download the program other than DVD/CD discs?,?,"You can download it directly from their website using the Code/Key provided on the program's box that you purchase. Although I have a CD-rom on my laptop, the disk wouldn't load, so I had to download it from their website which proved successful."
10092,yes/no,B00G212LOY,Will this program work on an ipad?,Y,Yes. The program comes with a audio CD for iPhone/iPad/iPod/ mp3. There is also a downloadable version which you can copy to the iPad. Instructions are fairly clear.

I don't recall the neeed to install the english at all. I just followed the install directions and the whole program installed.
10097,open-ended,B00G212LOY,What version of Mac will this work on?,,"I have Mavericks OS 10.9.4 and it works fine. I don't know how far back it goes. The box it came in was destroyed in our earthquake so I don't have the Mac specs handy, but I would guess it might go back as far as Snow Leopard, maybe earlier, but that is just a guess. Is it not supplied with the sales specs for the product? Sorry, I don't have more info handy at this time. I do have to say that I have moved on to Rosetta Stone. They have a terrific sale (50% and I bought the full program Levels I-V for about $250. Don't know if it's still on, but I received it just before the quake.

10122,open-ended,B00G6E60X0,whic is the diference between the normal and the elite edition?...the normal will work fine with my ricoh gr?,,"Hello, between both editions is no difference in functinality. The difference is in the number of cameras and lenses which are supported in either edition. If you camera is on the list of supported optical modules in the Standard edition, you should be fine with it. To make sure that your equipment is supported, please check in advance on the DxO website: http://www.dxo.com/intl/photography/dxo-optics-pro/supported-equipment With kind regards, Heike Precht Support Team DxO Labs"
10123,open-ended,B00G6E60X0,Doe this version have the modules for Sony a77?,,"Yes, probably. They now have the Leica and Nikon raw file formats. So I would guess Sony is there too."
10124,yes/no,B00G6E60X0,"Will it support cameras used in the 1930s and 1940s, to improve old family photos?",?,"DxO can process scans of photographs taken with older cameras, but much of the true magic of DxO is not available to captures made with vintage gear. Let me explain. DxO is a powerful image editor, true. But the full power of DxO is only available when you process files that come DIRECTLY FROM DIGITAL CAMERAS, and that contain information about lens type, focal length, aperture, etc. that is embedded in the digital files when they are uploaded to your computer. Further functionality is gained when these files are raw files (some capitalize it as ""RAW,"" but this is an error), which have a capacity for capturing a wider dynamic range (from the darkest dark, to the lightest light) in the scene. When the photo is a scanned image, or a jpg received 2nd-hand (say, in an email, or downloaded from Facebook), DxO is limited to standard image adjustments available in most photo-editors. The way it works, is DxO tests hundreds of camera bodies (sensors) and lenses, and creates special profiles that it uses to automatically sharpen and adjust for distortion and aberration in captures taken by everything from iPhones to lens+camera combinations costing in the tens of thousands of dollars. When you upload a file right from the source into your computer, DxO reads the digital metadata (EXIF) data in it, compares it with a profile downloaded from the DxO site, and automatically makes adjustments (further, manual adjustments are possible) based on the profile for your gear. Since there is no way to get this information for a photo taken with, for example, a vintage Leica or Nikon into the computer and DxO, there is no way for DxO to do this kind of magic for you on a vintage camera. I hope this helps!"

10135,open-ended,B00GAIMXR4,Can you install the OS on the physical machine and the VM and have two separate domains?,,You can install it on as many physical or VMs and have separate domains but you will need a license for each install. I think you have 30-days to activate.

The product comes shrink-wrapped and contains every thing you need to install Finale on your PC/Mac. This product is the academic edition for students which is approximately a $300 discount. Luckily you can get the academic edition for $100 dollars less. The difference between retail and academic edition is that the academic edition's license is non-transferable."

My notion was that this was for teaching Finale in the classroom for composition or arrangement, that makes a lot more sense I think. Why isn't that possible instead of paying $150 per license? I get it, they need to make money, but my school isn't exactly rolling in the dough."

I have loaded over 500 recipes in the last two weeks. I'm primarily doing a copy & past from my Paprika App on my iMac Computer. So I have not tried many of the functions as of this time. The following are some of my problems thus far: 1. My computer will freeze up about 5 times a day and I have to force quit and reopen Cook'n. 2. Also it will quit and close bye it self every other day. ( I do sent a report every time this happens) 3. I can't print what you see on the screen. The print command will change the background. 4. The PDF conversion in the print command will change the background theme from what you normally will see on the screen. 5. Needs to have better help files, like step by step how to do it tutorials. With all the above problems I like the software and hope these will be fixed. I'm only two weeks into it and still learning. (Also I'm 78 and it might take me a little longer) My question: Need a step by step on how to create a CD or DVD to take to Office Depot to have a cookbook printed."
10171,open-ended,B00GNI9RSE,"How many recipes have been stored in the original software before any thing imported by user ? Or it's a organizer only, no recipes preloaded?",,There is a cook book already loaded. You can make your own adding recipes or purchase other digital cookbooks. The home page provides new recipes all the time that you can save easily. I have found this software very easy and love finding lots of new recipes everyday. Easy to capture recipes from almost any source.
10172,open-ended,B00GNI9RSE,Will this version work with Windows 8? What is the difference between this Cook.n 11 and the Cook.n 11 for $79.95?,,"I don't use Windows 8 so I have no first hand input. The manual states ""PC System Requirements -- Windows 8/7/Vista/XP -- 1GB RAM -- CD ROM -- 300 MB HD space"" I would assume it would work on Win 8, contact the creator of the software at http://www.dvo.com/contact.html if you want knowledgeable support in this part of your question. I don't understand the second part of your question. I would think that Cook'n 11 refers to one program and there would be no difference if it was created by the same company (DVO Enterprises). I purchased my copy from Amazon and it is the same package that I would have received if ordered from DVO Enterprises."
10173,open-ended,B00GNI9RSE,What is the difference between this version and the $68.13 version by DVO Enterprises? Does this one work with Win 8?,,"To my knowledge there is no difference. Sometimes when searching products on Amazon, I've found prices on exact products differ greatly, depending on the individual companies selling the item. As for working with Win 8 - I'm not sure but there is a Cook'n Version 11 review on the Amazon site that says they are using it with 8 so I would assume it's the same program but you can check that review out to be safe. Good luck and hope you enjoy Cook'n as much as I do!"
10174,open-ended,B00GNI9RSE,Has the help support and synchronizing of this software been corrected? I am looking to purchase but main concern is the synchronizing.,,The support via email has been great..usually a 1day response time. The synch seems to work quite well and I have the app on my android phone with all of my recipes (which is great when shopping!)
10175,open-ended,B00GNI9RSE,Could somebody please tell me if this is the exact same version 11 of Cook'n that is from the DVO Enterprises for the $79.95?,,"Version 11 should be Version 11 in all cases, regardless of where it is purchased..."
10176,yes/no,B00GNI9RSE,I do not have a cd-rom drive. Is this purchase for a site to download the software?,?,I have the CD but you can send and email to this gentleman and he would be happy to answer your question. He has been very helpful with any questions I have had. danieloaks@dvo.com
10177,open-ended,B00GOUBT6E,Do you know if 4 GB of memory is sufficient to run this 32 bit version on a PC from 2007?,,"Yes, it is. I have 4 GB on my machine (this one) and it runs just fine."
10178,yes/no,B00GOUBT6E,"The product title says ""32bit"" but the picture says ""64bit"", is this really the 32bit version?",?,Mine said 32 bit and I had no problems loading it.
10179,open-ended,B00GOUBT6E,what is clean install,,"This means loaded on a formatted hard drive. It's not necessary, though. If you can't format the drive, which most Windows operating systems will not let you do, just put the CD in and power-up. After starting, you'll get a command prompt to load from the CD. Then during the early part of the load, a box will come up saying your existing files will be saved in a folder named ""old files"" or something similar. Just O.K. that and continue."
10180,open-ended,B00GOUBT6E,I want to make sure before I purchase this that it is a 32 bit installation. The picture shows 64.,,"well, the description must state that it is 32 bit. And if your system can run windows 7 it should work. That is what I did and now I am running windows 7 on my desktop that came with windows vista...hope that helps"
10181,yes/no,B00GOUBT6E,can you do a clean install and still keep files and programs already on system. My system is windows xp which has stopped working,?,"I was able to save all pics and some of my desktop items. But your best to move everything to a flash stick, or a disk of some sort just to be safe."
10182,yes/no,B00GOUBT6E,"my windows xp ran media center, does windows 7 home premium have media center?",?,It includes Media Player 12
10183,open-ended,B00GOUBT6E,"I would like to upgrade to this version of Windows, I'm currently using Vista. How can I retain my MS Office and other installed program in my laptop?",,"From Vista (32 bit) you should be able to upgrade and everything will transfer over. Your system should meet all the minimum requirements for Win 7 if it was running Vista, check this page http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/system-requirements to make sure. If you buy this and find it won't upgrade, you won't totally lose the value of buying Windows 7 as you can also do a 'clean' install that would require you to reinstall Office and others. However, you should backup your important files before you upgrade, just to be safe."
10184,yes/no,B00GOUBT6E,Can I use tgis software in my HP Mini 210-2090NR?,?,"I have installed on many 10""computers but if your still in doubt, contact HP. Go to there website, they advertise there phone number"
10185,yes/no,B00GOUBT6E,Can OS software be reinstalled on a replacement hard drive following a fatal hard disk crash?,Y,"Yes it is a full operating system disk, you may have to find a few drivers but most of the time it has them all. I bought this disk just for that purpose for a full reinstall to a damaged hard drive."
10186,yes/no,B00GOUBT6E,can I safely upgrade windows xp to windows 7 ?,?,"Yes and no. This is for a new install. You will need to back up your data, and confirm all your software, hardware will work. There is a free program that will check your unit out at Microsoft. Download it run it and it will tell you what will or will not work. (Never had a problem upgrading a machine) Hope this helps."
10187,open-ended,B00GRFIIHO,is i mac compatible? AirPlay compatible?,,"This is an app for Mac. It does not have in-app AirPlay compatibility unfortunately. As noted in one of the comments to the reviews, you can use the system-wide AirPlay (option-click on the volume button to enable this), but that routes all of your computer's sounds through AirPlay instead of just music. In-app AirPlay would be a huge improvement."
10188,yes/no,B00GRFIIHO,can the Mac app import my iTunes library?,?,"I tried it with a mac, you can import purchasss from amazon music to itunes, but no the other way around"
10189,open-ended,B00GRFIIHO,How do I add .wma files to Amazon Music with Prime Music [Mac],,I doubt it. They may have to be converted to the right file format. There are two main ways to attempt to convert a WMA file to another file type:Two ways of doing it is by: - Open the WMA file in its default program and choose to save the open file as another file format. - Use a FILE CONVERSION ONLINE SERVICE OR SOFTWARE PROGRAM to convert the WMA file to another file format.
10190,yes/no,B00GRFIIHO,Can I add an mp3 song I got from the Web?,N,"Not to Amazon Cloud Player. They used to let you upload mp3s to the cloud but they disabled the feature. (following the lead of mac/itunes to keep eveything proprietary) it's bs...but one workaround I figured is to use google drive to upload your music and there is a nice little app called gdrive (an additional app) that makes it easy to move mp3s to/from the cloud, it also has its own music player. The scam here is to force you RE-buy music you already own in order to listen to it on the go. don't let amazon or mac do this to you."
10191,open-ended,B00GRFIIHO,I have an ipad so do I download the mac version?,,"There is an Amazon Music With Prime Music in the App Store on your iPad (it's free). Download that on your iPad. If you want the Prime Music App to use on your Mac computer, then download the Mac Version."
10192,yes/no,B00GRFIIHO,Will this work for ipad,Y,"Yes, it works on mime...."
10193,yes/no,B00GRFIIHO,can i sync with amazon music on android,?,Yes just select music on device and any music found will be added to your library
10194,yes/no,B00GRFIIHO,Can it be used with IPad mini?,?,"Hi Wendy, it works with my IPAD2 with No problems, just download the app. Also, use the Prime Music to hear many songs for free, I particularly like the workout tracks. Enjoy."
10195,yes/no,B00GRFIIHO,Can it be loaded to iphone 4s?,Y,yes
10196,open-ended,B00GRFIIHO,"So Where is Kindle for Mac, for OXS Yosemite. Search only brings me to Amazon music?",,Go to the App Store and search kindle and it will come up
10197,open-ended,B00GUXLRCQ,"I have used Quicken for about 15 to 20 years. Its hard to teach an old dog a new trick, how close to quicken operations is iBanks 5 program in day to operations. I write several checks each day.",,"I was also a very long term quicken user, but i could not stand quicken's mac version after i switched to mac in 2007, & running a virtual windows machine just to run the windows version of quicken was just too much of a pain. i've been with ibank since version 3. it was miles better than mac's quicken & it gets better and better with each new release. it does function a bit differently than quicken so there will be a small learning curve, nothing drastic though. ibank5 is perhaps not as polished as the current windows version of quicken, but i am pretty sure from what i've read that there has been no great improvement of quicken's mac product. intuit is dropping the ball there. i'd say give ibank5 a shot, you likely won't regret it. i know i don't, not one bit."
10198,yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,Will this program work outside the US?,?,"iBank 5 is a global product, sold in every territory via the Mac App Store (though amazon limits purchases to U.S. customers). iBank offers full multi-currency support, downloads investments from foreign exchanges, and connects to over 10,000 banks worldwide via its optional subscription service, Direct Access. It works wherever your Mac does."
10199,yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,is there a workaround for ibank 5s lack of a classification function,?,"Yes, there are workarounds - although not a clone of Quicken's classification feature, which is what I assume you refer to. Instead of Quicken's class tag, you can use a separate extended category name, e.g. stationery/work-related, to distinguish work-related stationery from other stationery purchases, the solidus or slash representing the start of what would be the classification tag in Quicken. Edit tax-related and other properties as necessary in iBank Manage&gt;Categories. If you are coming to iBank from Quicken, this approach has the advantage of being consistent with how iBank imports classified Quicken transactions from a QIF transfer file. You can also set up in Manage&gt;Categories a group name, e.g. Stationery, and then subsidiary category names under that, including counterparts for the classifications you might have applied in Quicken, e.g. Stationery - personal, Stationery - work-related, Stationery - project-related, etc."
10200,yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,Can I transfer dat from IBank into TurboTax?,Y,"Yes. You can code tax-related transactions in iBank with a built-in set of U.S. tax codes, then export data to a TXF file for use with TurboTax or other popular tax prep software."
10201,open-ended,B00GUXLRCQ,how does it do with importing QIF files from quicken?,,"I successfully imported to iBank 14 years of data as a QIF from Quicken for Mac 2007, and had my chart of accounts come over fully, and every account balance accurately to the very last cent. Some minor cleanup was necessary to fix things like foreign currency symbols in which Quicken is not Mac-compliant. It was useful to carefully check my Quicken file to remove spurious transactions, and run Quicken's file rebuild routine, before creating the QIF for import, to repair file corruption for which Quicken for Mac is notorious. Migrating my accounting to iBank has been the easiest and most accurate such process I have experienced. Read the manual topic on import, run through the online tutorial, work through the process carefully, with backup data so you can revert if you make a mistake, and it should be easy for you, too."
10202,yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,Can you merge Microsoft Money with iBank?,?,"Presumably you mean, ""Can you export Microsoft Money data for import to iBank?"" According to the iBank user manual, yes, you can. The iBank 5 user manual refers to importing data from Microsoft Money, in part, as follows: ""iBank can import transaction data from the following file formats: QIF (Quicken Interchange Format), OFX (Open Financial Exchange, most commonly used by Microsoft Money), QFX (Quicken File Exchange, also known as Web Connect format), QMTF (Quicken Mac Transfer Format, used by Quicken Essentials), and CSV (Comma-Separated Values, most commonly used with Excel and other spreadsheet programs)."" The best way to proceed is to check your version of Microsoft Money for the file export options it supports, and try out one or more of the available export/import options between Microsoft Money and iBank 5. Always work with backup files when migrating data as important as personal financial accounts. Do not overwrite or delete your original data. Tackle the job when you are wide awake and unlikely to be distracted or interrupted. Check the transferred balances, and account and category names and structure, carefully against your Microsoft Money file. Some minor adjustments and cleanup might be necessary for differences between the source application and iBank, such as chart of account structure and names, and foreign language or currency symbols. This is sometimes the case when transferring data between different applications: complex file exchange data across an entire set of accounts is rarely exactly the same as data native to the originating or destination application. In my experience, iBank has been particularly good at accurately importing data from Quicken in QIF format -- a financial data exchange format which I understand is supported by at least some versions of the discontinued Microsoft Money. Ignore the negative comments and attacks on iBank: the naysayers haven't got a clue. iBank 5 is by far the most capable and reliable full-featured personal finance software which has yet appeared for the Mac OS."
10203,yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,can you import credit card purchases and sort by vendor,Y,Yes and you can search transactions.
10204,yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,can I use this software to replace Quicken 2002 basic which I use mainly to write checks??,?,"I currently use iBank 4 -- I assume this answer will also apply to iBank 5 (which I plan to upgrade to). I migrated from Quicken (Mac) and I have used iBank to record, and even print, checks (using the paper blank check forms that I have used literally for decades to print checks). It may call for some tweaking of the check field settings but it was easy to do and has worked flawlessly for more than a year now."
10205,yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,is there a spanish version of ibank 5 ?,Y,"iBank is fully compliant with the excellent built-in foreign language support of the Mac OS, and its multiple currency features work with every currency I know in the Spanish-speaking world (in contrast to Quicken for Mac lack of these features). The iBank application is available only with menus, report titles, and user manual in English, but it is easy to enter payee descriptions and memos in Spanish, and to record transactions in local currencies -- exactly as I have done for my recent travels in Spain, Argentina and Chile. It is easy to set up and maintain an iBank file with the home currency set to any currency of Spanish-speaking countries. Spanish account and category names also can be used when setting up the chart of accounts."
10206,yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,Can I transfer from Microsoft My Money ?,Y,"Yes. iBank's set-up assistant will help you to install QIF files exported by your copy of Microsoft Money, transferring data including accounts, transactions, categories and investments."
10207,yes/no,B00GVFI028,Can this be loaded on a computer without a DVD drive? I have an ultrabook (like a macbook air).,Y,"You can use ""sharing"" from another computer on the network. Nat Geo, on the 110 Year Edition came in a version that was already on an external HDD. It was more expensive, but would work (and save space). http://shop.nationalgeographic.com/ngs/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=2000089"
10208,open-ended,B00GVFI028,Are these scans of the magazines or just articles and the respective photos? Looking for the advertisements that were the printed format.,,"Hi Brad, what you will get is a scanned version. I have to say as well, that I was quite dissatisfied with the quality. You will also need a special program from adobe for watching. It is free though. You will need about 50 GB of space on your PC to upload it all. However it is complete and includes the advertisements."
10209,yes/no,B00GVFI028,Does the set also include the maps that came with each issue?,?,"No, and don't buy this! It is so loaded with adware it's ridiculous. The adware is so difficult to remove that computer techs refer to it as malware, and it has to be removed by a technician, which in my case cost over $100. This set is a pc bomb just waiting to ruin your pc."
10210,open-ended,B00GVFI028,qDo you know if it runs on windows 8.1?,,Yes it does.
10211,open-ended,B00GVFI028,why can't I install National Geographic 125 years on Windows 7? I get the error message the installer file is damaged?,,"I don't know why you can't install it; I've had no trouble and I have Windows 7, too. I have the 64-bit version. I don't know if that makes a difference, but mine runs very well."
10212,yes/no,B00GVFI028,Does it run on Version 10.6.8 Mac OS X?,?,"Gilbert, I can't help as this was for a gift to someone with a pc."
10213,open-ended,B00GWH3CK0,how many seats does the software license include? can I install this on more than 1 PC?,,Actually you can install the software on your laptop and your desktop as long as you only use one at a time
10214,open-ended,B00GWH3CK0,"The description at the top where it lists Platform states Windows 7 AND Mac OSX. If I buy this, do I get both versions, or do I have to pick one?",,Both OS's are supported by this software. When you get your Filemaker software you can install it on either a Mac or Windows computer and it will work great. The version installed is the determined by the Operating system that is running when you run the installer.
10215,yes/no,B00GWH3CK0,will this run on windows 8.1?,Y,Yes it does.
10216,yes/no,B00GWH3CK0,Do I have to purchace the licence?,Y,"If you purchase the software it comes with a license. You might have to purchase additional licenses if you wish to have multiple users of the software, for example giving access to a company database on several different employees computers."
10217,yes/no,B00GWH3CK0,"how many users are authorized to use this, can multiples be installed on other PCs",?,"I believe a maximum of 5 users can use FileMaker, but it can only be installed on one PC."
10218,open-ended,B00GWH3CK0,I have all my older files in FmP7. I am now on OSX 7.5. How can I save or convert the data??,,"It doesn't look like you need any in-between from version 7.5 to version 13. 12 & 13 use the fmp12 format so you should be able to open files save from version 7 in version 13 and save as the new format. Always backup your files before converting. If you run into trouble, you always have your backups to go back to. If you don't understand any issues that come up in the conversion log, you should hire someone who really knows filemaker if you don't know what you're doing. Here are instructions straight from filemaker: http://help.filemaker.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/10571/~/converting-older-filemaker-pro-files-to-the-.fmp12-file-format"
10219,yes/no,B00GWH3CK0,Does it work with Android?,?,"Not directly. FileMaker can be used a backend database for a web site that could be accessed via Android but you need to be a pretty accomplished web developer to make that happen. FileMaker runs native on Windows, Mac OS, and iOS (iPad/iPhone)."
10220,yes/no,B00GWH3CK0,"Since this seems to be so Microsoft integrated, will the data hold its integrity on the Linux-based systems also?",?,I have not used Linux based systems so I don't know. But I do use FileMaker all day at work on both the PC and Mac. Same database and information and it works just fine. Sorry I could not be more helpful.
10221,yes/no,B00GWH3CK0,"If I buy pro 13 on Amazon, can I have it as a downloadable version instead of waiting for the package? Thank you!",?,"Hello, we only offer CD version. Not sure if others have a diwnloadbble."
10222,yes/no,B00GWH3C0A,Am I able to upgrade from 10 to v. 13?,Y,"Yes, according to this: http://goo.gl/Z3M9Mn"
10223,yes/no,B00GWH3C0A,"running OS 10.5 and have 8.5 installed. if upgrade to 13, will i incur any problems. 8.5 keeps crashing",N,"You need to read the specs at http://www.filemaker.com/products/filemaker-pro/conversion.html to find out your route for conversion of the current files. Once they are converted, they should work fine (assuming there are not data problems)."
10224,open-ended,B00GWH3C0A,what version do you have to have in order to upgrade ?,,"Sorry...correction the last three versions...10, 11, or 12. http://www.filemaker.com/purchase/store/buying_faq.html"
10225,yes/no,B00GWH3C0A,Will this upgrade from FileMaker 6?,?,I don't know but I doubt it. The best thing to do for an answer is contact Filemaker. Good luck.
10226,open-ended,B00GWH3C0A,"what version of Mac OS X do I need, Lion? 10.7.5?",,FileMaker 13 requires OS X 10.7.0 or newer or Windows 7.0 or newer.
10227,open-ended,B00GWH3C0A,Is this an upgrade or a new install?,,"Hi Greg, This is an upgrade. You must have an earlier version installed, or, I think, the serial number from an earlier version. I'm an Engineer and a Realtor. I write all kinda of databases to streamline my life and business. Don't know what I'd do without it. It should be a standard on every computer."
10228,yes/no,B00GWH3C0A,"do you get the CD and the manual, I do not want the download version",?,"When you get the boxed version, it does have the CD and a starter manual."
10229,open-ended,B00GWH3C0A,How many users/seats is this for?,,On Amazon you can not purchase volume licenses...so these are all single user copies. You'll need to contact an authorized FileMaker Business Alliance member to purchase discounted licenses for more that 5 users. See the following explanation http://cimbura.com/tech/2013/10/18/filemaker-licensing-made-easy/
10230,open-ended,B00GWH3C0A,What is meant by Upgrade Retail Box? Is the software complete?,,"This is only suitable for upgrading an earlier version of FileMaker Pro (version 10, 11, or 12). You must have the earlier version loaded on your computer AND the license key to do the upgrade. If you do not have version 10, 11, or 12, you will have to purchase the full version of FMP 13, not the Upgrade."
10231,yes/no,B00GXW40ZU,do you have to purchase a new product every year,Y,"Yes, as you are paying for the service along with the product."
10232,open-ended,B00GXW40ZU,What if you need to file more returns? Do you have to purchase another turbo tax?,,We have filed five returns for members of our family from . one turbo tax.

10234,yes/no,B00GXW40ZU,"I want to buy the disc to compare Turbo Tax to the return prepared and filed by my accountant, mostly for future reference. Can I print for future reference and not file? I could save a lot of money for future returns if the returns prove similar.",Y,"Yes, You can save your returns as PDF file and without filing it with IRS"

10236,open-ended,B00GXW40ZU,works on windows 8.1?,,Yes it works on windows 8.1
10237,yes/no,B00GXW40ZU,Will this product be good to prepare both the 1120 and the 1040?,N,"No, you will need TurboTax Business version to file form 1120. The Home &Business version is for your personal return. No, I'm sorry. TurboTax Business will not prepare Form 1120-F. Certain Cash Contributions for Typhoon Haiyan Relief Efforts in the Philippines Can Be Deducted on Your 2013 Tax Return A new law allows you to choose to deduct certain charitable contributions of money on your 2013 tax return instead of your 2014 return. The contributions must have been made after March 25, 2014, and before April 15, 2014, for the relief of victims in the Republic of the Philippines affected by the November 8, 2013, typhoon. Contributions of money include contributions made by cash, check, money order, credit card, charge card, debit card, or via cell phone. The new law was enacted after the 2013 forms, instructions, and publications had already been printed. When preparing your 2013 tax return, you may complete the forms as if these contributions were made on December 31, 2013, instead of in 2014. The contribution must be made to a qualified organization and meet all other requirements for charitable contribution deductions. However, if you made the contribution by phone or text message, a telephone bill showing the name of the donee organization, the date of the contribution, and the amount of the contribution will satisfy the recordkeeping requirement. Therefore, for example, if you made a $10 charitable contribution by text message that was charged to your telephone or wireless account, a bill from your telecommunications company containing this information satisfies the recordkeeping requirement."
10238,yes/no,B00GXW40ZU,Can I use the Turbo Tax home and business to prepare form 1120 for my S corporation and then use it for my personal ITx,N,I'm really not sure. I would suggest that she pose that question to the Turbo Tax Support Assistance.
10239,yes/no,B00GXW40ZU,does this include unlimited state filings?,?,One state only.
10240,yes/no,B00GXW46N6,Can I purchase this and use it for an amended tax return for 2013? I originally used the Turbo Tax Deluxe 2013 online edition without download.,?,"I previously had to do an amended return with Turbo Tax and since I keep all of my disc's, I did not have a problem. You may have to input all of the original data into the 2013 version and click on amended return. Good Luck"
10241,yes/no,B00GXW46N6,CAN YOU FILE SCHEDULE C ON TT DELUXE 2013 VERSION,N,"According to Intuit TurboTax website, you would need to purchase TurboTax Home and Business----that is according to their comparison chart. TurboTax Deluxe does not do Schedule C."
10242,yes/no,B00GXW46N6,"I actually plan to do 2014 taxes. The old 2013 version may be good guidance ONLY if it allows Schedule B, C, calculations. Does it?Please let me know",Y,"I have used Turbotax since the 1980's and yes, if you enter the information on your interest and dividends, etc. in Schedule B and your income and expenses in Schedule C it makes the calculations. You can then import the basic information from the previous year into the current year to help speed you through the process in doing your current tax return."

10252,yes/no,B00GZ2KEJE,Does this training DVD have a section on using layers? I cannot seem to get this!,?,"I, too, struggled with layers. This trainer does go through the same fundamentals you have read in other sources. He than says something like ""keep working at it. Most people eventually grasp layers"". Not good enough for me. I still struggle. I would not recommend this course"
10253,yes/no,B00GZ2KEJE,does it work on a mac,Y,"Yes, however you must be certain that is the MAC Version."
10254,open-ended,B00GZ2KEJE,"How can a Photoshop Elements training DVD, or *any* training DVD be specific to either Windows or Macs?",,"Hi Chaloots! Yeah, I had wondered the same thing; on their website FAQ they state: ""...All of our courses are compatible with both Windows (PC) and Mac computers..."" from the simonsezit dot com faq page. Maybe an Amazon typo, or maybe it refers to Elements 12 not being compatible with Apple Tiger, Leopard, or Snow Leopard, while Elements 12 will work on all versions of Windows XPsp3 and above? Or maybe there's something magical about this particular DVD; after all they said it on the Internet so it must be true! &lt;ggg&gt; Regards, Jim"
10255,yes/no,B00GZ2KEJE,Is there a Mac version available?,?,"Hi James G! According to the simonsezit doc com website FAQ: ""All of our courses are compatible with both Windows (PC) and Mac computers."" Of course Elements 12 will only run on Apple OS Lion and above. (I have the Windows DVD version and it works just fine on Win 8.1). Sorry I don't have a Mac to test it on for ya but if you check out the simonsezit website they might be able to give a definitive answer. Regards, Jim"

10264,yes/no,B00H0374D6,Does it come in a MICRO sd card as shown in the picture?,Y,Yes it does. The data is on a microSD card that fits into a standard SD card adapter. It worked well with my Garmin Nuvi 500.

10271,open-ended,B00H0374D6,How does this differ from Garmin MapSource City Navigator South America NT which has terrible reviews? Is this product better?,,"Garmin doesn't put enough effort in creating maps for south america. They just care about Europe and North America. These are dedicated maps, much better.

10272,open-ended,B00H0374D6,maps come together with gps in the memory card not need to buy anything else and that,,A memory card is the only thing you'll get. The GPS unit is sold separately. It is what it shown in the picture.

10274,yes/no,B00H09BB16,"Ok, so I have a macbook and I'm wondering when i do install it through bootcamp, does that mean all my things on the hard drive will be wiped clean?",N,No. you will have to create a disk partition to install windows on your mac. It will not wipe your Mac OS. Basically part of your HD will be dedicated to windows
10275,yes/no,B00H09BB16,Is this the FULL version?,N,"No. It is not the full retail version, it is for system builders only. It is supposed to be used by computer builders on computers that are sold to someone else, not for themselves. It is not supposed to be transferred to another computer,or, motherboard, even if you destroy the original. That being said,microsoft will let you do a clean install a few times, it gets progressively harder each time. It is ""full"" in the sense that it contains all the same features, it just can not be transferred(installed),unlimited times if you replace the motherboard every 6 months,like I do."
10276,yes/no,B00H09BB16,"can i use this windows 7, to upgrade from a windows 8. I really do not like windows 8 and i need help",?,"I convert all my windows 8 laptops to a std windows 7 display by running classic shell and FSL launcher(google for downloads). you won't be able tell the difference ...looks like, feels like windows seven..but; maybe one day you may want your lap top to act like a tablet..window eight can still be pulled off the side panel...I have loaded a couple of hundred machines like this..no grips..its amazing how many professional people don't like windows 8.....also.. NOTE: guys/gals this is windows 7 Home premium..the max memory you can address is 16gb ....some folks have loaded 32gb and complain of being shorted 16gb."
10277,open-ended,B00H09BB16,How many computers can I load windows 7 home premium oem to?,,"Without digging the License Agreement out of the CD, I'm not positive, but, from what I read about ""oem"" OS software, what you buy is a License to install the OS on ONE, newly created system that, technically, you have built for resale. There's a lot of info out there about whether or not this applies to home builders, or virtual machine builders (using, for e.g., Parallels), but I can tell you that it installed and runs JUST FINE on my Parallels VM. But in the install process, there's a point where you put in your unique ID code that comes with the OS disc and your system communicates online with Microsoft to ""validate"" your key code. I would imagine that they're registering the MAC address and s/n of your system and that after that, your unique validation code won't work on another system. If you ever bought a computer in the day when they came with the OS on a ""reinstallation"" or back-up disc, and then ever tried to install that OS on another computer (or on Parallels....I tried when I first got Parallels), you'll know that it won't work because the install system sees that it's a DIFFERENT machine. I've heard of people sometimes having that problem after repairs of upgrades to their original machine, and there is a phone # where you can call Microsoft and tell them your story and sometimes they'll give you a validation code for an additional install of your changed original machine that came with an oem OS installed. But that's about it I'm afraid. So figure if you buy the oem version, it's for ONE computer."
10278,open-ended,B00H09BB16,So this is for a new computer build? its the full OS because i just built my new comp.,,"Yes it's for a new computer build. Basically, as I understand it, the installer is windows support. With this version you can't call Microsoft for support. That's the only kicker - but if you're building comps chances are that not contacting Microsoft isn't really a big deal."
10279,yes/no,B00H09BB16,Can I use this to upgrade from Vista-64?,?,This isn't an upgrade its actually a full OS. So in other words you will be completely uninstalling vista and re installing windows 7
10280,yes/no,B00H09BB16,Is this eligible for free windows 10 upgrade?,?,"As of today (2-6-15) it is. But Microsoft has been changing their upgrade path plans as they get closer to release. So by time 10 is out, they may have changed the rules on what will be excepted. As of now it's only Windows 7 and 8."
10281,yes/no,B00H09BB16,Will this wipe my PC clean and make it like it came from the factory?,?,"Yes, if that is what you want it to do. And, no if you do not. You have the chose to, format your HDD, hard disk drive, re-install saving your documents, pictures and downloaded files, provided that you currently have Windows 7 installed on your PC. Or, repair the current OS provided it is Win 7 Home Premium. Also, be aware of what bit OS you have if you are upgrading. i.e. 64 bit or 32 bit. You can not down-grade, go from, say Win 8 to Win 7. You must select to format the HDD if your are going from a 32 bit OS to a 64 bit. It is my opinion that Windows 7 Professional 64 bit Operation System is as good as it gets. Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit is sweet, too."
10282,open-ended,B00H09BB16,ive heard that if i use this it'll be bound to the motherboard does that mean i wont be able to upgrade to a different OS later?,,What being bound to the motherboard means that you won't be able to activate it on another PC. If you change the motherboard on your present PC you will have to activate by phone. There will be no problem to upgrade to say windows 8. But then you will have the same issue of that OS bound to the motherboard. I have done this many times with upgrades and PC repairs.
10283,open-ended,B00H09BB16,where is the product key?,,"If you open the white card-stock envelope, you will find your Disc within a blue card-stock envelope. On the front of that blue envelope is a sticker... it has a barcode on the top and right sides of it, and a QR code (square checked UPC type code). To the left of the QR code is your key, along with a tiny Skeleton key symbol. The text is very small, and I had to actually break out my magnifying reading glasses that I use for detail work to read it."
10284,yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,"Is this Microsoft branded? Last time I purchased this, I received a disc from Dell and a License Key clearly peeled off of an old system.",?,"Depends. Amazon is now STUPIDLY listing things under the same titles even though they ship from different sources. Ships from Amazon is likely to be legit. Ships from ANY MARKETPLACE SOURCE IS LIKELY TO BE COUNTERFEIT, RESOLD, COA (not valid), etc. because AMAZON DOES NOT CARE TO POLICE THEIR OWN MARKETPLACE."
10285,open-ended,B00H09BOXQ,"If I install this on one hard drive, can I do a clean install of it later on? On a different hard drive for the same computer?",,"Yes, I'm sure you can. As I understand it, Microsoft maintains a record of your Windows software associated with your computer, not your hard drive. Your clean install at a later time will require deleting the original install if both drives are present at the time. In a worse case scenario, you might have to call Microsoft customer support if you have a glitch; just explain to them what you are trying to do and they will get you through it."
10286,yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,Are there any installation instructions?,N,"No, but there are a lot of online tutorials. Check this one out http://www.techtalkz.com/windows-7/514412-windows-7-installation-guide-tutorial.html"
10287,yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,Can I load this on a virtual machine like VMware Fusion?,?,I loaded this on my Mac mini running fusion. I also have an xp pro and s Ubuntu partition. Very easy install and runs great.
10288,open-ended,B00H09BOXQ,Doe's Windows Pro support 32GB of ram?,,"Yes. Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate support up to 192GB of ram. Home Premium onlys allow 16GB max. After that, it now all depends on how much memory your processor and motherboard can support."
10289,yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,Will this version of Windows 7 receive Microsoft updates via Windows Update program after activation?,Y,"Yes, it does. This is a normal Microsoft copy of windows. I've bought numerous copies for my builds."
10290,yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,Is this the version I need? I have a HP pavilion DV6 (originally had windows 7) that got killed by malware.,Y,Yes
10291,yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,Can I install this Windows 7 Pro on more than 3 Pcs ?,?,"The OEM (system builder) edition allows for one installation only activated by Microsoft. Installing the OEM on multiple computers will cause the authentication process to fail and you'll have an unlicensed version of windows on 4 of your 5 computers! If you need to install windows 7 pro on more, you need to purchase the retail version of windows, which will allow you to install the same license key onto up to 5 machines."
10292,yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,I'm replacing the 32 bit version. Can I install this without having to reinstall existing files and programs?,?,"Basically, any new operating system installs best on a newly formatted HD. This means your computer's empty. You are not going to save your programs and data. Be aware most programs will need to be reinstalled, then it's data can be restored. This being said, your computer should forget who it was and it's component parts also, part of a OEM disk protocol is to format your HD. Be sure to have access to your computer's manufactures web sit for driver access. Win 7 Pro has a good driver data base but may not have your network card or wireless radio. Having an Ethernet dongle is recommended. This is if you have an OEM OS disk, an update disk is different. Not as clean of a reinstall of the OS, I've heard."
10293,yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,does it contain powerpoint,?,No. PowerPoint is typically an inherent part of the Microsoft Office. As such you will have to purchase MS Office and install it separately.
10294,yes/no,B00H09BO2M,Will Windows 7 monthly updates be available with this product?,Y,Yes
10295,yes/no,B00H09BO2M,can this be used to go from win xp to win 7?,?,"Actually Yes. First install Windows Easy Transfer for XP and export all your settings to and external drive or network share. After Windows 7 installation run Easy Transfer (already in Win7) and restore your settings. This will transfer all your internet settings, favorites, docs, music, pics, etc., but not any of your old programs. Be sure to have copies of programs that you want to re-install after the of Windows 7."
10296,open-ended,B00H09BO2M,How many Systems can you install onto?,,One system
10297,open-ended,B00H09BO2M,"Do you get a disc and activation code, or just the activation code and then you download Windows 7?",,I received a disk.
10298,open-ended,B00H09BO2M,"I purchased the 32 bit version of Win7 Pro. Now I need 64 bit version for same computer. Can I use this disc again, or do i need new 64 bit disc?",,No. You will need a 64 bit version with the proper DVD. Note the retail version shipped with 2 DVD's... one for each verdion.
10299,open-ended,B00H09BO2M,Can this be used to install Windows 7 Pro via a Virtual Machine setup eg VirtualBox or VMWare?,,"According to this article, you don't need a copy of Windows to run a VirtualBox copy of Windows (http://pclosmag.com/html/issues/201309/page15.html)...good luck!"
10300,open-ended,B00H09BO2M,how do I solve a dll problem?,,"I would need much more information and specific error messages. If you have a 2nd computer nearby, you can search for solutions to problems you encounter."
10301,yes/no,B00H09BO2M,Does this come with a COA sticker you can place on the computer you are using it on?,?,"Mine did. I haven't installed it yet, however. I'm hoping everything validates, OK with Microsoft."
10302,yes/no,B00H09BO2M,will this work with VirtualBox?,Y,Yes
10303,open-ended,B00H09BO2M,"I have a used PC with Win7 already installed, it needs a clean install as it's severely infected, will this work? Does it come with a License Key?",,"Most reviewers (myself included) state that they received both the disk and the COA (has the activation key on it). And yes, this can and will do a clean install. Be sure you have your data backed up. ""Looking for your product key? The product key is a 25-digit string with a hyphen between each 5 digits. It will say ""Product Key"" before 25 digits or have an image of a key next to 10 digits with the remaining 15 on the next line below. The Product Key is generally located in the lower left corner of the DVD case, on the disc itself, or on a leaflet in the packaging you received."""

This is something that works well, and is a feature that they have had for a long time, so it's not buggy. I have read there are occasionally mapping issues between programs (maybe something like military service is mapped to different fields in the two programs), but I have not experienced it."

10317,open-ended,B00H8JLILG,Is it necessary to maintain the Ancestry.com membership? Once I have synched the data will it work as a standalone without a membership?,,"I found that I could use it as just a format. Yes, at least for me it was stand alone. It's just that if you are missing data you have to search it on your own and then add it manually. I needed a lot of missing data and so I'm at a stand still on what I will do next as it seems that Ancestry.com had very little to offer me and kept offering sites that required more fees. Other than that the software was pretty straight forward as long as you read the instructions. Good luck and hope this help."

From what I've read, malwarebytes is used to clean up the leftovers (registry entries and leftover files) after you manually clean off the major bits (such as the program or programs that installed dosearches to begin with).

This guide should show you how to remove it. http://www.techsupportall.com/how-to-remove-dosearch-com-from-internet-explorer-chrome-firefox/"

By the time we figured this out it was to late for a refund, Our tech support recommended Family Tree Maker which is what I have had on my Computer for years. So bottom line, this is not a program I would recommend Family Tree Maker is what I installed on my fathers computer it installed easily and works great."

10384,yes/no,B00HM3QP5W,Is there any benefit/detriment to purchasing the download and not purchasing the CD/Rom,?,"None really, I've had both and never found any real pros or cons, to each his on I guess. The download can be re-issued without cost in the event of loss of data (don't let anyone tell you otherwise) so the only real benefit of the CD is an actual hard copy. But saying that the program itself is tiny so, a disk copy has always been overkill to me. I keep a mobile version on my USB at all times, so a hard copy gives me nothing."
10385,open-ended,B00HM3QP5W,"Do you need to use the CD every time, or can you upload the program into your computer, like Office?",,"No, once load it the first time, I only have to press the shortcut icon to get it back later.

10386,yes/no,B00HM3QP5W,Can i download and run final draft 9 from flash memory?,?,"If that flash drive remains on the same computer it will work fine. If you are looking to run the software on multiple computers from the drive it may be possible on Macs, but not on Windows because the entries that must be made to the registry won't be on any computer other than the one where the software was first installed. Either way, moving this software from computer to computer may very well violate the EULA. I wouldn't suggest doing that."

Yes, we removed Collabowriter from this version. We had to remove it because anti-virus software and firewalls were limiting connections to the feature. We are in the process of reviewing Collaboration methods and ways to bring this feature back into Final Draft 9. In the meantime, our users are reporting to us that they successfully employ a number of free screen sharing options out there right now (Mac OSX, Screen Hero, Join.me, Skype) which allow them work in Final Draft together now. We have not determined if this is something we'll include in version 9 or future release."
10388,yes/no,B00HM3QP5W,I'm looking to start using a screenplay writing program as opposed to just a Microsoft Word for writing my screenplays. Is this program worth the buy?,Y,"Hi, thanks for the question, Final Draft 8 in my opinion really a must, I don't mean for status or bragging rights (what with everyone who is everyone using it) but for the sheer brilliance of it all. The biggest problem with screenwriting is the formatting, FD looks after that without you even noticing, they even change if if the industry standard changes by updating. I resisted buying for years, I used Word, Celtx etc, but you kick it up a notch as soon as you get FD. And the scene card view can really help with blocking or plotting issues. The program can help with analyticals too, swearing counts, and will even let you know if Uncle Bob's character hasn't had a line in a while :) Check out the online manuals, they explain most of the functions. Version 9 is still very buggy, avoid it for now if you can. If you (like me) plot and plan obsessively another tool I use every day is a tiny piece of software called 'writer's cafe'. It has everything a writer needs for the planning process, the bookshelf and post-it note pegboard for scene plotting is awesome. Please let me know if you need anything else. P"

If you have an iPad go with the Mac version because then you can download Final Draft writer app ($25) and can go back and forth.
10393,open-ended,B00HM3QP5W,Final Draft 9 or Movie Magic Screenwriter Version 6?

10413,yes/no,B00HNYDTE0,"Will I be allowed to download the software to more than one computer (i.e., my laptop and back-up hard drive)?",Y,"Yes. After installation, the software requires authentication (activation) of the license with the publisher. The license you purchase specifies the number of authenticated (activated) copies.

However, the User's manual is under the ""Help"" tab and you can also find some free video tutorials on YouTube and there are a couple of books you can purchase. From my experience, the program is pretty intuitive and a little bit of fiddling around with it and watching the YouTube videos should get you enough of a foundation that you won't need a tutorial and should only need the user's manual for specific tasks. Hope this helps. Good Luck!"
10417,open-ended,B00HNYDTE0,What output formats are available? .DOC? .PDF? .RTF?,,All of the above. 10 export file options.

10423,yes/no,B00HNYDTE0,"Will I be allowed to download the software to more than one computer (i.e., my laptop and back-up hard drive)?",Y,"Yes. After installation, the software requires authentication (activation) of the license with the publisher. The license you purchase specifies the number of authenticated (activated) copies. I believe each license can have two authenticated (activated) installations. For example, I have two licenses, purchased on line from Amazon, with two authentications (activations) each, for a total of four copies in use."
10424,open-ended,B00HNYDTE0,Do you know if FD9 supports other languages like spanish? Is that included or an additional purchase is required?,,"I bought Final Draft 9 as a download through Amazon. I feel 99% certain that it was available in multiple languages, and you choose which language at the time of download. I also think it offers spell checker in those languages also."
10425,yes/no,B00HNYDTE0,Is Final Draft 9 compatible with Final Draft 8?,Y,yes
10426,open-ended,B00HNYDTE0,Is there a tutorial in the program? Where is it?,,"Sorry, there isn't a tutorial program that I can find. However, the User's manual is under the ""Help"" tab and you can also find some free video tutorials on YouTube and there are a couple of books you can purchase. From my experience, the program is pretty intuitive and a little bit of fiddling around with it and watching the YouTube videos should get you enough of a foundation that you won't need a tutorial and should only need the user's manual for specific tasks. Hope this helps. Good Luck!"
10427,open-ended,B00HNYDTE0,What output formats are available? .DOC? .PDF? .RTF?,,All of the above. 10 export file options.
10428,open-ended,B00HNYDTE0,"I just purchased FD download. If FD 10 comes out soon, will I get a free upgrade since I just bought this? &amp; if windows 10 comes out, will FD 9 work?",,No
10429,yes/no,B00HRQB28Y,"Does the software have a ""frame graber"" that allows the capture of a fame and saving it as a JPEG?",?,"This software allows to take a Snapshot to the File of the frame, and save it as an image file (.jpg or .png). Although there is no Frame Grabber per say. Here is the instruction for this: Right-click the display and choose Save Snapshot to File to save the current frame as an image file. The Save Snapshot to File dialog is displayed to allow you to choose the format and location where you want to save the file. The file is automatically added to the Project Media window. Hopefully it helps. Best wishes, MP"
10430,yes/no,B00HRQB28Y,"Does this program contain a green screen project and if yes, can you use movies on a green screen. Thank you",Y,"Yes. There is a croma keyer and other green screen effects you can do. Vary simple to use. I would look it up on the YouTube's to see it in action, but yeah, its pretty straight forward to use. :) PS I use it all the time in my videos"
10431,yes/no,B00HRQB28Y,Does this convert between differnt video formats,N,"From Sony's site: Import - AAC, AA3, AIFF, AVI, BMP, CDA, FLAC, GIF, JPEG, MP3, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MVC, OGG, OMA, PCA, PNG, QuickTime, SND, SFA, W64, WAV, WDP, WMA, WMV, XAVC S Export - AAC, AC3, AA3, AIFF, AVC, AVI, BMP, FLAC, JPEG, LPEC, MP3, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MVC, OGG, PCA, PNG, TIFF, QuickTime, W64, WAV, WDP, WMA, WMV, XAVC S. Note that this is not meant to be a format converter - there will be some loss importing in one format and exporting in another. For just converting from one format to another there are a lot of good freeware programs out there. And for some strange reason Sony Movie Studio 13 still refuses to support FLV format. ???"
10432,yes/no,B00HRQB28Y,Can I install this on both my desktop and laptop with a single purchase (like photoshop and some other softwares allow)? I have Vegas 9 on my desktop and would like to upgrade that at the same time I install something on this laptop. Thanks for any...,?,Most licenses do allow you to load on the desktop and laptop at the same time. Since you can't use both at the same time you're still using the single license. As for installing it appears to work fine.
10433,yes/no,B00HRQB28Y,Does it have a video capture mode to allow importing from videotape?,?,"Not that I have found. I still have an old copy of the Pinnacle software that came with an analog to digital converter that I use for this; I am quite sure this Sony Suite 13 does not have that function. If I get proven wrong, please let me know."
10434,open-ended,B00HRQB28Y,"Does the software have a ""frame graber"" that allows the capture of a fame and saving it as a JPEG? Also, does the SW come with a paper printed manual?",,"Re frame grabber: I haven't seen a paper manual or even a downloadable pdf manual. I bought the download version, rather than the boxed version. However, it has pretty good helpfiles, and there are a number of very useful videos on YouTube. Mostly I'm working with building a narration with a music background, for which I use the Acid Music Studio that comes with the package. When I'm done, I will load the narrative-music audio file into Sony video studio and complete the movie. As for a frame grabber, there is a frame grabber that copies a frame from the preview window and allows you to save it. I've never used it, but I'm sure it will work. If I want to grab a frame from the internet, I use the shift Shift Print Screen function in Windows, then paste the frame into Photoshop or other digital editor and crop out all the garbage. That works great. Hope this helps. C.B. Hampton"
10435,open-ended,B00HRQB28Y,Can I burn a DVD out of the movie studio section or does it make you re-render again in DVD Architect? I heard this is possible now in later versions.,,"Yes, I never used it because I just make YouTube video, but is the option is there :) I thank you can do blue ray to but I'll have to get back to you on that."
10436,yes/no,B00HRQB28Y,Does the software has a feather to make menu and sub-menus. Thank you,N,"Your question uses the word ""feather"", which I am assuming is a typo and you meant to use the word ""feature"". I am not aware of it, however, it probably does, as it has everything else. The problem with Sony Movie studio is that it has all these features but no way to know they exist, let alone use them. Why doesn't Sony Movie Studio access mkv (Matroska) containers? The data within is the same as with mp4 container (H264 codex), but Sony Movie Studio won't access it. Is it because Matoska is open source? As a linear editor, it should. My biggest objection to Sony Movie Studio is their ""Help"" file. The help file is something like 4 versions behind, and they must have hired the guy from Microsoft to write it because it is just chocked full of accurate tidbits of accurate information that are completely useless. I would suggest that Sony hire someone from the teaching biz to write the help file, instead of some software weenie. You can ask a dozen questions like the one you just proffered, but unless I spend hours upon hours hunting and pecking my way thru the myriad of buttons, knobs, dials, sliders, etc. to find out how it actually works (because the Help file doesn't explain anything) my answer will most likely be: who the *&%^ knows? Imagine it this way: you get into an automobile for the first time and you ask me, ""How do I drive to Poughkeepsie?"" and I reply, ""Just turn the key and stay in your lane."" How far do you think you're going to get?"
10437,open-ended,B00HRQB28Y,"For those of you who own this software, how do you enjoy working with it? Any Pro and Con's? Would you recommend this software to beginners?",,"I don't know what kind of background you have regarding video editing software; if you're a beginner, Sony Movie Studio has a simplified mode (Which is already way more advanced and significantly more complicated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on the iPhone) ~ this should be sufficient for many editing needs such as putting in title cards, inserting transitions, managing different video clips/audio tracks/still images, etc. I found that Sony Movie Studio is more versatile than Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus since it comprises of multiple independent software packages that are more comprehensive in breadth and depth. Pinnacle Studio is entirely usable and the main application is easier to install/get started with but I personally prefer Movie Studio since I was disappointed with the sound-editing functions in Pinnacle. For really simple videos eg. stringing some still photos, title cards, and video snippets together, I found Pinnacle to be a little bit more intuitive. Source: I own Pinnacle Studio 17 and Sony Movie Studio 13"
10438,open-ended,B00HRQB28Y,I see it says you can upload straight to Facebook. I want to know can you upload straight to YouTube?,,"Yes, you can there is the option for either youtube of facebook. I am sorry my previous answer said you could not and I was wrong yesterday. I just was editing a video and realized this. I usually tag all ov my videos before I upload them for extra seo purposes."
10439,yes/no,B00HRQB216,Can you create green screen projects with this software?,Y,"Oh yes. All versions of Sony Movie Studio since 9 have a pretty decent chroma key effect. I've been using it a lot. You can use any color, doesn't have to be green. Just make sure you have good, consistent lighting."
10440,yes/no,B00HRQB216,is vista compatible ?,N,"Unfortunoutly no, its not"
10441,yes/no,B00HRQB216,Can you key out a green screen?,Y,"Yes, It has Chroma Key layer, which you can use for green screens."
10442,yes/no,B00HRQB216,"Ok, so all i really need is a software i can use to transfer videos from my phone/cannon camera to DVD disc, will this work for me?",Y,"It would be a bit overkill. If it is just transfers to pc then to burn to DVD, Windows can already do that for free. If you wanted to take all that and create a video from it all or presentation then yes."
10443,yes/no,B00HRQB216,Can you add narration to a video you create with Sony Movie Studio 13?,Y,Yes! We used an inexpensive headset with a microphone that plugged into the computer (USB connection)..My son did voice overs and was able to add background music.
10444,open-ended,B00HRQB216,Can this render to 720p or 1080p with AAC audio at 320 CBR or VBR?,,"Of course. However I cannot find AAC with VBR. If there are settings for that somewhere, there are hidden. There is AAC with CBR of course, all bitrates up to 512 kbps, at standard 48000hz."
10445,open-ended,B00HRQB216,Can this render to AAC audio at 320 CBR or VBR and 720p or 1080p video?,,This is a little over my head but tried to find this out for you. There are long lists of possible render modes I do see on the list `Main Concept AVC/AAC' I also see `Fraunhofer AAC' I tried to include a screen shot of the Templates list for each when they are highlighted - but I guess this medium of interaction does not allow these. I dont' think the `Fraunhofer AAC' thing is anything you are looking for but there is a long list of items under the templates side when `Main Concept AVC/AAC' is highlighted - I don't have the time to copy by hand the whole list - if you could send me an e-mail directly I could screen shot you the list. But it seems like the list likely contains the parameters/features you were looking for. you may write me directly if this amazon sites allows it. david.blake@unitypoint.org Dave
10446,yes/no,B00HRQB216,"If I buy the physical CD version from seller Amazon, do I get the box, manual, DVD creater software, etc?",?,"You should get the box, but if I were u I'd get the down load version, never lose your cd or cd key that way"
10447,open-ended,B00HRQB216,Why can't I render my videos using an AMD graphics card? I know its not the best card but it will be way faster than my CPU.,,"They only program for certain types of cards. I bought a new Nvida card and it would not work. But we had an older Nvida card and it worked. Also, there are two video card options. One of them is CUDA and I cannot remember the other. Make sure you try them both. Check their forums for more information. My older Nvida card made rendering much faster."
10448,yes/no,B00HRQB216,Can you create a video with a transparent background? Thanks.,?,"I don't know for sure buddy, sorry. But this is a really simple program to do basic stuffs, I was used to use Vegas Pro and became a little bit disappointed with this one."
10449,yes/no,B00HUUBNT0,"Can you prepare 2 separate wills, such as one each for husband &amp; wife?",Y,"Yes. The program allows you to select the state you live in so the laws are applicable, and you can save data for each individual person and create wills for as many people as you desire"
10450,yes/no,B00HUUBNT0,"The Willmaker Plus shows various forms other than the will (example; power of attorney, personal loan docs, etc). Does the Premium version have these?",Y,"Yes, and more. Medical wishes, medical legal forms, funeral arrangements, etc.. It even comes with an inventory set of forms which are printable (as are all forms) to aid you in what personal items to leave to others."
10451,yes/no,B00HUUBNT0,will your willmaker download to a mac?,?,"Unfortunately, this product only runs on Windows. If you have VMWare or Parallels, you can run a Windows virtual machine on your Mac and install this in the virtual machine."
10452,open-ended,B00HUUBNT0,Can you prepare a living trust for different people or are you only allowed one living trust?,,more than one
10453,yes/no,B00HUUBNT0,Do I need Word on my computer to use this?,?,"You print the document from the program, no need for Word. Use a parchment paper and it really looks good."
10454,yes/no,B00HUUBNT0,Does it matter which state you live in? I thought every state had its separate conditions.,?,"The program asks you which state you live in to determine laws, statutes, individual regulations that are state specific."
10455,yes/no,B00HUUBNT0,Does the Home and Family version include the Promissory Note documents like the Plus version?,?,Promissory Note (Balloon Payment) Promissory Note (Installment Payments) Promissory Note (One Lump-Sum Payment) Promissory Note (Payments of Interest Only)
10456,yes/no,B00HUUBNT0,Does the Living Trust software work as stand alone software? I do not want my info online as required by the 2015 product.,N,No
10457,open-ended,B00HUUBNT0,Can anyone tell me if there is the option to create an AB trust?,,"No, not specifically in the Family Plus version. Looks like the AB option is complicated and that you'll need to purchase the Living Trust maker to create any Trust. I happened to be working in this program as your question came in, and copied this info for you: ""Keep in mind that AB trusts limit the surviving spouse's ability to use trust property, can be expensive to create, and in some situations can cause stress among family members. So, if you think that an AB trust might be useful for you, do some more research on your own or discuss your options with an experienced estate planning attorney. To learn more about AB trusts, visit the Wills, Trusts & Probate section at nolo.com or read Make Your Own Living Trust, by Denis Clifford (Nolo)."""
10458,open-ended,B00HUUBNT0,Can the documents be changed in Living Trusts or is it just fill in the blank?,,"Great Question! As most Quicken products, Will Maker offers an interview format for easy creation of legal documents w/o having to change any legalities. That being said, you can, however, change the margins, font and document spacing within the program itself. And, you can export the completed document as a text file into Word or other word processing program and make any changes you deem fit. So yes, one can change the forms but only using an outside text program."
10459,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,Does this program export the final product to Word?,?,"Quicken WillMaker creates the final document as an Adobe .pdf file. However, once that file is made, you can open your final document in WillMaker, and then export the file as a .rtf file in MS Word, or Open Office Word. Once in the MS Word format, the contents may be edited as necessary and saved as a MS Word .doc or .docx file."
10460,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,Can I run this software on more than 1 computer?,?,Yea
10461,open-ended,B00HV03LA8,are you able to use this for husband and wife? or is it only for one person?,,"Yes, my wife and I made separate wills with this program."
10462,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,I need to create 3 sets of docs. I assume that this software will allow that if the files are saved in different names. Is my assumption correct?,?,"The will documents allow you to save in different names, the online trust can only be used once."
10463,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,"With Willmaker, if our divorced daughter dies before we do, can her inheritance from us for the grandchild b controlled by one of our other children",?,"These are ""see a lawyer"" questions and beyond the simple scope of this program."
10464,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,Will this software run on a windows 64 bit operating system?,Y,"I loaded this program on window 7 pro 64. It is placed under ""program files (x86)"" and runs great."
10465,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,Does this software have a Right of Survivorship form for real estate property?,Y,"Yes in several fashion. Via power of attorney financial, wills and living trusts"
10466,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,Does this software include prenuptial documents?,?,"No. Just the will, general power of atty and health care proxy."
10467,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,Will this work on an iMAC?,?,"Nolo, the company that sells WillMaker, says on their website that it is not Mac compatible and they suggest you use the on-line version if you have a Mac."
10468,yes/no,B00HV03LA8,Is there a trick to copy and paste into the WIllmaker Plus forms? A real pain to have to retype addresses one letter at a time.,?,EDIT
10469,yes/no,B00HX0TSSA,Do you have to uninstall 2013 norton to install the norton 2014 version,?,"No it should do what is necessary as in actuality its on upgrade. Only if you are using a completely different product, say AVG and now using Norton, then you would have to uninstall the AVG."
10470,yes/no,B00HX0TSSA,My Norton's 360 will expire in 4 days. Can I download a new one from Amazon to replace my current Norton's?,Y,"Yes you can,trust amazon they will do you right !"
10471,yes/no,B00HX0TSSA,Does Norton 360 have automatic updates with it?,Y,"Yes, it includes LiveUpdate. It always have your application updated to the last release."
10472,yes/no,B00HX0TSSA,I plan to purchase a new pc with 8.1. Will I be able to use this?,?,"You certainly can. I am currently using the 3 license version, and have not had a problem. I have used Norton products for over 20 years rather than some other well known brands. Besides, some of the other brands will bug the C%$# out of you."
10473,open-ended,B00HX0TSSA,"Is one better than the other, to have a disk and download, or the online download.",,"to me it seems better and easier for me to have the disk rather than try to download, when I try to download one I usually have trouble. if I have the disk I can always go back to it."
10474,open-ended,B00HX0TSSA,How much does it slow up your computer when running a scan and when not running a scan?,,Scans are automatically set to run when you are not on the computer at night. You can manually set them for whenever you want and click a scan button for any time. It does extremely slow it down and that is why you would want it to run when you are asleep.
10475,yes/no,B00HX0TSSA,Does it protect you from malware?,?,"Yes. It does protect against malware, but no security software is 100% full-proof as there are many viruses being released every day. The most important thing is to make sure your Norton, Windows and other programs are up-to-date. I know it is annoying to update them, but it will be even more frustrating if you don't update them, get a virus that disables your computer(has happened to me before) or hacks into your computer and steals your information. So stay on top of it. Don't download links from emails if you are not sure. I have been using Norton for about 12 years without any problem."
10476,yes/no,B00HX0TSSA,"If you buy one license &amp; your computer dies, causing you to buy a new computer, are you out of luck because you didn't get the 3 licenses?",?,i think you should be able to call them & have your norton transferred to the new one.

Do i need to uninstall my old norton and download?,N,"NOT 100% sure if YOU should however, in 2013 I eventually ended up doing that in order for the renewal download to install. In 2014 I ordered the DVD instead of a download. I did not delete the 2013 downloaded version when I installed from the DVD - and now wonder if I should have as there are some problems. Minor & irritating for most part - possibly correctable if I had the patience. Sorry that I am unable to give your a more simple direct answer."
10478,yes/no,B00HX0TSSA,I had norton internet security installed in my computer. Can I still install the Norton 360 and speed up my computer?,N,The NIS may not be the reason your computer is running slow. 360 has extra features like cloud backup for added data safety and PC tune up which may or may not solve your problem. I am sure you can purchase the 360 and add the time from the NIS to your account but possibly not. All you can do is ask a Symantec technician.
10479,yes/no,B00HX0TSSA,Do you have to uninstall 2013 norton to install the norton 2014 version,?,"No it should do what is necessary as in actuality its on upgrade. Only if you are using a completely different product, say AVG and now using Norton, then you would have to uninstall the AVG."

10490,open-ended,B00ICPW2HO,Is the software download limited to once only one hardware? I have 2 desktop and 2 laptop in my house alone.Or can I creat a backup disc .,,It's software that you own and can download onto all of your computers. All you have to do is access your account on amazon and download as many times as you want as long as it is onto your computers for your own personal use.
10491,open-ended,B00ICPW2HO,"Does this download include only the applicable software? In other words, there are no additional programs to get into my hard drive? Thanks.",,"Oh, no. There are no piggybacks. I would like to take this opportunity to assure you that there are check boxes that you need to be careful for when installing or updating. I can't tell you the times that I had to retry an update because there were three things being installed instead of just the one. I had two boxes to uncheck. I wish I could know what file extensions you were converting. I only used this to convert from one type and could find no use after that."
10492,yes/no,B00ICPW2HO,Will this software join &amp; convert multiple VOB files to a single MP4 Mpeg format for Youtube DVD etc.........,?,"I can't say. My problem was the program did not work, with my computer OS (Windows 7). I was attempting to convert mp4(s) files to mp3 files. The downloaded program could not ""see"" the files in the folder. The download provider did try to correct the problem but after two attempts with no change in the program's ability to acquire the files, I felt I had been patient enough. They company representing the download called and asked for permission to control my computer, so that they might be able to fix the problem. I did not feel comfortable allowing someone that I did not know that kind of access to my computer."
10493,yes/no,B00ICPW2HO,Does this software work with HD files like AVCHD to MP4 and back again?,Y,"I think so. I happen to have a Canon Rebel XTI as well as a Canon HD video camera. (AVCHD) I am going to be using it for just that purpose, If Amazon can keep this string live I will answer in the next few days. I am very impressed thus far with Stellar's product. Worth having in any event."
10494,yes/no,B00ICPW2HO,"Can this program convert many WMA files to MP3 at the same time, as in batch processing?",?,I have not used it recently but it can due allot at a time it did put them in a different order but this could have been my computer ignorance

10496,open-ended,B00ICPW2HO,I bought amazon music and I want to put it on Windows Movie Maker 2.6 Can I use this software for this? if not where can I go to do this?,,Yea convert the audio into mp3 file
10497,open-ended,B00ICPW2HO,"Hi, I like to know if I could use this software to convert youtube videos using url link into mp3? thanks.",,"You could use an online service such as http://www.clipconverter.cc/ to link, download and convert the you tube video in one simple step. Just copy and paste the link or the URL and the program automatically downloads and converts the file into mp3 for you. There might be some problems for a few videos. For example, some convertors don't allow the download and conversion of large files such as full albums or long songs. You would need to check the specifics of the program to make sure ttha you can download and convert large files. Also you must find a program that converts you tube videos (.flv) to mp3."
10498,yes/no,B00ICPW2HO,Can this product create an MP3 file from a Youtube URL?,?,Left handed response: any file on your computer can be converted. I make MP3 from YouTube by recording from one computer to Audacity on another computer. No quality is lost. I suppose the Sound Recorder can do this. With Stellar I have only converted one format. That was the only reason I got it. Now I have no use for Stellar. Bruce Winning

Having said that, yes, you can also import it Video Studio. First you will need to save the movie file on Movie Maker as a "".wmv"" file (not as a project), then drag/insert into the Video Studio program timeline.

10554,open-ended,B00INB1GEM,Will this convert VOB format to MP3 or MP4?,,Yes. When you insert a DVD it should pick it up.
10555,open-ended,B00INB1GEM,How does this program work with subtitles and closed caption?,,The version I have gives you the option of selecting check boxes for closed caption and subtitles. But..only if the DVD has it built in already. Its a good program but it still is a little buggy. If you convert your personal DVD to iPad format the audio and movie sometimes are out in Sync. Sometimes by allot. Its hit or miss. Careful when upgrading versions...they will make you purchase the program again. They will try to trick you so be cautious.

I've not been able to get Dragon Dictate v.4 to work satisfactorily with 10.9.4 Mavericks on a late model MacBook Pro Retina with 16GB of RAM. One thing that I did insist on when upgrading through Nuance on was to get in writing from them that I had a 30-day unconditional return privilege. Normally vendors won't give refunds on software. If you can get a trial copy then at least you'll know what you'll get in terms of performance and accuracy with 2GB without having to buy a product.My experience has been that this app is erratic and buggy and, unbelievably they've not updated it to take care of the major problems. A few users claim to get satisfactory results with the Mac version. Not in my case. An option would be to contact OtherWorldComputing (MacSales) to ask what the cost would be to upgrade to 4 or 8 GB and how much of a performance boost could be expected. They provide easy to follow DIY videos and instructions for specific MacBook Pro models on how to insert the memory. Depending on the model, only a screwdriver and/or some knowledge about preventing static electricity from damaging sensitive components. The videos can be viewed at their site to give you an idea whether it's something you'd want to tackle."
10558,open-ended,B00IP93PV4,"For those who dislike Dragon Dictate, what are the alternatives?",,There really are no alternatives... There is a don't program into the operating system but it's not very user-friendly

10560,open-ended,B00IP93PV4,What's the difference between this version and the wireless version? Just the headset?,,"I haven't bought the wireless version but I'm certain its the same software, the only difference is the bluetooth headset. I don't know how much value the headset adds because I've always used my own microphones."
10561,open-ended,B00IP93PV4,Does anyone one know if it works with Mac Yosmite 10.10 operating system?,,"Yes, I use Mac Yosmite and Dragon Dictate works fine at times. At other times its temperamental. It crashes and re-launches a few seconds later. Thankfully you don't lose much work. overall, its manageable but takes a few seconds extra. I have not been able to work this out though!"
10562,yes/no,B00IP93PV4,Does this work for OS X Yosemite?,Y,Yes
10563,yes/no,B00IP93PV4,Is Dragon Dictate compatable with the iAuthor app?,Y,I haven't used that one. It does type in any window I've used it in. But getting complicated with it is a lot easier in a text window than something like Pages with a lot of commands.
10564,yes/no,B00IP93PV4,can you use this with MS Office for MAC,Y,"Yes! You can use this program for any application in which you type. I use it primarily in MS office but also in email, chat windows, etc."
10565,open-ended,B00IP93PV4,"Is Dragon Dictate compatible with LibreOffice or OpenOffice? I've had no end of trouble trying to use Enhanced Dictation, especially with these.",,Sorry I use with Microsoft office on my desktop and laptop and it works great I also use the free version with pages on my iPad and iPhone and it works great I would call Nuance direct I fpubd then very helpful good luck
10566,yes/no,B00IVFDZBC,Is it ok for apple mac computer for fashion design?,?,CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X7 only runs under Windows 7 or 8. So to run it on a Mac you will need to run Windows on your Mac.
10567,yes/no,B00IVFDZBC,Is this software good for t shirt design?,?,"Perfect! If you have not used Corel Draw before, there is a ""learning curve"". If you have used Adobe Illustrator, using Corel Draw should present no problem."
10568,yes/no,B00IVFDZBC,Corel WordPerfect easily converts to Word for non-Corel users. Does the Graphics Suite also convert so that Adobe users can work with my files?,?,"Yes. CDGS can save files in .ai , .eps, . pdf and .psd formats. However, with all such conversions there is always a chance that some aspects of your file may not be included if identical features do not exist between applications (e.g. Photo-paint does not have layer styles so no layer styles are included in an exported psd file and vice versa when importing and exporting psd files)."
10569,open-ended,B00IVFDZBC,Is this a 1-year subscription or a perpetual license?,,"Corel still offers a perpetual license, they haven't gone to a subscription basis."
10570,yes/no,B00IVFDZBC,May I upload this sotware both on laptop and pc?,Y,I have a PC with Windows 7 Premium and can only speak for a PC. But the software installed without a hitch. It will install on Windows 8. However it is a big program and you need 2GB RAM and 1GB space on your hard drive.
10571,yes/no,B00IVFDZBC,Is this a FULL complete version software?,Y,Yes..
10572,yes/no,B00IVFDZBC,Is this compatible with US Cutters machines?,Y,"Yes, it is."

10575,yes/no,B00IVFDZBC,Is this Original Product...which has unique and valid licence?????,Y,"Not quite sure what you mean by this. However, if you are asking if it is genuine YOURS solely when you purchase AND it has a unique licence number in the box, then the answer is yes to all. It is utterly excellent and comes with my very highest recommendation. I've been using previous versions of the software for years, but this is definitly a major step forward. Not cheap, but worth every penny."
10576,open-ended,B00J04F9LW,because this is free does it come with pop up advertising constantly?,,"Yes it does, but you can block pop ups in your internet settings."
10577,open-ended,B00J04F9LW,Does this have a firewall or IP protection?,,"yes it does and works very well as an internet security, if you have tried Norton then this is as good as Norton."
10578,yes/no,B00J04F9LW,"Is the Amazon ""Games andSoftware Downloader"" compatible with Windows 8?

10580,yes/no,B00J04F9LW,are there hidden costs?,?,None that I have experienced.
10581,open-ended,B00J04F9LW,Since this is free does it come with a bunch of pop up advertisments?,,"No, no Ads - it just gathers certain... ""statistics"" about certain data on your PC and sends it to certain company in China. That way the developer can afford paying Softwin for their ""Bitdefender"" antivirus engine (which is embedded into this product) and for other expenses ;-)"
10582,open-ended,B00JC5Y6WM,"Opens and then able to edit Powerpoint 2007, 2010, and 2013?",,I have not had any issues opening and editing Powerpoint 2013 with Presentations X7
10583,open-ended,B00JC5Y6WM,How many computers can you download it to?,,One per computer
10584,open-ended,B00JC5Y6WM,How useful are the pdf tools? Will WP Office X7 convert a pdf Image Only file containing text to a WP text file?,,"Yes. The Open PDF function brings up an initial dialog that allows you to choose between converting only the text from the file or also converting the text in images contained in the file.The fidelity of the conversion depends upon image quality and fonts to some extent, but this is true of any scanned image. I have converted downloaded PDF mathematical papers producing legible text with relatively few errors that can often be picked up with the spell checker. In some cases, more difficult formatting may have to be repaired. My only irritation is that the formatting process uses a lot of styles. All and all, the PDF import is a good tool for repurposing text from the original PDF. PDF documents from WP are normally high quality. You have options for the quality ranging from Commerical Printing, PDF/A level A or level B compliance, and Publishing online. These produce different file sizes. Incidentally, WP uses the OEM Omnipage OCR engine to drive its conversion."
10585,open-ended,B00JC5Y6WM,How does this version differ from WordPerfect Office X6? Are there enough improvements to warrant upgrading from X6?,,"Whether or not an upgrade is worthwhile depends greatly upon your document requirements. X7 is the first version of WP to allow more than 9 documents to be open at once. I have opened as many as 18 documents without problem. The ebook publisher now does Epub format in addition to mobi. X7 also enhances the ability to publish a WP document to HTML keeping its formatting. X7 also intoruduces new shipping macros that enhance some aspects of the functionality. I personnally like the favourites macro that allows you to easily access frequently used documents from a toolbar menu. All of these features have been stable for me and work quite well. On the whole I like X7 better, but whether or not you need any of the new features enough to upgrade is up to you.."
10586,yes/no,B00JC5Y6WM,Can the program covert a PDF document to Word Perfect?,?,"It is supposed to be able to do so, but I just tried and it did not work. However, I am a beta tester for Acrobat and the Acrobat file was created using a beta version of Acrobat, so I suspect it does work on files created by released versions of pdf programs."
10587,yes/no,B00JC5Y6WM,Is the document transfer from Corel WordPerfect 11 to X7 possible without losses?,?,I believe it is. I installed X7 over WP-12 (not 11) with no issues whatsoever. X7 picked up all the old documents.
10588,yes/no,B00JC5Y6WM,Is it as good as Professional version,?,"Sorry, I can't answer that. I have used WP for over 25 years, but only as a fairly lightweight user. I have never used the professional version. I just know that WP is the only word processor I have ever felt comfortable with. As I can convert my documents into MSWord, I don't ever need to learn MSWord. There is one caveat - MSWord can't do right justification, and it can't do parallel columns, something WP does with just a couple of keystrokes. Therefore, some of the things that I want to convert into MSWord won't convert, but it isn't Corel's problem, it is Microsoft's. Of course, the only reason to convert anything to MSWord is to communicate with people who don't know that MSWord will read WP documents and insist on an editable document. For the rest of the world, I just publish to PDF."
10589,yes/no,B00JC5Y6WM,"For those who may have tried the Corel 30 day trial version, Is this the same version that Corel is selling at $219.99?",?,"I am not sure about the price, but I downloaded the 30 day trial version, liked it (upgrading from older version), so I simply provided payment information when requested and was given the information codes to make the files permanent. Only problem is that I do not have a backup disk, and I need to look into that so you might inquire about this before you finalize the purchase. I hope this answer helps. Dave Kerkes, Ph.D., P.E."
10590,open-ended,B00JC5Y6WM,Is this a reusable disc with no added cost or date deadline for downloading? How many uses if a disc?,,YES IT IS A REUSABLE DISC NO DATE
10591,yes/no,B00JC5Y6WM,i need to make labels. is this program compabile with avery templates,Y,"Yes, and I find it is easier to use that Microsoft Word. Select Format, then select Labels, and a long list of Avery labels appears for you to choose from."
10592,yes/no,B00JC5Y4FQ,is there a subscription fee for the blu-ray aspect? I only want to buy it once.,?,"Theoretically you may have to buy newer versions though I am still using version 11 and it is still receiving updates so it really boils down to when they decide to stop updating the older versions. In my experience it seems like you will at least get about 4 years out of it, but probably more than that, most newer bluray discs I have seen don't use the newer versions of bluray copy protection anyways. Personally I'm going to upgrade to 14 because after using the trial I found it opens alot faster than 11 and seems to be a smoother experience. Also 11 doesn't work in win 8 media center, I don't blame power dvd though because win 8 wasn't out when I bought it and it worked fine in win 7."
10593,yes/no,B00JC5Y4FQ,Will PowerDVD 14 Ultra interfere with my iTunes media files?,N,No. iTunes movies will NOT play in PowerDVD 14. Therefore you will need both.
10594,yes/no,B00JC5Y4FQ,I want to buy the product with an installation cd &amp;licence. Can you install using thiswithout getting it scanned as indicated on the cyberlink site,?,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""without getting it scanned"" but I purchased a physical copy as well. All I have to do to install is pop in the CD, install, and enter my CD key. An internet connection may be required to verify the key but I'm not sure. It's all very easy and I do recommend getting the CD because it makes it that much easier to re-install if you ever change computers or get a new hard drive."
10595,open-ended,B00JC5Y4FQ,Does this player have a 'Resume' feature? Pick up where you left off even if disk is removed or power off the PC?,,No! and you probably already found this out on the blue ray side... This feature only works on DVD's They have disabled this feature on PowerDVD 13 and 14 for Blue Ray discs.
10596,open-ended,B00JC5Y4FQ,how do you uninstall CyberLink Power Media software?,,"Download Revo Uninstaller (it's free, do a Google search for it) and follow the steps."
10597,open-ended,B00JC5Y4FQ,What's the impact of PDVD 14 using Cinavia protection? Does it prevent playing ISO files mounted as BD drives?,,No Impact and NO
10598,yes/no,B00JC5Y4FQ,Can it crash a computer,?,The program itself crashes a lot but its never crashed the computer itself.
10599,yes/no,B00JC5Y4FQ,Is there a way to not have this Power dvd 14 as a default player?,?,"In Windows 7, you can go to Control Panel - Programs - Default Programs and then change the default settings in one of the options there."
10600,open-ended,B00JC5Y4FQ,Is the license for multiple computers or a single computer,,I have it installed in 2 pc's.......but the limit of pc's i do not know.
10601,open-ended,B00JC5Y4FQ,How can i playback Blu Ray on my 4k TV ? Shows up solid green or black .. 2015 LG UF9500 .. If i use PC to lower resolution for 1080P it plays,,Your computer should have a better video card so that it can make an output resolution of 4K (3840x2160) and also use a HDMI cable rated for 4K. (I have not checked it)
10602,yes/no,B00JC5Y744,"i am currently using WordPerfect X4...In two weeks i am upgrading my Lenovo Laptop to a Windows SurfacePro3 Tablet/Laptop with Windows 8 OS... I therefore must upgrade to X7; will this ""X7 Upgrade"" product work for me?",Y,"Most definitely YES. It is a great upgrade. Anyone who is familiar with the ""reveal codes"" feature understands just how great this program is. Been using WordPerfect for 25 years and subscribe to every upgrade. Well worth it."
10603,yes/no,B00JC5Y744,Will this upgrade the older WordPerfect Office 12 version (before the X series came out)?,?,WP X7 only honors X6 and X5. The last version to go back to version 11 and up was X5.
10604,yes/no,B00JC5Y744,"does it work with MS Windows 7, and does it read Word and can be seen by Word users in emais?",Y,"Yes, it does work well with Windows &. RE emails, I never send emails as WordPerfect or Word files. There are plenty who can't read MS Word. Here in Australia, unfortunately very few use WordPerfect. If I am sending files as email attachments, I always save them as PDF files which you can do very easily in WordPerfect. I hope this helps. Pat Flanagan"
10605,open-ended,B00JC5Y744,HOW MANY INSTALLATIONS ARE ALLOWED?,,Can't remember instructions but I have installed it on three computers
10606,yes/no,B00JC5Y744,will this accept an upgrade from x5 standard?,?,I upgraded from the standard X5 to the standard X7 with no problems.
10607,yes/no,B00JC5Y744,Can I upgrade from X3 to X7?,N,No
10608,open-ended,B00JC5Y6YA,Is this an upgrade or full version? Can it be used with Windows 8? Installed my old WordPerfect3 on new Windows 8 computer - not going well!,,"WordPerfect Office 7 (Home & Student) is a full version including WordPerfect, Quattro Pro, Presentations, WP Lightning (notebook). The Box the program disk comes in says it runs on Windows 8/8.1, Windows 7, and works with XP. Hope this helps."
10609,yes/no,B00JC5Y6YA,I have three laptops that I and my children use. Can this be used more than once,?,Box said the license is good for 3 computers.
10610,yes/no,B00JC5Y6YA,Can I use this software to simply print letters etc.?,?,That is what it is for. You will need a printer.
10611,open-ended,B00JC5Y6YA,How many computers does the license allow you to run this program on?,,"My box says, ""Install on up to 3 PCs."""
10612,yes/no,B00JC5Y6YA,Does this Wordperfect Office X7 Home and Student come with any Clip Art and Borders?,Y,yes it does..... Corel is well known for its graphics
10613,open-ended,B00JC5Y6YA,Is this a rgram tht substitutes for Microsoft Office? Or is it an addititonal program?,,It is a substitute. Word perfect is a substitute for Word and also includes Quatro Pro which is a substitute for Excel. These are the two programs most people use. I prefer these over Microsoft and they are alot more inexpensive. You can also install Word Perfect on three different computers whereas Microsoft just one.
10614,open-ended,B00JC5Y6YA,How well would this work as an alternative to a PDF editor? I would use merge/split/reorder most as well as inserting text.,,"I don't believe that WP will open a .pdf file. It can create, or open test or other formats, and then publish as .pdf."
10615,open-ended,B00JC5Y6YA,How many computers can you download this program on?,,The EULA seems to imply 3 computers in the same household/address for the Home and Student edition. Other editions have lower limits if I understand the EULA correctly.
10616,open-ended,B00JC5Y6YA,Does it include Quick Correct for converting short letter combinations into full words or phrases like my old but still wonderful Word Perfect 8?,,"Yes it does have ""QuickCorrect"" and a lot of other ""Quick"" features (fill, fonts, bullets, numbers, etc.)."
10617,yes/no,B00JC5Y6YA,Does it have spread sheet and math capabilities?,Y,Yes it has a spreadsheet similar to MS Excel it's called Quattro Pro as well as Presentations similar to PowerPoint.
10618,open-ended,B00JHN1MJO,does it include payroll? how much it cost for updating after 1 year expire? does it still work for both payroll and accounting if I don't update?,,"Payroll is an additional $250 for up to 50 employees. If you want to e-file quarterly tax forms, add $67.50. If over 50 employees add $450 plus $67.50 if you would like to e-file tax forms. Once you purchase the program, Best Business Strategies or any other Sage Solution provider can order that for you. If you are using payroll, you must stay in the most current program and renew every year. At this time, the renewal is $299 plus payroll cost as indicated above. Shirley Byard, Sage 50 Master Certified Consultant, Best Business Strategies"
10619,open-ended,B00JHN1MJO,download bank data,,"I download a .QFX file from my bank. It is then imported into the reconciliation. It does not download items that are not in the system to the accounting software, but is does check off the items that are in the system and it tells you what is missing with a red flag. Answered by Shirley Byard of Best Business Strategies."
10620,open-ended,B00JHN1MJO,"hello come with your license? to get the program have a year of support, after this year much it costs? how often have to update the program.",,"Hi Michele, The exact answer depends on your situation. Are you doing payroll, using Sage Mobile services or credit card processing? If you are, you must upgrade. If not, you can keep your program on your computer for a long time without upgrades if you purchase a BASIC or TRADITIONAL license. Anything that says AUTO RENEWING must be updated every year or the program will stop. The cost is about the same as the original cost of the program less the initial purchase discounts."
10621,open-ended,B00JHN1MJO,Can this version provide simple financial statements? Income statement and balance sheet?,,"Yes, it can do all of the above. The biggest difference between this and Premium is that Pro is for one user only and it does not have ""job costing"". This answer is provided by Shirley Byard, Best Business Strategies."
10622,open-ended,B00JHN1MJO,Can you do the accounting for only 1 business or more than 1 (I need to keep track of 3) with this software?,,"Hi Linda, You can manage the accounts for multiple companies using Sage 50 Pro Accounting 2015. You can setup 3 companies if you wish to. I hope this helps. Best Regards Software onFire LLC"
10623,yes/no,B00JHN1MJO,can I do manual tax tables in this product?,?,"Unfortunately beginning with version 2013 Sage 50 no longer has a ""manual payroll module"". Of course you can always enter payroll (or anything else) in the ""general journal"". But the manual payroll module, once you set it up, would do the calculations automatically. Sage 50 took that feature away and worse. If you don't pay a yearly maintenance fee then you are no longer able to enter new data (90 days after your fee expires it locks you into ""read only mode""). It is perfectly understandable, however, since the accounting software business isn't what it used to be (due to free alternatives like ""Gnucash"" so all of these companies have to change their business models. Sage 50 is excellent excellent software. It's just not as inexpensive as it used to be."
10624,open-ended,B00JHN1MJO,I have multiple LLCs with multiple rental properties. How many LLCs can you keep track of without having to buy multiple versions of this software?,,"I am a Certified Consultant. There is no limit. The limit is not with companies, but with users. Please note, if you want to own your software, you need to purchase the basic or traditional versions. Anything that says subscription is just that. YOU WILL NEVER OWN THE SOFTWARE. Best Business Strategies only sells Basic on Amazon. If Sage says otherwise, they are just wanting your business and not telling the truth about Best Business Strategies. Please note I cannot speak for other Amazon sellers. At Best Business Strategies, we will never sell you a subscription on Amazon. Shirley Byard, Owner, Best Business Strategies. See our store on Amazon. Questions 304-233-2612."
10625,yes/no,B00JHN1MJO,Does it include Fixed Assets?,Y,"Yes, it covers all the items in a typical accounting package. If you intend to use the payroll module, please be aware that you have to buy their maintenance package in order to use it, which costs in excess of a $1000.00 yearly."
10626,yes/no,B00JHN1MJO,will this stop working if I don't renew update on traditional plan?,?,"Based on my past experience with multiple versions of peach tree, I'm going to guess not."
